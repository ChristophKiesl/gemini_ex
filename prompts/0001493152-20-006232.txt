ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Since August 1, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Verus Foods, Inc. (“Verus Foods”), an international supplier of consumer food products, have been focused on international consumer packaged goods, foodstuff distribution and wholesale trade. Our fine food products are sourced in the United States and exported internationally. We market consumer food products under our own brand primarily to supermarkets, hotels and other members of the wholesale trade. Initially, we focused on frozen foods, particularly meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and french fries with beverages as a second vertical, and in 2018, we added cold-storage facilities and began seeking international sources for fresh fruit, produce and similar perishables, as well as other consumer packaged foodstuff with the goal to create vertical farm-to-market operations. We have also begun to explore new consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) non-food categories, such as cosmetic and fragrances, for future product offerings.
 
We currently have a significant regional presence in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) and sub-Saharan Africa (excluding The Office of Foreign Assets Control restricted nations), with deep roots in the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries, which includes the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Our long-term goal is to source goods and generate international wholesale and retail CPG sales in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
 
In addition to the foregoing, since our acquisition of Big League Foods, Inc. (“BLF”) during April 2019, pursuant to which we acquired a license with Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. (“MLB”) to sell MLB-branded frozen dessert products and confections, we have been selling pint size ice cream in grocery store-type packaging and are exploring novelty “grab-and-go” size ice cream in cone, bar, and sandwich versions under our frozen dessert product line. In addition, under our confections product line, we are selling gummi and chocolate candies. The MLB license covers all 30 MLB teams, and all of our current products pursuant to such license feature “home team” packaging that matches the fan base in each region.
 
Furthermore, during August 2019, we purchased all of the assets of a french fry business including customer contracts which provide us the right to earn revenue pursuant to such contracts throughout the Middle East.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.
 
Our food products are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting the manufacturing plants and facilities of our suppliers, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental review.

Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling and nutrient profiling, marketing restrictions, potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials.
 
In addition, we are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. We are also subject to the Export Sales Reporting Program of the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) which monitors U.S. agricultural export sales on a daily and weekly basis. The program requires U.S. exporters to report sales of certain commodities to the Foreign Agricultural Service of the USDA on a weekly basis. Commodities currently covered by the program include feed grains, wheat, wheat products, rye, flaxseed, linseed oil, cotton, cottonseed, oilseed products, rice, cattle hides and skins, and beef. In addition to the weekly requirement, daily reporting is required (except for soybean oil) when a single exporter sells 100,000 metric tons or more of one commodity in one day to a single destination, or cumulative sales of 200,000 tons or more of one commodity during the weekly reporting period to a single destination. In addition to the foregoing, we must comply with The Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals targeted against foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to national security, foreign policy or economy of the United Stated.
 
Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulations or regulations that we may be subject to may be punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions and asset seizures as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.
 
Market and Competition

We generate a majority of our revenue from food imported into the GCC countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The GCC has highly developed wholesale, grocery, and retail infrastructures that attract thousands of brands from around the world. According to A.T. Kearney, there are approximately 600 food distributors in the GCC. According to reports published by Alpen Capital, halal food imports into the GCC are expected to exceed $50 billion by 2020, while food imports account for about 85% of food consumed in the GCC.
 
We also generate revenue from domestic U.S. sales of our MLB branded ice cream and gummi and chocolate candies. According to the International Dairy Foods Association, ice cream is an $11 billion industry with 1.4 billion gallons of ice cream and related frozen desserts produced in the U.S. in 2017 and according to the National Confectioners Association, the confectionary industry generates $35 billion annually.
 
In the branded product space, management believes that our key competitors in the GCC countries in which we operate include The Savola Group and Almarai which are based in Saudi Arabia; Americana Quality which is based in Kuwait; and Al Islami Foods which is based in the UAE and is currently ranked as the world’s largest Halal food vendor, with more than 80 frozen and specialty lines. In addition to the foregoing, we also compete with recognized international brands from multi-line companies such as Nestle and Mondelez International. In the U.S., management believes that our key competitors include premium ice cream brands such as Ben & Jerry’s, Breyers, and Haagen-Dazs and domestic confectionary brands in the gummi and chocolate candy space such as Mars, Mondelez International, and Nestle.
 
Although many of our competitors have greater financial, distribution and marketing resources than us, management believes there are many food categories and niches in which we can successfully compete in this highly-fragmented market. In addition, we focus on the regional sensitivities and dietary requirements of the markets we export products to. We offer both Verus Foods-branded products along with products from other brands, particularly from brands that desire to enter the GCC market, but lack the infrastructure or resources to do so. Furthermore, management believes that we are one of the only U.S. based public companies operating in the GCC that can provide its own branded products and also act as a distributor for other brands across all of the major food sales categories. Management believes that a majority of the suppliers in this space are either non-U.S. based private companies or are public entities with a narrow focus on their own brands.
