Item 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to provide these businesses with access to the same tools as large businesses. This approach aligns with our purpose of economic empowerment, as everything we do should give sellers accessible, affordable tools to grow their businesses and participate in the economy.
Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps our sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. We combine sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into powerful payment and point-of-sale solutions. We have high seller acceptance rates and fast onboarding, while maintaining low risk and fraud losses as a result of our approach to risk management that emphasizes data science and machine learning. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable. These attributes differentiate us in a fragmented industry that forces sellers to stitch together hardware, software, and payments services from multiple vendors.
The foundation of our ecosystem is a full service, managed payments offering. Once a seller downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile app, they can quickly and easily take their first payment, because we can typically bring them onto our system in minutes. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via magnetic stripe (a swipe), EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) (a dip), or NFC (Near Field Communication) (a tap); or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller’s website. Once on our system, sellers gain access to technology and features such as reporting and analytics, next-day settlements, digital receipts, payment dispute management and chargeback protection, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. On the consumer (buyer) side, Square Cash offers individuals access to a fast, easy way to send and receive money electronically to and from individuals and businesses.
Our commerce ecosystem also includes powerful point-of-sale software and services that help sellers make informed business decisions through the use of analytics and reporting. As a result, sellers can manage orders, inventory, locations, employees, and payroll; engage and grow their sales with customers; and gain access to business loans. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee. Some of these advanced point-of-sale features are broadly applicable to our seller base and include Employee Management and Customer Engagement. With our Square Capital service, we facilitate the offering of loans to sellers based on their payment processing history, and the product is broadly applicable across our seller base. We have also extended our ecosystem to serve sellers with more specific needs. Our Build with Square developer platform (APIs) allows businesses with individualized needs to customize their business solutions while processing payments on Square and taking advantage of all the services in our ecosystem, including integration with third-party applications. In addition, certain verticals, such as service and retail sellers, benefit from specific features such as Invoices, Appointments, and Square Inventory. We also serve sellers through Caviar, a food ordering service that helps restaurants reach new customers and increase sales without additional overhead.
We have grown rapidly to serve millions of sellers that represent a diverse set of industries, including retail, services, and food-related businesses, and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers’ market to multi-location businesses. These sellers also span geographies including the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia. We believe the diversity of our sellers underscores the accessibility and flexibility of our offerings. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we processed $49.7 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by 1 billion card payments from approximately 245 million payment cards. We processed $35.6 billion and $23.8 billion of GPV in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Our ability to add new sellers efficiently, and help them grow their business after they join our platform, has led to continued and sustained growth. Our existing sellers also represent a sizable opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell products and services with little incremental sales and marketing expense. Additionally, we are increasingly serving larger sellers, which we define as those that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV. GPV from larger sellers represented 42% of our GPV in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase from 39% in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Our Products and Services

Managed Payments Solutions
The foundation of our ecosystem is a full service, managed payments offering. As previously mentioned, sellers can onboard to Square in minutes, and once onboarded, a seller can accept payments in person via the swipe, dip, or tap of a card; online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller’s website; or through Square Cash, our personal finance app. By paying one transparent transaction fee, sellers receive technology and features that allow them to manage the entire payment lifecycle including reporting and analytics, next-day settlements (or instant settlement for an additional transaction fee via Instant Deposit), digital receipts, payment dispute management and chargeback protection, and PCI compliance. Transaction-based revenue as a percentage of GPV was 2.93%, 2.95%, and 2.98% in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
In-person/card present (CP) payments
For in-person payments, our affordable, custom-designed hardware can process all card payment forms, including magnetic stripe, EMV chip, and NFC technology. Sellers can accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover for one transaction fee. Our hardware includes the following products:

• | Magstripe reader: Our free magstripe reader enables swiped transactions of magnetic stripe cards by connecting with an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.


• | Contactless and chip reader: This reader accepts EMV chip cards and NFC payments, enabling acceptance via Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other mobile wallets. The reader connects wirelessly or via USB.


• | Chip card reader: Our chip card reader accepts EMV chip cards and enables swiped transactions of magnetic stripe cards by connecting with an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.


• | Square Stand: This hardware transforms an iPad into a full point-of-sale terminal. It features an integrated magnetic stripe reader, provides power to a connected iPad, and can connect to the contactless and chip reader wirelessly or via USB. Square Stand also connects to various peripheral devices that brick-and-mortar businesses need, such as barcode scanners and receipt printers.

Online/card not present (CNP) payments
Sellers can also accept online or card not present payments with Square by manually entering card information into the Square Point of Sale mobile app or into Square Virtual Terminal via a web browser. Additionally, Square Invoices allows a seller to collect payments securely by creating a custom digital invoice from Square Point of Sale or from Square Dashboard, our reporting and analytics tool, which is then emailed directly to the customer.
Square Cash
Square Cash is an easy-to-use personal finance app that allows anyone to send and receive money electronically. Individuals and businesses can sign up for a Square Cash account using just a debit card, bank account, or credit card and an email address or a phone number. Square Cash is free for individuals sending peer-to-peer payments with a debit card or bank account, or for a per transaction fee for all businesses and individuals sending peer-to-peer payments with a credit card. Individuals have multiple ways to access the money in their Square Cash account. Peer-to-peer payments users can deposit funds into their bank account within 1-3 business days for free, or instantly for a per transaction fee. Alternatively, users can store the money in Square Cash, which can be linked to a virtual Visa debit card that can be used for online purchases or in-person payments where Apple Pay is accepted. 
Square Point of Sale

Square Point of Sale is our powerful point-of-sale software that can be downloaded to any iOS or Android device and is designed to get a seller (and their employees) up and running quickly. It consists of managed payments solutions and advanced software products, all of which are integrated with one another to provide both sellers and their buyers with a cohesive experience that is fast, self-serve, and dependable. Square Point of Sale also includes Square Dashboard, our cloud-based reporting and analytics tool that provides sellers with real-time data and insights about sales, items, customers, and employees. This enables sellers to make informed decisions about their business. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee. 
Our advanced point-of-sale features are ideal for a seller with a more complex business or for a seller who has multiple employees and/or locations. Location and employee management allows a seller to track sales by location, device, or employee; customize employee permissions; and create employee timecards. Square Payroll empowers sellers to grow by making it easy to hire, onboard, and pay employees and the associated taxes. Square Point of Sale also provides customer engagement tools that help sellers grow their business through digital customer feedback, marketing, and loyalty programs. By linking customer data with point-of-sale and transaction data, we can offer targeted marketing campaigns and a closed-loop system that allows sellers to easily assess the return on investment of their marketing efforts.
Additionally, we continue to add features to Square Point of Sale to better meet the needs of specific industries, such as services, retail, and food-related sellers. Sellers in the services industry can enable their customers to easily schedule appointments with their preferred time, service, and staff member. Sellers can also send invoices to their customer’s email address, creating a seamless experience from booking to payment. And sellers in food-related industries, like bars and restaurants, can easily create, save, add to, split, and close tickets (with tip).
We recently launched Square for Retail, our first industry-specific point of sale that is purpose-built for retailers with sophisticated management needs. Square for Retail is an end-to-end solution that fully integrates with our managed payments solutions and hardware. It has a search-based user interface and fast barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders; and employee management and advanced clientèling capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers’ habits.
Developer platform
We have opened Square to reach sellers who want access to our ecosystem but also want flexibility in their solutions to meet their individualized business needs. Build with Square is our developer platform, consisting of various application program interfaces (APIs) that allow sellers and their developers to customize business solutions. Our Point-of-Sale API allows sellers to integrate any iOS or Android point of sale with Square to accept payments and access all other services in the ecosystem. This is particularly useful for sellers with highly-individualized point-of-sale needs. With our e-commerce API, sellers can integrate Square with their e-commerce website, giving them the ability to track, manage, and grow both their online and offline businesses in a single dashboard.
6

Build with Square also has APIs for sellers to integrate Square with business solutions such as item and inventory management, sales reporting and analytics, and employee management. Through the Square App Marketplace, sellers can also integrate Square with third-party apps, such as QuickBooks or BigCommerce, that create extensions to our point-of-sale functionality and other back office solutions, and enables sellers to integrate all of their business data.
Square Capital
Square Capital, through a partnership with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank, facilitates loans to pre-qualified sellers based on real-time payment and point-of-sale data. These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.
Generally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk.
Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances (MCAs), representing $1.3 billion. 
Caviar
Caviar is another service we offer that helps sellers grow and provides a differentiated way to service restaurants, a large target market for managed payments and point-of-sale solutions. This service makes it easy for restaurants to offer food delivery to their customers, enabling them to expand their sales and grow revenue without additional overhead. Individuals can order food from local restaurants through the Caviar website or mobile app, which is purpose-built to make delivery fast and easy. Caviar is currently available in many U.S. markets, including but not limited to New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, with thousands of partner restaurants. Caviar charges consumers a delivery and service fee per order. We also charge our partner restaurants a seller fee as a percentage of total food order value.
Our Sellers
Our sellers represent a diverse range of industries, including retail, services, and food-related businesses. We serve sellers of various sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers’ market to multi-location businesses. These sellers also span geographies including the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia, with further international expansion planned. We believe the diversity of our sellers underscores the accessibility and flexibility of our offerings.
We are increasingly serving larger sellers, which we define as sellers that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV. GPV from larger sellers represented 42% of total GPV in the fourth quarter of 2016, up from 39% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 33% in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had no customer who accounted for greater than 10% of our GPV or our net revenue.

Sales and Marketing
We have a strong brand and continue to increase awareness of Square among sellers by enhancing our services and fostering rapid adoption through brand affinity, direct marketing, public relations, and strategic partnerships. Our Net Promoter Score (NPS) has averaged nearly 70 over the past four quarters, which is double the average score for banking providers. Our high NPS means our sellers recommend our services to others, strengthening our brand and helping to drive efficient customer acquisition.
Direct marketing, online and offline, has also been an effective customer acquisition channel. This includes online display advertising, online search engine optimization and marketing, social media, direct mail campaigns, seller referral programs, television advertising, and trade shows and events. Additionally, Square hardware products, such as our contactless and chip reader or Square Stand, are available at over 36,000 retail stores (including Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Staples, Target, and Walgreens). Our direct sales and account management teams also contribute to the acquisition and support of larger sellers. In addition to direct channels, we work with third-party partners and developers who offer our solutions to their customers.
Our direct, ongoing interactions with our sellers help us tailor offerings to them, at scale, and in the context of their usage. We use various scalable communication channels, such as email marketing, in-app notifications and messaging, dashboard alerts, and Square Communities, our online forum for sellers, to increase the awareness and usage of our products and services with little incremental sales and marketing expense.
Product Development and Technology

We design our products and services to be cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable, and we organize our product teams accordingly, combining individuals from product management, development and engineering, data science, and design. Our products and services are mobile-first and platform-agnostic, and we are able to continuously optimize them because our hardware, software, and payments processing are integrated. We frequently update our software products and have a regular software release schedule with improvements deployed generally twice a month, ensuring our sellers get immediate access to the latest features. Our services are built on a scalable technology platform, and we place a strong emphasis on data analytics and machine learning to maximize the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability of our services. This enables us to capture and analyze over a billion transactions per year and automate risk assessment for more than 99.95% of all transactions. Our hardware is designed and developed in-house, and we contract with third-party manufacturers for production. Our product development expenses were $268.5 million, $199.6 million and $144.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Transaction Processing Overview
Processing card transactions requires close coordination among a number of industry participants that provide the services and infrastructure required to enable such transactions. These participants consist of payment service providers, acquiring processors, card networks, and issuing banks. Within this landscape, Square serves as a payment service provider, acting as the touch point for the seller to the rest of the payment chain. The definitions and graphic below outline this payment chain and the typical flow of a Square transaction, along with the types of fees typically paid and received at each stage.
Payment Service Provider (PSP): Provider of the payment services that holds the direct relationship with the seller and facilitates the rest of the transaction on behalf of the seller. A PSP is also the merchant of record for the transaction. The merchant of record is liable for the settlement of transactions processed.
Acquiring Processor: Provider of the back-end technology that facilitates the flow of payment information through the Card Networks to the Issuing Bank. Our agreements with acquiring processors typically have terms of two to four years.
Card Networks (e.g. Visa, MasterCard): Provider of the infrastructure for card payment information to flow from the Acquiring Bank to the Acquiring Processor.
Issuing Bank: The financial institution that issues the buyer’s payment card.
Acquiring Bank: The financial institution associated with the Acquiring Processor.

1. | Once the buyer is ready to make a purchase, the seller inputs the transaction into the Square Point of Sale and presents the buyer with the amount owed.


2. | For in-person transactions, the buyer pays by swiping or dipping their payment card, or by tapping their NFC-enabled payment card or mobile device on a Square Reader or Square Stand, which captures the buyer’s account information. For card not present transactions, card information is keyed in manually by either the buyer or seller into the Square Point of Sale app, Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's e-commerce website.


3. | The Square Point of Sale sends the transaction information to Square, which acts as the PSP.


4. | Square passes the transaction information to the Acquiring Processor via an internet connection. Square pays a small fixed fee per transaction to the Acquiring Processor.


5. | The Acquiring Processor routes the transaction to the appropriate Card Network affiliated with the buyer’s card such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or American Express. Square pays a variety of fees to the Card Network, the most significant of which are assessment fees that are typically less than 0.15% of the transaction amount.

10


6. | The Acquiring Processor then routes the transaction through the Card Network to the Issuing Bank, which authorizes or declines the transaction for the buyer’s payment card.


7. | Upon authorization, the Issuing Bank sends a notification back through the Card Network to the Square Point of Sale to inform the seller that the transaction has been successfully authorized.


8. | The Square Point of Sale sends a digital receipt for the transaction to the buyer, enabling a persistent communication channel between the seller and the buyer. For example, this is how the buyer can send feedback to the seller about the service provided.


9. | The Issuing Bank then triggers a disbursement of funds to the Acquiring Bank through the Card Network for the transaction amount. Square will ultimately pay the Issuing Bank an interchange fee as a percentage of the amount of the transaction plus a fixed fee per transaction, which together average between 1.5% to 2.0% of the transaction amount. However, this percentage can vary significantly based on the card type, transaction type, and transaction size.


10. | Square transfers the funds to the seller’s bank account, net of the fee charged by Square. Square provides sellers with fast access to funds, typically settling with them by the business day after the date of the transaction via Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, or the same day via its Instant Deposit service for an additional transaction fee. Square pays a very small fee for each ACH transfer.


11. | The funds are settled from the Acquiring Bank to Square, typically in one to two business days after the date of the transaction.


12. | At the end of the month, the Issuing Bank sends a statement to the buyer showing their monthly charges. The statement includes a reference to Square as the merchant of record on the billing statement as a prefix to the seller name (denoted as SQ).

Our Competition
The markets in which we operate are competitive and evolving. Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies.
We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our commerce ecosystem and our focus on building products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable. With respect to each of these factors, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors.

For payments and point-of-sale services, we compete primarily with traditional acquiring processors and payment processors who sell costly card terminal and point-of-sale systems, often tied to long-term contracts, through direct sales or Independent Sales Organization (ISO) channels. Many competitors offer payments and point-of-sale services that have features tailored to particular industries or business types but require sellers to stitch together technology from multiple hardware, software, and payments vendors.
Some sellers may elect to use individual point-of-sale solutions from other companies that overlap with certain functions and features that we provide, including:

• | Business software providers such as those that provide inventory management, analytics, customer management and marketing, e-commerce, and appointment solutions;


• | Established or new alternative lenders;


• | Delivery service providers; and


• | Peer-to-peer payment providers.

11

Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as on contractual measures. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, registered domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property.
We have developed a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our products, services, and technologies where appropriate. As of December 31, 2016, we had 229 issued patents and 588 filed patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions relating to a variety of aspects of our technology. Our issued patents will expire between 2022 and 2035. We intend to file additional patent applications as we continue to innovate through our research and development efforts and to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we deem it beneficial and cost-effective.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, trade dress, and domain names in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of U.S. and international domain names that include the term “Square” and variations thereof.
From time to time, we also incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology did not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed in every case.
Government Regulation
Foreign and domestic laws and regulations apply to many key aspects of our business. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate.
Payments Regulation
Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the United States and globally. For example, certain jurisdictions in the United States require a license to offer money transmission services, such as our peer-to-peer payments product, Square Cash, and we maintain a license in each of those jurisdictions and comply with new license requirements as they arise. We are also registered as a “Money Services Business” with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These licenses and registrations subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies.
Outside the United States, we provide localized versions of some of our services to customers, including through various foreign subsidiaries. For example, in Canada, Japan, and Australia, Square Point of Sale is the sole payments service we offer. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For instance, we are registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), as required by anti-money laundering rules, to provide payments services in Australia. 
Our payments services may be or become subject to regulation by other authorities, and the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are always subject to interpretation and change.
Consumer Financial Protection
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, local, state, and foreign regulatory agencies regulate financial products, including credit, deposit, and payments services, and other similar services. These agencies have broad consumer protection mandates, and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business.
12

Anti-Money Laundering
We are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have implemented an AML program designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity. Our program is also designed to prevent our network from being used to facilitate business in countries, or with persons or entities, included on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent foreign authorities. Our AML compliance program includes policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, including the designation of an AML compliance officer, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
Protection and Use of Information
We collect and use a wide variety of information to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, and protection of the information we acquire from our own services as well as from third-party sources, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States and elsewhere. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information. As our business continues to expand in the United States and worldwide, and as laws and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve, additional laws and regulations may become relevant to us.
Communications Regulation
We send texts, emails, and other communications in a variety of contexts, such as when providing digital receipts. Communications laws, including those promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, apply to certain aspects of this activity in the United States and elsewhere.
Additional Developments
Various regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact our business, including products liability, import and export compliance, accessibility for the disabled, insurance, marketing, privacy, and labor and employment matters. As our business continues to develop and expand, additional rules and regulations may become relevant. For example, if we choose to offer Square Payroll in more jurisdictions, additional regulations, including tax rules, will apply.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,853 full-time employees. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
