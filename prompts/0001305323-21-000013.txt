BUSINESS
Overview
Zovio Inc is an education technology services company that partners with higher education institutions and employers to deliver a suite of innovative, personalized solutions and learning experiences to help learners and leaders achieve their aspirations and help institutions grow. Zovio’s expertise across academic disciplines, credential levels, learning experiences, and modalities has powered student and partner success through a tailored, customer-focused approach bolstered by data analytics. The Company provides student recruitment and enrollment systems, retention strategies, educational tools and curriculums.
Sale Transaction
Until December 1, 2020, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Ashford University, LLC, a California limited liability company (“AU LLC”), owned and operated Ashford University, a regionally-accredited, online university (the “University”). The University’s mission is to provide high-quality, accessible, affordable, and innovative educational programs that meet the diverse needs of individuals pursuing advancement in their lives, professions, and communities. The University is helping to define the modern college experience by providing the flexibility and effectiveness of online learning. The University offers associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs online.
On December 1, 2020, the Company and AU LLC finalized the Purchase Agreement, by and among the Company, AU LLC, the University of Arizona and Global Campus. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Sale Transaction”), Global Campus owns and operates the University in affiliation with the University of Arizona with a focus on expanding access to education for non-traditional adult learners and the Company will provide services to Global Campus under a long-term Strategic Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”). 
Our Business
The services that the Company provides to Global Campus under the Services Agreement include recruiting, admissions, marketing, student finance, financial aid processing, and financial aid advising, program advising, student retention advising, support services for academics, information technology and institutional support. See further details within “Services Provided” below. For additional information regarding the impact of the Sale Transaction, see Note 3, “Financial Statement Reclassification” to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In April 2019, we acquired Fullstack Academy, Inc. (“Fullstack”) an award-winning, immersive coding bootcamp offering web development and cybersecurity training to students looking for competitive paying and in-demand tech jobs. Fullstack offers full- and part-time programs in New York and Chicago, in addition to working with colleges and universities to expand their program offerings and close technological skills gaps in their local communities. In January 2016, Fullstack launched Grace Hopper Academy, the first all-women coding bootcamp in New York City and the first in the country to offer a deferred tuition model.
Also in April 2019, we acquired TutorMe.com, Inc. (“TutorMe”), which provides 24/7 tutoring services. Students are matched online with tutors within 30 seconds who can help them with more than 300 subjects. With live video chat, whiteboarding, and screen sharing, students can get the personalized help they need, in the subject they need, at a time that works for them. TutorMe optimizes the student learning journey and is a valuable-resources for high-school and college students. TutorMe is also offered as an employee benefit, providing an added benefit for parents of high-school students.
Services Provided
Technology and academic services
Technology and academic services primarily relate to the educational infrastructure, including online course delivery and management, assessment, customer relations management and other internal administrative systems. This also includes providing support for curriculum and new program development, support for faculty training and development, technical support and assistance with state compliance.
Information Technology
We have created or adopted a scalable technology system that we believe is secure, reliable and redundant, and permits courses and support services to be offered online.
Online course delivery and management - We utilize the Canvas learning management system provided by Instructure, Inc. (“Instructure”), a third-party software and services provider. Canvas is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform that enables us to develop and deliver the latest in engaging online learning experiences. As a native cloud platform, Canvas software and data are hosted by Amazon Web Services, providing for a fast, secure and readily scalable experience for students and faculty. Additionally, students and faculty will have greater flexibility to learn and teach from anywhere, anytime and on any iOS or Android device.
Internal administration - We utilize customer relations management (“CRM”) application from Salesforce for lead management, workflow, analytics, reporting and a complete view of our students. This tool enables institutions to view the entire student history from the lead to graduation, individually or in cohorts, and to respond appropriately. Additionally, the online application portals can be utilized to accept, integrate and process student applications. We support various channels of communication with students and prospects to provide engagement through a student’s preferred means of communication.
Constellation - Constellation is an innovative suite of interactive educational materials that increases the educational quality for online students. Constellation is our proprietary learning platform that takes the best features of traditional textbooks and combines them with the best features of the internet to create a premium student experience. We developed Constellation as an alternative to third-party textbooks with digital course materials. Constellation gives students access to their digital course materials across platforms without sacrificing time-tested studying tools like highlighting and note taking. Constellation includes customized content geared to courses and students, combined with a robust set of features that make course materials engaging and accessible to students of various learning styles and abilities. Constellation is cloud-based and is compatible across operating systems, browsers and mobile technologies, including web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices. We have developed Constellation-enabled courses primarily in core classes to attempt to reach as many students as possible.
The Constellation team includes editors with extensive experience at leading textbook publishing firms. Highly qualified subject matter experts are recruited to author content that addresses course and institutional outcomes. Constellation digital texts are organized around accelerated courses.
Waypoint Outcomes - Waypoint Outcomes is our proprietary assessment software which provides learning and assessment tools to institutions. The software combines classic rubric grading scales with easy, efficient technology to help educators teach writing, critical thinking and cognitive skills. Its sophisticated grading palette frees teachers to focus on meaningful, personalized feedback for students by automating repetitive tasks. Data results from Waypoint Outcomes are shared with the student and are also accessible by the faculty and program administrators.
Signalz - We offer student success and student recruitment service through Signalz, which is our proprietary predictive analytics platform that provides data-driven insights to enhance our client offering and improve overall results and outcomes. Signalz enables Zovio to develop solutions and engineer workflows that optimize performance metrics from marketing through graduation.
Mobile application technology - We offer mobile applications compatible with most web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices in order to increase the accessibility of the student learning experience. The applications enable students to use their mobile device to contact support staff, complete discussion posts and review important information regarding their academic status. We have received positive feedback from students indicating that these mobile applications further their learning experience, and we have incorporated feedback received into the periodic updates to these mobile applications.
Support Services for Academics
We work alongside our university partners to help design programs and academic offerings to meet the needs of a broad cross-section of prospective students. We seek to offer programs in disciplines in which we believe there is strong demand for education and significant opportunity for employment.
Potential new programs and specializations are determined based on proposals submitted by faculty and staff and an assessment of overall market demand. Our university partners faculty and academic leadership work in collaboration with our marketing team to research and select new programs that are expected to have strong demand and that can be developed at a reasonable cost. Programs are reviewed and must also receive approval through the normal governance process at the relevant institution. Once a program is selected for development, one or more subject matter experts are assigned to work with curriculum development staff to define measurable program-level student learning objectives. Each course in a program is 
designed to include learning activities that address the program objectives, foster student engagement and assess learning outcomes. Following approval, an online program is conformed to the standards of our online learning management system and our marketing department creates a marketing plan for the program.
We seek to maintain a high level of quality in curriculum and student support services, all of which contribute to the overall student experience. The curricula are reviewed periodically to ensure that content is refined and updated as necessary. We provide support services, including in the areas of library, writing center, tutoring, help desk and administration to help maximize the success of our university partners’ students.
We have developed and implemented a comprehensive assessment plan focused on student learning and effective instruction. The plan stipulates assessment of learning outcomes at the course, program and institutional levels. Learning outcomes are unique to the institution and demonstrate the skills that graduates should be able to demonstrate upon completion of their respective programs. With the assistance of our dedicated assessment team, we can help evaluate and revise courses and learning resources based upon outcomes and institutional research data. Using direct and indirect measurements, student performance is assessed on an ongoing basis to help ensure student success.
Counseling services and support
Counseling services and support consist primarily of team-based counseling and other support to prospective and current students as well as financial aid processing.
Recruiting and Admissions
Zovio organizes its employees in teams who facilitate all aspects of a student’s enrollment and placement into a program of study. These teams consist of enrollment service advisors, financial services advisors and academic advisors. This structure promotes internal accountability among employees involved in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining new students. The admissions process is designed to offer access to prospective students who seek the benefits of a postsecondary education.
Prospective student leads are managed through a CRM system, which directs a lead for a prospective student to a recruiting team and assigns an enrollment service advisor within that team to serve as the primary liaison for that prospective student. Once contact with a prospective student is established, the enrollment service advisor, along with the academic and financial services advisors, begins an assessment process to determine if a university partner’s program offerings match the student's needs and objectives. Additionally, enrollment service advisors communicate other criteria, including expected duration and cost of the program, to the prospective student.
The enrollment service advisors go through a comprehensive training program that addresses academic offerings, financial aid options and the regulatory environment in which we operate, including the restrictions imposed by regulations on the admissions process. We place significant emphasis on regulatory requirements and operate in an environment of strict compliance.
Zovio has a presence in both military and corporate channels. Our military and academic outreach teams work with military education services officers to demonstrate the quality, impact and value that university partner’s programs provide to individuals in those organizations. Military students may frequently change locations or seek to complete a program intermittently over the course of several years. In the corporate channel, the corporate partnership programs provide companies with the opportunity to allow their employees to pursue and complete a college degree while incurring little to no student debt.
Student Financing and Financial Aid Processing
Zovio has dedicated staff that provide call center and transactional processing services for the online financial aid student populations, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and fund returns under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV”). We believe this improves student financing outcomes and enhances efforts to comply with Title IV and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Students finance their education through a combination of various financing options, including both Title IV programs and non-Title IV funding sources. Non-Title IV funding sources consist primarily of payments made in cash by individuals, private loans from third parties, reimbursement from corporate affiliates and government tuition assistance programs for military personnel, including veterans.
If a student attends any institution certified as Title IV eligible by the U.S. Department of Education (the “Department”) and meets applicable student eligibility standards, that student may receive grants, loans, or both grants and loans to help fund their education under programs authorized by Title IV. An institution participating in federal student financial aid programs authorized by Title IV must ensure that all program funds are accounted for and disbursed properly. To continue receiving program funds, students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress toward the completion of their program of study.
Student Retention Advising
Once a student enrolls in an online program, Zovio provides consistent, ongoing support to assist the student in acclimating to the online environment and to address challenges that arise in order to increase the likelihood that the student will persist through graduation. Providing a superior student support experience is a key component in retaining students. We believe that our team-based approach to recruitment and the robust student services we provide enhance retention because of the quality of each student’s interaction with his or her team and the accountability inherent in the team structure. We also incorporate a systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their experience, providing encouragement and highlighting their progress. There are frequent personal interactions between academic advisors and students, which we view as a key component to our retention strategy. We have a team that monitors performance metrics and other key data to analyze student retention rates, as well as the causes of and potential risks for student drops.
Marketing and communication
Marketing and communication services consist primarily of lead acquisition, digital communication strategies, brand identity advertising, media planning and strategy, video, data science and analysis, marketing to potential students and other promotional and communication services.
We have invested significant resources in developing processes and implementing technologies that allow us to effectively identify, recruit and retain qualified students. We develop and participate in various marketing activities to generate leads for prospective students and to build the Zovio and university brands.
For the online student population, our university partners align themselves with working adults, many of whom have already completed some postsecondary courses. The admissions policies are focused on attracting students with a greater commitment to completing their degrees.
The branding campaigns utilize digital channels to communicate their message, and leads are generated from online sources. We also purchase keywords from search providers to generate online leads directly, rather than acquiring them solely through aggregators. Additionally, we have a team internally who focuses on generating online leads through search engine optimization techniques.
Environmental, Social and Governance Programs
Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in our Company. These criteria, and the activities making up each area, have long been a part of the way we operate. The way we approach sustainability at our facilities, the way we interact with our communities, the processes by which we make our decisions and our people-first culture all contribute to our ESG program.
Environmental Matters
We believe that the facilities we do occupy are state-of-the-art and are in substantial compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
Optimizing and conserving our resources through sustainable practices are at the center of our Company’s focus on the environment. With a mindset of continuous improvement, we focus on being sustainable by using industry-leading technologies within our facilities and supporting systems to minimize the impact on the environment. We have many initiatives in the areas of conserving energy and reducing waste at our facilities. Our Arizona-based 131,000 square-foot headquarters generates 478kWh of solar power that provides at least 32% of the electricity needs, 24 electric car charging stations, and energy-efficient LED lighting. Additionally, two biophilic plant walls containing more than 1,300 individual plants can be found throughout the two-story building. Efforts such as this have helped us in being awarded the 2020 Arizona Red Award for Office Interiors Project of the Year. We have also identified and implemented methods that improve resource conservation and maintain compliance with the U.S. Green Building Council, in addition to federal, state, and local regulations.
Our services provided are conducted primarily online, which inherently has a friendlier impact on the environment. As a leader in online education, our focus is to drive sustainability through our products and services. Our programs are 100% online, and courseware is 100% digital. In addition, we do not have a physical classroom and emphasize a distributed workforce to reducing the physical footprint of our employees, staff, and professors. Zovio emphasizes a digital environment and virtual classrooms are methods to reduce energy, materials, and transportation needed to create and attend physical classrooms.
Human Capital Management and Social Awareness
A key pillar of our corporate strategy is attracting, developing, and retaining top talent with a shared purpose to help everyone be in a class of their own. The Company is committed to building a culture where ambitious individuals can come together to create innovative solutions for a brighter future. We subscribe to a set of beliefs—make meaningful connections, craft exceptional experiences, all voices matter, develop bold ideas—that guide how we interact, champion change, and inspire others.
In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic had a direct impact on our employees. We immediately pivoted the vast majority of our workforce to remote work with minimal disruption while implementing additional safety measures for employees conducting critical on-site work. Despite the challenging economic realities brought on by the pandemic, Zovio added 569 new positions, hiring workers from many of the community’s hardest-hit industries. To minimize risk to employees, nearly 90% of new hires in 2020 onboarded and trained remotely. New hires obtained all the necessary tools and resources to be successful in a remote setting through our creative curbside pick-up process. We also offered flexible work schedules and offered additional time off for those with unforeseen caregiving responsibilities due to COVID-19.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries employed over 1,550 individuals, 1,505 of which were full-time. This includes staff in university services, academic advising and academic support, enrollment services, university administration, financial aid, marketing, information technology, human resources, legal and compliance, external affairs, corporate accounting, finance and other administrative functions. At the conclusion of 2020, Zovio’s workforce was 60% female and 40% male and women represented 55% of those in leadership roles.
To attract, retain, and inspire our talent, we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits programs that support our employees through the entire employee lifecycle. Our compensation and benefits program includes: base pay, short-term incentives, cash and stock-based long-term incentives, an employee savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with an employer match, an employee stock purchase plan, health and wellness benefits, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, and an employee assistance program. Additionally, we offer an on-site gym and café with healthy food alternatives, a fully-staffed Health and Wellness Center, lifestyle coaching, ergonomic programs, and financial education and coaching to help employees reach their personal financial goals. The Company also benchmarks positions and regularly reviews the design of employee compensation and benefits programs to ensure we remain competitive with the market. We undertake an external third-party facilitated pay equity analysis annually and conduct regular internal assessments on pay disparities and make adjustments as necessary.
Creating a culture that embraces diversity, where all employees feel supported and valued, is paramount to delivering innovative solutions to our university partners and students. Our employees participate in an annual survey to measure overall engagement. In 2020, 81% of our employees reported that they have pride in the Company, intend to stay, get intrinsic motivation from their work and would refer the Company as a great place to work.
The Company is committed to developing its people where employees are empowered to drive their own career progression. The Company provides training to its employees annually, focusing on on-the-job development and on-demand learning. For those interested in taking on leadership roles, our Leadership Education and Development LEAD program is designed to provide new leaders with the basic tenants of leading, ensuring they are well-supported as they take on this important role in the organization.
To support personal and professional growth, Zovio offers tuition reimbursement programs. Employees can receive a discount or waiver for courses offered by Global Campus. We also provide a tuition benefit, up to $5,250 annually, alongside a College Savings 529 Plan and Student Debt Repayment program for eligible employees. We also offer free online tutoring services for employees and their dependents as many parents turned to virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fiscal year 2020 was particularly challenging given the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, Zovio supported the Arizona Coronavirus Relief Fund, Chandler Chamber of Commerce’s COVID-19 Relief Program, United Way Workplace Campaign, food drives, community laptop drives, and provided materials to support online instruction to our educational partners.
We understand the life-changing impact that education resources can have on individuals, no matter their background, experience, or career goals. Zovio supports nonprofit organizations aligned with our pillars of “Opportunities for All” and “Learning Beyond the Classroom” through our Corporate Giving program. In 2020, Zovio supported six educational partners including Arizona Tech Council, Greater Phoenix Chamber Foundation, Jobs for Arizona’s Graduates, Center for the Future of Arizona, Wounded Warriors Project, and The Johnston Family Foundations for Urban Agriculture. All Zovio employees are provided 16 hours of paid time off to volunteer at nonprofit organizations of their choice. In 2020, Zovio employees logged more than 5,100 volunteer hours, either virtually or in person.
Our culture is anchored in a long-standing commitment to giving back to the communities in which our employees live and work. Since 2005, the Company has donated over $11 million in charitable contributions. Our employees have collectively given 160,000 hours in volunteer efforts and have generously donated over $2.2 million through workplace giving campaigns.
Governance Standards
Management of the Company is led by talented leaders with deep experience in education and technology. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “board”) sets high standards for the Company’s employees, officers and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. It is the duties of the board to serve as a prudent fiduciary for stockholders and to oversee the management of the Company’s business. To fulfill its responsibilities and to discharge its duty, the board follows the procedures and standards that are set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, committee charters and other governance documents, which can be viewed on our corporate website at www.ir.zovio.com.
Segment Information
Prior to December 1, 2020, the Company operated in one segment for reporting purposes. Following the Sale Transaction on December 1, 2020, we now operate our business in two reportable segments, including the University Partners Segment and the Zovio Growth Segment. The Company’s reportable segments are determined based on (i) financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), (ii) internal management and related reporting structure, and (iii) the basis upon which the CEO makes resource allocation decisions. The Company’s University Partners Segment includes the technology and services provided to colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. The inaugural partner in the University Partners Segment is Global Campus. The Company’s Zovio Growth Segment includes our other subsidiaries, including Fullstack and TutorMe.
Seasonality
Our operations are generally subject to seasonal trends. Our university partner generally experiences a seasonal increase in new enrollments during the first quarter of each year, subsequent to holiday break, as well as during the third quarter each year, when most other colleges and universities begin their fall semesters. While our university partner enrolls students throughout the year, the fourth quarter revenue generally is lower than other quarters due to the holiday break in December, with an increase in the first quarter of each year.
Competition
The education technology services market is fairly new, with no individual company representing a significant market share. The postsecondary education market is also highly fragmented and competitive, with no private or public institution representing a significant market share.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. In certain instances, course content is produced by faculty and other content experts under work-for-hire agreements pursuant to which we own the course content in return for a fixed development fee. In certain limited cases, course content is licensed from third parties on a royalty fee basis.
Geographic Information
We have no significant foreign operations or assets located outside of the United States. For information about our revenues from external customers, measures of profits and losses, and total assets, see our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additional Information
We were incorporated in Delaware in May 1999 under the name TeleUniversity, Inc. In February 2004, we changed our name to Bridgepoint Education, Inc., and in April 2019, we changed our name to Zovio Inc. Our website is located at www.zovio.com. We make available free of charge on our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The website for the SEC is located at www.sec.gov. The reference to our website is intended to be an inactive textual reference and the contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulation
Through December 1, 2020, we were the owner and operator of a for-profit university and certain of the regulatory factors set forth below are the risks associated with that business. Upon the consummation of the Sale Transaction on December 1, 2020, we became a third-party service provider of education services to Global Campus, our inaugural university partner. Given that our revenue from operations is currently derived primarily from our contractual relationship with Global Campus, the regulations attributable to Global Campus operating as a non-profit university could materially affect us. The following section describes regulatory matters that affect us as a service provider to Global Campus and to institutions of higher education generally.
Institutions that participate in Title IV programs are subject to an extensive set of laws and regulations. To participate in Title IV programs, an institution must maintain authorization by the state education agency or agencies where it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department and be certified by the Department as an eligible institution. Accrediting agencies provide an independent assessment of educational quality. The laws, regulations and standards of an accrediting body, the Department and state agencies affect the vast majority of our university partner operations.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of an educational institution and its programs and an institution’s effectiveness in carrying out its mission in areas including integrity, student performance, curriculum, educational effectiveness, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, financial stability and governance. To be recognized by the Department, an accrediting agency, among other things, must adopt specific standards to be maintained by educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institution's compliance with those standards, monitor compliance through periodic institutional reporting and the periodic renewal process and publicly designate those institutions that meet the agency’s criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review by its accrediting agency to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity, quality and other standards required for accreditation. An institution that is determined not to meet the standards of accreditation may have its accreditation revoked or not renewed.
Accreditation is important to an institution, as it establishes comprehensive criteria designed to promote educational quality and effectiveness. Accreditation also represents a public acknowledgment by a recognized independent agency of the quality and effectiveness of an institution’s programs. It also facilitates the transferability of educational credits when students transfer to or apply for graduate school at other regionally accredited colleges and universities. The Department relies on accreditation as an indicator of educational quality and effectiveness in determining an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, as do certain corporate and government sponsors in connection with tuition reimbursement and other student aid programs.
Global Campus, our university partner, is regionally accredited by WASC Senior College and University Commission (“WSCUC”), educational licensing authorities in states where it is physically located or conducts certain operations, and by the Department due to Global Campus’s participation in Title IV programs. WSCUC is one of seven regional accrediting agencies that accredits colleges and universities in the United States. Accreditation by WSCUC is recognized by the Department and by prospective students as a reliable indicator of educational quality.
In July 2020, and in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company submitted to WSCUC a substantive change application for a change in ownership which requires review and approval by the Substantive Change Committee and the Structural Change Committee of WSCUC. On November 12, 2020, WSCUC notified the Company that it had approved the change of control application filed to complete the Sale Transaction, subject to certain conditions. Additionally, WSCUC notified the Company that WSCUC will conduct a post-implementation site visit of Global Campus within six months of the closing of the Sale Transaction.
On December 1, 2020, the parties to the Purchase Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the University of Arizona and Global Campus waived the closing condition regarding issuance of a pre-acquisition review notice by the Department. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Closing was subject to customary closing conditions for transactions in this sector. As a result, on December 1, 2020, the parties consummated the Sale Transaction, and Global Campus now owns and operates the University in affiliation with the University of Arizona.
Department Regulation of Title IV Programs
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and the regulations thereunder that are administered by the Department. The Department is expected to conduct a post-closing review of Global Campus following the Sale Transaction consistent with the Department’s procedures during which the Department makes a determination on the institution’s request for recertification from the Department following the change of control, including whether to impose or place other conditions or restrictions on Global Campus. 
Among other things, the law and regulations require that an institution (i) be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located, (ii) maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized for such purposes by the Department and (iii) be certified to participate in Title IV programs by the Department. Participation in Title IV programs allows for extensive oversight and review pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department. Those regulations are subject to revision and amendment from time to time by the Department. The Department’s interpretation of its regulations likewise is subject to change. As a result, it is difficult to predict how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
An institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions, and it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs.
The provisions of the Higher Education Act include being in compliance with the following:
•The 90/10 rule - A proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years, as calculated in accordance with Department regulations. This rule is commonly referred to as the “90/10 rule.” Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year is placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures.
•Cohort default rate - For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a “cohort default rate.” An institution may lose eligibility to participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year. The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for Ashford University prior to the Sale Transaction for the 2017 and 2016 federal fiscal years were 14.7%, and 13.7%, respectively.
•Financial responsibility - The Department regulations establish standards of financial responsibility that an institution must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. One financial responsibility standard is based on the institution’s composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the Department, resulting in a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. An institution’s composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department financial oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, meet all its financial obligations, be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. If an institution fails to satisfy the Department’s financial responsibility requirements, it could be limited in its access to or lose Title IV program funding, or it may be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions to its continued participation in Title IV programs. Following the Sale Transaction, the University is no longer owned by Zovio, and therefore Global Campus will submit its stand-alone audited financial statements to the Department for the purpose of calculating the University’s composite score.
Borrower Defense to Repayment
On October 28, 2016, the Department had published borrower defense to repayment regulations to change processes that assist students in gaining relief under certain provisions of the Direct Loan Program regulations. These defense to repayment regulations allow a borrower to assert a defense to repayment on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, any other misrepresentation in cases where certain other factors are present, a breach of contract or a favorable nondefault contested judgment against a school for its act or omission relating to the making of the borrower’s loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided. In addition, the financial responsibility standards contained in the new regulations establish the conditions or events that trigger the requirement for an institution to provide the Department with financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security against potential institutional liabilities. Triggering conditions or events include, among others, certain state, federal or accrediting agency actions or investigations, and in the case of publicly traded companies, receipt of certain warnings from the SEC or the applicable stock exchange, or the failure to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC. The new regulations also prohibit schools from requiring that students agree to settle future disputes through arbitration.
On March 15, 2019, the Department issued guidance for the implementation of parts of the regulations. The guidance covers an institution’s responsibility in regard to reporting mandatory and discretionary triggers as part of the financial responsibility standards, class action bans and pre-dispute arbitration agreements, submission of arbitral and judicial records, and repayment rates.
On August 30, 2019, the Department finalized the regulations derived from the 2017-2018 negotiated rulemaking process and subsequent public comments. This version of the borrower defense regulations applies to all federal student loans made on or after July 1, 2020, and, among other things: grants borrowers the right to assert borrower defense to repayment claims against institutions, regardless of whether the loan is in default or in collection proceedings; allows borrowers to file defense to repayment claims three years from either the student’s date of graduation or withdrawal from the institution; and gives students the ability to allege a specific amount of financial harm and to obtain relief in an amount determined by the Department, which may be greater or lesser than their original claim amount. The regulations also include financial triggers and other factors for recalculating an institution’s financial responsibility composite score that differ from those in the 2016 regulations.
On June 8, 2020, President Trump vetoed House Joint Resolution 56, a Congressional Review Act resolution that would block the Trump administration’s rewrite of the Obama administration’s borrower defense to repayment rule. On June 26, 2020, the House of Representatives failed to override President Trump’s veto. The rewritten borrower’s defense to repayment rule went into effect on July 1, 2020 and will apply to any federal student loans made on that date or after.
In July 2020, the Department notified Zovio that the Department would be initiating a preliminary review of borrower defense applications from borrowers who made claims regarding the University. As part of the initial fact-finding process, the Department will send individual student claims to the University and allow the institution the opportunity to submit a response to the borrower’s allegations. Zovio has begun to receive these claims and is reviewing and compiling the individual facts of each case to submit to the Department for the Department’s review. Zovio has responded to everything received and cannot predict the outcome of this review at this time. 
Potential sanctions for noncompliance with Title IV regulations
The Department can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including:
•transferring an institution from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permit the institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which delay an institution’s receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the Department;
•imposing a monetary liability against an institution in an amount equal to any funds determined to have been improperly disbursed or not to have been properly returned upon student withdrawal;
•requiring an institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department as a condition for continued Title IV eligibility;
•initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate an institution’s participation in Title IV programs;
•referring a matter for possible civil or criminal investigation;
•failing to grant an institution’s application for renewal of its certification, or revocation of an institution’s provisional certification, to participate in Title IV programs, or imposing conditions on its participation in Title IV programs; or
•taking emergency action to suspend an institution’s participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or a prior opportunity for a hearing.
Privacy of student records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and the Department’s FERPA regulations require educational institutions to, among other things, protect the privacy of students’ educational records by limiting an institution’s disclosure of a student’s personally identifiable information without the student’s prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the Department may require the institution to take corrective action or may terminate the institution’s receipt of federal funds. Educational institutions are also obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which requires an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective action, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC.
