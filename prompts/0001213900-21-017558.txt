--------+---------

The Company
 
The Company is a corporation incorporated under the laws of Florida on September 21, 2005, which focuses on the business of using proprietary technology to provide e-banking and e-commerce services delivering mobile banking, online banking, prepaid debit and digital content services to the unbanked, underbanked and underserved communities. The Company’s exclusivity with CIMA’s proprietary software platform enables Cuentas to offer comprehensive financial services and additional robust functionality that is absent from other General-Purpose Reloadable Cards (“GPR”).
Operating Subsidiaries. The Company’s business operations are conducted primarily through its subsidiaries, described elsewhere in this report.
 
Properties. The Company’s headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.
 
Our Business
 
The Fintech Card is a GPR integrated into a proprietary robust ecosystem that protects customers by depositing their funds in an FDIC insured bank account at the Issuing Bank. The comprehensive financial services include:

Direct ACH Deposits | ATM Cash Withdrawal | Bill Pay and Online Purchases 
------------------------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------
Debit Card Network Processing | Peer to Peer Payments | Cash Reload at over 50,000 retailers
Online banking | Transit Authority Fare Recharges | Discounted Gift Cards 

 
The ecosystem includes a mobile wallet for digital currency, stored value card balances, prepaid telecom minutes, loyalty reward points, and purchases made in the Cuentas Virtual Marketplace. The Fintech Card is integrated with the Los Angeles Metro, Connecticut Transit Authority and Grand Rapids Transit system to store mass transit currency and pay for transit access via the Cuentas Digital Wallet
 
The Fintech Card stores products purchased in the Cuentas Virtual Market Place where Tier-1 retailers, virtual in-game currencies, Amazon Cash, and cellular telecom prepaid minutes “top ups”. Additionally, well-known brand name restaurants sell discounted prepaid gift cards in the Cuentas Virtual Marketplace.
 
The Latino Market
 
The name “Cuentas” is a Spanish word that has multiple meanings and was chosen for strategic reasons, to develop a close relationship with the Spanish speaking population. It means “Accounts” as in “bank accounts” and it can also mean “You can count on me” as in “Cuentas conmigo”. Additionally, it can be used to “Pay or settle accounts” (saldar cuentas), “accountability” (rendición de cuentas), “to be accountable” (rendir cuentas) and other significant meanings.
 
The U.S. Latino population numbers 43.8 million U.S. immigrants, according to the 2017 FDIC Survey. It excludes immigrants, illegal aliens and undocumented individuals. The FDIC defines the “unbankable” as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another. The Federal Reserve estimated that there were approximately 55 million unbanked or underbanked adult Americans in 2018, which account for 22 percent of U.S. households. The Latino demographic is more distrusting of banking institutions and generally have more identification, credit, and former bank account issues more so than any other U. S. minority group.

The Fintech Card is positioned to service the Latino demographic with comprehensive financial products that do not require any visits to bank branches, and our fees are completely transparent via the Cuentas Digital Wallet and online banking. Most importantly our strategic banking partner, Sutton Bank, is able to use various forms of U.S. and some foreign government issued identification to confirm qualification.
 
The Cuentas General-Purpose Reloadable Card
 
The Cuentas Mastercard acts as a comprehensive banking solution marketed toward the over 20 million unbanked U.S. Latino community. The “unbanked” is described by the FDIC as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another. The Federal Reserve estimated that there were approximately 55 million unbanked or underbanked adult Americans in 2018, which account for 22 percent of U.S. households. The Cuentas Mastercard is enabling access to the U.S. financial system to those without the necessary paperwork to bank at a traditional financial institution while enabling greater functionality than a traditional bank account. This proprietary GPR card allows consumers that reside in the U.S. to acquire a Cuentas Mastercard using their SSN or ITIN together with their U.S. or Foreign Passport, Driver’s License, Matricula Consular or certain U.S. residency documentation. The Cuentas Mastercard’s funds are protected in an FDIC-insured bank account at the Issuing Bank. Functionality includes ATM withdrawals, direct deposit, cash reload, fee free Cuentas App to Cuentas App fund transfers and mobile banking capabilities, among other key features such as purchasing discounted gift cards and adding “mass transit credits” to digital accounts (available in California, Connecticut, Michigan and other cities in the future). Upcoming Cuentas App upgrades should also include international remittance and other services. Consumers are able to use funds in their account to purchase third party digital and gift cards (many at discounted prices), U.S. and international mobile phone top-ups, mass transportation and tolling access (available in select markets - Connecticut, Grand Rapids, MI, Los Angeles, CA, etc.) as well as digital content for virtual gaming, dining, shopping and cash reloads.
 
The Cuentas App is available for download now on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play Store for Android. The Cuentas App allows consumers to easily activate their Cuentas Mastercard, review their account balance and conduct certain financial transactions. Cuentas offers fee free fund transfers to friends, family and vendors that have their own Cuentas App, which provides an advantage over other apps that charge fees for immediate fund transfers and availability on the same day.
 
The Cuentas Business Model
 
The Cuentas business model leverages profitability from multiple revenue sources, many of which are synergistic market segments.
 
The Cuentas Mastercard has several revenue centers. The Company will receive a one-time activation charge for each activated Cuentas Mastercard and a monthly recurring charge. These charges were designed to be very reasonable to both consumers and the Company. In addition to these charges, Cuentas will receive a commission each time funds are loaded and reloaded to the Cuentas Mastercard.
 
The Cuentas Digital Wallet produces recurring revenue and is an integral part of the Cuentas offering. It will produce revenue each time that consumers purchase third party gift cards, digital access, mass transit tickets and mobile phone top-ups (U.S. and international) with most at discounted prices. The actual discount is shown to the consumer and is immediately applied to their purchase, so smart shoppers will be able to get everyday products and services at discounted prices.
 

In 2021 the Cuentas Digital Wallet is projected to add several new, profitable, mass market services including bill pay and international remittances.
 
Cuentas also offers rewards for free long distance calling to its cardholders (“Cuentas Rewards”) who earn value with certain transactions. Our target demographic uses both internet and prepaid calling services to communicate with family members around the U.S. and in their country. This added benefit is designed, at a very low cost, to provide extra benefits to our cardholders, which should help to maintain and solidify valuable relationships with them.

Prepaid Debit Card Market Overview
 
The Research and Markets report titled “Prepaid Card Market: Payment Trends, Market Dynamics, and Forecasts 2020 - 2025” released in January 2020 states that, “[i]n the United States, prepaid cards remain the preferred choice for the unbanked market segment....” It also states that “[t]he move towards a cashless society is substantial, further driving the prepaid card market.”
Major competitors to Cuentas are Green Dot, American Express Serve, Netspend Prepaid, Starbucks Rewards, Walmart Money card and Akimbo Prepaid.
 
Cuentas is strategically positioned in the marketplace to have a lower monthly fee and lower reload fees than most cards. Additional benefits and features should move the Cuentas Mastercard ahead of other offerings as consumers realize the value of the Cuentas Digital Wallet and the Cuentas Rewards program.
The Cuentas Technology platform
 
The Cuentas technology platform is comprised of CIMA Group’s Knetik and Auris software platforms (the “CIMA Licensed Technology”). The platform is built on a powerful integrated component framework delivering a variety of capabilities accessible by a set of industry standard REST-based API endpoints. In addition to handling electronic transactions such as deposits and purchasing, the platform will have the capability of organizing virtual currencies into wallets, essentially future proofing it in today’s evolving financial environment. It enables the organizing of the user’s monetary deposits into a tree-based set of wallets, through strictly enforced user permissions, to delineate proper controls in a tiered monetary asset organizational structure, thus providing a sound basis for family and/or corporate control and distribution of funds across individuals.
 
The platform also contains a sound and proven gamification engine, capable of driving user behaviors in a manner that entices and rewards using incentivization based on proven behavioral science patterns. At the heart of this gamification engine lies a proven and robust rules engine that can easily integrate and modify process flows and orchestrations between disparate platforms, allowing for a quick and easy integration of complex, orchestrated integrations between internal process automation and invocations of external systems. The platform will provide Android and iOS software for users to execute a wide variety of transactions including, but not limited to, account balances, account transfers and in-app purchases. User messaging are also integrated and are achieved via SMS, email, in-app messaging, and voice.
 
The user management application uses rich metadata CRM and single sign-on (“SSO”) to track user behavior and personalize the user experience. It is fully integrated with our Strategic Partners, scalable and manages the digital ecosystem entitlements. The platform can process both physical and virtual goods, digital assets, real time currency value exchange, virtual currency support with current exchange rates and support nontraditional assets, in addition to credit card, POS, debits, and digital wallet management.
 
The unique rules engine is capable of all aspects of gamification: badging, questing, leveling, points consumption, leader boards, loyalty and reward points and personalization with tracking and messaging to support behavior management. Business intelligence is used for reporting and communication of product management via Rate Deck Management, Pinless ANI Recognition, IV and Call Flows and Access Number Management. The platform has redundant reporting for enhanced billing and fraud control and integrates customer service with Business Intelligence and platform integrity.

Voting Agreement
 
Contemporaneously with the CIMA Transaction Closing, on December 31, 2019, the Company, CIMA, Dinar, Arik Maimon and Michael De Prado entered into a Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, each of CIMA, Dinar and Mr. De Prado shall have the right to designate one director to the Board, and Mr. Maimon will have the right to designate two directors to the Board as promptly as practicable after the CIMA Transaction Closing. At each meeting of the Company’s shareholders at which the election of directors is to be considered, each of CIMA, Dinar, Mr. Maimon and Mr. De Prado shall have the right to designate one nominee for election at such meeting. Additionally, the Company has granted CIMA board observer rights whereby CIMA shall have the right to invite one representative to attend all meetings of the Board in a non-voting observer capacity. The size of the Board and appointee rights are subject to change in the event that the Company’s shares of Common Stock become listed on Nasdaq. Furthermore, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, each of Mr. Maimon and Mr. De Prado appointed each of CIMA and Dinar as their proxy and attorney-in-fact, with full with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote or act by written consent with respect to the shares of Voting Stock (as defined in the Voting Agreement) representing each individual’s pro rata percentage of the CIMA Proxy Stock and Dinar Proxy Stock (each as defined in the Voting Agreement), as may be recalculated from time to time subject to the terms and conditions of the Voting Agreement until the CIMA Warrant and Dinar Warrant are exercised, respectively.

This occurred on September 21, 2020 and the Pledge Agreement expired.
Side Letter Agreement
 
Contemporaneously with the CIMA Transaction Closing, the Company, Mr. Maimon, Mr. De Prado, Dinar and CIMA entered into a side letter agreement (the “CIMA Side Letter”), dated December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the CIMA Side Letter, for as long as the CIMA License Agreement is in effect, the convertible promissory note (the “CIMA Convertible Note”) is outstanding and unpaid, or CIMA is a shareholder of the Company and owns at least 5% of the Company’s Common Stock, in addition to any other vote or approval required under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or any other agreement, each as amended from time to time, the Company has agreed not to take certain actions without certain approval thresholds of the directors appointed by CIMA, Dinar, Mr. Maimon and Mr. De Prado. These negative covenants restrict, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur additional debt, alter certain employment agreements currently in place, enter into any consolidation, combination, recapitalization or reorganization transactions, and issue additional capital stock. Additionally, pursuant to the CIMA Side Letter, upon conversion of the CIMA Convertible Note by CIMA, Cuentas shall have the primary right of first refusal, and each of Dinar, Mr. De Prado and Mr. Maimon have a secondary right of first refusal, to purchase any shares of Common Stock that CIMA intends to sell to the bona fide third party purchaser on the same terms and conditions as CIMA would have sold such shares of the Common Stock to any third party purchaser.

Cuentas Mobile
 
Cuentas Mobile is our Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”), which provided NextMobile branded mobile phones and prepaid voice, text, and data mobile phone services to a customer base currently consisting of approximately 1,000 subscribers. The brand name of these services is being migrated to Cuentas Mobile. Cuentas Mobile operates this business pursuant to contracts with Sprint Corporation, which allow Cuentas Mobile to use T-Mobile’s (formerly Sprint)’s network infrastructure to operate a virtual telecommunications network providing voice, text, and data services of essentially the same quality as those Sprint provides to its own retail subscribers. MVNOs such as Cricket, Boost, Simple and Lyca Mobile have been successful at creating brands, without owning the towers, hardware or network. Cuentas is currently reactivating distribution projects through grass roots retailers that normally interact with Cuentas’ target audience, specifically offering low-cost mobile phone service with the ability to make international calls to specific Spanish speaking countries in Central and South America.

We believe that our potential customers worldwide will migrate away from legacy telephone and banking systems to enhanced mobility solutions, the Company’s technological advantage and the synergies created by its unique combination of reloadable bank card and mobile virtual network operator rights will make its products increasingly useful to unbanked, under-banked, under-served and other emerging niche markets.
 
Meimoun & Mammon LLC
 
Meimoun & Mammon LLC (“M&M”) is a retail provider of domestic and international long-distance voice, text, and data telephony services to consumers in the United States and throughout the world. M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 authority issued by the FCC. M&M operates the retail Tel3 business as a separate division.
 
M&M uses both private and public Internet services to function as the backbone of the M&M Network.
 
Regulatory Compliance
 
We operate in an ever-evolving and complex legal and regulatory environment. We, the products and services that we offer and market, and those for which we provide processing services, are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: federal communications laws and regulations; foreign jurisdiction communications laws and regulations; federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Patriot Act, the BSA, anti-terrorist financing laws and anti-bribery and corrupt practice laws and regulations in the U.S., and similar international laws and regulations, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act in Canada; state unclaimed property laws and money transmitter or similar licensing requirements; federal and state consumer protection laws, including the CARD Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulations relating to privacy and data security; and foreign jurisdiction payment services industry regulations.
 
Our subsidiaries Cuentas Mobile and M&M are subject to regulation by the FCC and other government agencies and task forces. M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 licenses issued by the FCC, which may be suspended or revoked by the FCC if M&M does not strictly comply with all applicable regulations and the terms and conditions under which the International and Domestic Section 214 licenses were issued. Cuentas Mobile and M&M are also subject to foreign jurisdiction communications laws and regulations. We believe that we, including our subsidiaries, are currently operating in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but there is no certainty that laws and regulations affecting our business will not change. Any such change of laws and regulations applicable to our business might adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and achieve profitable operating results.
 
At the federal level, Congress and federal regulatory agencies have enacted and implemented new laws and regulations that affect the prepaid industry, such the CARD Act and FinCEN’s Prepaid Access Rule. Moreover, there are currently proposals before Congress that could further substantially change the way banks, including prepaid card issuing banks and other financial services companies, are regulated and are permitted to offer their products to consumers. Non-bank financial services companies, including money transmitters and prepaid access providers, are now regulated at the federal level by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which began operations in July 2011, bringing additional uncertainty to the regulatory system and its impact on our business. We are increasingly facing more stringent anti-money laundering rules and regulations, compliance with which may increase our costs of operation, decrease our operating revenues and disrupt our business. Abuse of our prepaid products for purposes of financing sanctioned countries, terrorist funding, bribery or corruption could cause reputational or other harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with, or further expansion of, consumer protection regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure by us to comply with federal banking regulation may subject us to fines and penalties and our relationships with our issuing banks may be harmed.
 
Most states regulate the business of sellers of traveler’s checks, money orders, drafts and other monetary instruments, which we refer to collectively as money transmitters. While many states expressly exempt banks and their agents from regulation as money transmitters, others purport to regulate the money transmittal businesses of bank agents or do not extend exemptions to non-branch bank agents. In those states where we are required to be licensed, we are subject to direct supervision and regulation by the relevant state banking departments or similar agencies charged with enforcement of the money transmitter statutes and must comply with various restrictions and requirements, such as those related to the maintenance of certain levels of net worth, surety bonding, selection and oversight of our authorized delegates, permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations with respect to some of the products subject to licensure, recordkeeping and reporting, and disclosures to consumers. We are also subject to periodic examinations by the relevant licensing authorities, which may include reviews of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, various agreements that we have with our issuing banks, retail distribution partners and other third parties, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to our business. As a regulated entity, Cuentas may incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance. We anticipate that compliance costs and requirements will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries and that additional subsidiaries will need to become subject to these or new regulations. If we fail to maintain our existing money transmitter licenses or permits, or fail to obtain new licenses or permits in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Recent Developments
 
COVID-19
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. A significant outbreak of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, as well as our business and operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Entry into and Repayment of a Short-Term Loan with Labrys Funds LP
 
On September 2, 2020, the Company issued the Labrys Note to Labrys Funds LP (“Labrys”). The Labrys Note bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and was to mature on September 2, 2021. An amortized, monthly payment of principal and interest in the sum of $67,760 started in December 2020, with ability to extend the starting date of such amortized payments for up to two months upon notice, and the remaining loan principal becomes payable on maturity. The Labrys Note had an original issue discount in the amount of $60,500, and the issuing expenses were $40,000, resulting in net proceeds of $505,000. The Company also issued 70,906 shares of its Common Stock to Labrys. Out of those, 16,500 shares of Common Stock were issued in consideration of a commitment fee and the balance are subject to return to the Company once the Labrys Note is paid in full, if there were no defaults. In the event of a default, as defined in the Labrys Note, Labrys would have the right, to convert all or any portion of the then outstanding and unpaid principal amount and interest into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the date of the Labrys Note, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company into which such Common Stock shall be changed or reclassified, at the conversion price as set forth in the Labrys Note. On February 12, 2021, the Company prepaid its loan to Labrys and Labrys returned the Second Commitment shares to the Company.
