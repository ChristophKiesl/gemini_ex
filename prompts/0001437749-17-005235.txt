OVERVIEW
 
Celsion is a fully-integrated, development stage oncology drug company focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy and RNA based therapies. Our lead product candidate is ThermoDox®, a proprietary dosage form of doxorubicin based on a heat-activated liposomal platform technology, currently in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), also known as primary liver cancer, and a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer. Our pipeline also includes GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy currently in a Phase I clinical trial for the localized treatment of ovarian cancer and pre-clinical development for brain cancer. GEN-1 is based on a platform technology for the development of treatments using novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies. We are working to develop and commercialize more efficient, effective and targeted oncology therapies based on our technologies, with the goal of developing novel therapeutics that maximize efficacy while minimizing side-effects common to cancer treatments.
 
ThermoDox®

ThermoDox® is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial, in combination with a standardized radiofrequency ablation (“RFA”), for primary liver cancer (the “OPTIMA Study”) and a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the “DIGNITY Study”). ThermoDox® is a heat sensitive liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, an approved and frequently used oncology drug for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Localized heat at hyperthermia temperatures (greater than 40 degrees Celsius) releases the encapsulated doxorubicin from the liposome enabling high concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in and around the targeted tumor.
 
The OPTIMA Study. The OPTIMA Study represents an evaluation of ThermoDox® in combination with a first line therapy, RFA, for newly diagnosed, intermediate stage HCC patients. HCC incidence globally is approximately 850,000 new cases per year and is the third largest cancer indication globally. Approximately 30% of newly diagnosed patients can be addressed with RFA alone. 
 
On February 24, 2014, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), after its customary 30-day review period, provided clearance for the OPTIMA Study, which is a pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox®, in combination with standardized RFA, for the treatment of primary liver cancer. The trial design of the OPTIMA Study is based on the comprehensive analysis of data from an earlier clinical trial called the HEAT Study (the “HEAT Study”), which is described below. The OPTIMA Study is supported by a hypothesis developed from an overall survival analysis of a large subgroup of patients from the HEAT Study.
 
We initiated the OPTIMA Study in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study was designed with extensive input from globally recognized hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) researchers and expert clinicians and after receiving formal written consultation from the FDA. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 65 sites in the U.S., Canada, European Union, China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox® in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions three to seven centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial is overall survival (“OS”), and the secondary endpoints are progression free survival and safety. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent Data Monitoring Committee.
 
On December 16, 2015, we announced that we had received the clinical trial application approval from the China Food and Drug Administration (the “CFDA”) to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. This clinical trial application approval will allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study during the first half of 2018. On April 26, 2016, we announced that the first patient in China had been enrolled in the OPTIMA Study. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval.
 
Post-hoc data analysis from the Company’s earlier Phase III HEAT Study suggest that ThermoDox® may substantially improve OS, when compared to the control group, in patients if their lesions undergo a 45 minute RFA procedure standardized for a lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter. Data from nine OS sweeps have been conducted since the top line progression free survival (“PFS”) data from the HEAT Study were announced in January 2013, with each data set demonstrating substantial improvement in clinical benefit over the control group with statistical significance. On August 15, 2016, the Company announced updated results from its final retrospective OS analysis of the data from the HEAT Study. These results demonstrated that in a large, well bounded, subgroup of patients with a single lesion (n=285, 41% of the HEAT Study patients), treatment with a combination of ThermoDox® and optimized RFA provided an average 54% risk improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio (“HR”) at this analysis is 0.65 (95% CI 0.45 - 0.94) with a p-value of 0.02. Median OS for the ThermoDox® group has been reached which translates into a two year survival benefit over the optimized RFA group (projected to be greater than 80 months for the ThermoDox® plus optimized RFA group compared to less than 60 months projection for the optimized RFA only group).

Additional findings from this most recent analysis specific to the Chinese patient cohort of 223 patients are summarized below:
 

● | In the population of 154 patients with a single lesion who received optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more showed a 53% risk improvement in OS (HR = 0.66) when treated with ThermoDox® plus optimized RFA. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | These data continue to support and further strengthen ThermoDox®’s potential to significantly improve OS compared to an RFA control in patients with lesions that undergo optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more. The clinical benefit seen in the intent-to-treat Chinese patient cohort further confirms the importance of RFA heating time as 72% of patients in this large patient cohort in China received an optimized RFA treatment.

 
While this information should be viewed with caution since it is based on a retrospective analysis of a subgroup, we also conducted additional analyses that further strengthen the evidence for the HEAT Study sub-group. We commissioned an independent computational model at the University of South Carolina Medical School. The results unequivocally indicate that longer RFA heating times correlate with significant increases in doxorubicin concentration around the RFA treated tissue. In addition, we conducted a prospective preclinical study in 21 pigs using two different manufacturers of RFA and human equivalent doses of ThermoDox® that clearly support the relationship between increased heating duration and doxorubicin concentrations.
 
On November 29, 2016, the Company announced the results of an independent analysis conducted by the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”) from the HEAT Study which reaffirmed the correlation between increased RFA burn time per tumor volume and improvements in overall survival. The NIH analysis, which sought to evaluate the correlation between RFA burn time per tumor volume (min/ml) and clinical outcome, concluded that increased burn time per tumor volume significantly improved overall survival in patients treated with RFA plus ThermoDox® compared to patients treated with RFA alone.
 
The HEAT Study. On January 31, 2013, the Company announced that the HEAT Study, ThermoDox® in combination with RFA, did not meet the primary endpoint, PFS, of a Phase III clinical trial enrolling 701 patients with primary liver cancer. This determination was made after conferring with the HEAT Study independent Data Monitoring Committee, that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival. In the trial, ThermoDox® was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. Following the announcement of the HEAT Study results, we continued to follow patients for OS, the secondary endpoint of the HEAT Study. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data from the HEAT Study to assess the future strategic value and development strategy for ThermoDox®.
 
The DIGNITY Study. On December 14, 2015, we announced final data from our ongoing DIGNITY study, which is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase II trial of ThermoDox® in patients with recurrent chest wall (“RCW”) breast cancer. The DIGNITY Study was designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and to demonstrate local control in Phase II, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint. The DIGNITY Study was also designed to evaluate kinetics in ThermoDox® produced from more than one manufacturing site. Of the 28 patients enrolled and treated, 21 patients were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Approximately 62% of evaluable patients experienced a local response, including six complete responses and seven partial responses.
 
The Euro-DIGNITY Study. We anticipate that a Phase II study of RadioTherapy, HyperThermia and ThermoDox® to treat patients with local-regional recurrent chest wall breast cancer will be initiated by five to six clinical sites located in Italy, Israel, Poland and the Czech Republic (the “Euro-DIGNITY Study”). The Euro-DIGNITY Study is expected to commence in 2017 and is expected to enroll up to 70 patients affected by recurrent breast adenocarcinoma on the chest wall with/without nodes over a period of two years.
 
The primary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate efficacy in patients after 3 cycles of ThermoDox® plus Hyperthermia measuring tumor diameter as a response to therapy and (ii) to evaluate loco-regional breast tumor control in patients who undergo ThermoDox®/hyperthermia/radiotherapy as measured by target lesion clinical response rate combining a RECIST criteria with digital photography to gauge response.

Secondary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate the safety of the combination of ThermoDox®/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with local-regional recurrence (“LRR”) breast cancer, (ii) to evaluate the duration of local control complete response, partial response and stable disease following treatment with ThermoDox®/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy up to 24 months among patients with LRR breast cancer and (iii) to assess Patient Reported Quality of Life using the FACT-B and Brief Pain Inventory following treatment with ThermoDox®/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with LRR breast cancer.
 
Acquisition of EGEN Assets

On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Egen, Inc., an Alabama corporation, which has changed its company name to EGWU, Inc. after the closing of the acquisition (“EGEN”), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of June 6, 2014, by and between EGEN and Celsion (the Asset Purchase Agreement). We acquired all of EGEN’s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date.
 
The total purchase price for the asset acquisition is up to $44.4 million, including potential future earnout payments of up to $30.4 million contingent upon achievement of certain earnout milestones set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. At the closing, we paid approximately $3.0 million in cash after the expense adjustment and issued 2,712,188 shares of our common stock to EGEN. The shares of common stock were issued in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. In addition, 670,070 shares of common stock were held back by us at the closing and are issuable to EGEN pending certain potential adjustments for expenses or in relation to EGEN’s indemnification obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
The earnout payments of up to $30.4 million will become payable, in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our option, upon achievement of three major milestone events as follows:
 

● | $12.4 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to an ovarian cancer study of GEN-1 (formerly known as EGEN-001) to be conducted by us or our subsidiary;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | $12.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to a GEN-1 glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer study to be conducted by us or our subsidiary; and 
● | up to $6.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified milestones relating to the TheraSilence technology acquired from EGEN in the acquisition. 

 
Our obligations to make the earnout payments will terminate on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. In the acquisition, we purchased GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers, and two platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas and TheraSilence.
 
GEN-1

GEN-1 is a DNA-based immunotherapeutic product for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers by intraperitoneally administering an Interleukin-12 (“IL-12”) plasmid formulated with our proprietary TheraPlas delivery system. In this DNA-based approach, the immunotherapy is combined with a standard chemotherapy drug, which can potentially achieve better clinical outcomes than with chemotherapy alone. We believe that increases in IL-12 concentrations at tumor sites for several days after a single administration could create a potent immune environment against tumor activity and that a direct killing of the tumor with concomitant use of cytotoxic chemotherapy could result in a more robust and durable antitumor response than chemotherapy alone.

GEN-1 OVATION Study. In February 2015, we announced that the FDA accepted, without objection, the Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the “OVATION Study”). On September 30, 2015, we announced enrollment of the first patient in the OVATION Study. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and potentially therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response and is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose level and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin® and Doxil®. In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affect ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patients’ immune system, including:
 

● | infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and 
● | expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue. 

 
We have initiated the OVATION Study at four clinical sites at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. During 2016 and 2017, we announced data from the first four cohorts of patients in the OVATION Study, respectively. The first four cohorts each enrolled three patients. Enrollment of three additional patients in the fourth cohort is ongoing, and Celsion expects to complete the OVATION Study in the first half of 2017. Future studies of GEN-1 may include a Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin® and Doxil®. The results of the OVATION Study to date are as follows:
 
Totality of Results in the First Four Cohorts
 

● | Of the first twelve patients dosed, one (1) patient demonstrated a complete response (“CR”), eight (8) patients demonstrated partial response (“PR”) and three patients demonstrated stable disease (“SD”), as measured by RECIST criteria. This translates to a 100% disease control rate (“DCR”) and 75% objective response rate (“ORR”). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Eleven patients had successful resections of their tumors, with six (6) patients having an R0 resection, which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed, and four (4) patients with a R1 resection, indicating microscopic residual tumor. One patient had an R2, indicating macroscopic residual tumor. One patient in the second cohort was ineligible for debulking surgery due to a medical complication unrelated to the study or the study drug. 
● | Of the eleven surgically treated and evaluable patients, one patient demonstrated a complete pathological response (“cPR”), five (5) patients demonstrated a micro pathological response (“microPR”), and five (5) patients demonstrated a macroPR. These data compare favorably to historical data, which indicate that cPRs are typically seen in less than 7% of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. cPRs have been associated with a median overall survival of 72 months, which is more than three years longer than those who do not experience a cPR. In addition, microPRs are seen in approximately 30% of patients, and are associated with a median overall survival of 38 months.
● | All eleven patients who completed treatment follow-up experienced a dramatic (greater than 90%) drop in their CA-125 protein levels as of their most recent study visit. CA-125 is used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment. CA-125 is present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A 50% reduction in CA-125 levels is considered meaningful.

 Top Line Translational Data from First Two Cohorts
 
Celsion also reported initial translational data from the first two cohorts of patients. Tumor and blood samples collected before the start of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (“NACT”) and after the completion of GEN-1 treatment at debulking surgery are being analyzed for immune cell populations.  Top line data demonstrates intriguing immunological changes in the tumor that are consistent with the activation of the immune system. Specifically,

● | In tumor tissue, there was an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell density in three out of four evaluable patients at debulking surgery. There was a decrease in immunosuppressive FoxP3+ T-cells in two out of those 4 patients. The ratio of CD8+/FoxP3+ cells was increased in all four evaluable patients. High tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell density, low FoxP3+ T-cell density or high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio demonstrate a potential shift in tumor environment to favoring immune stimulation following NACT + GEN-1 therapy. For the remaining two patients the post-treatment tumor tissue was not available. In one of those two patients there was complete pathological response hence no tumor tissue was present to provide a post-treatment comparison. In the other patient the debulking surgery was not performed due to disease related complications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In plasma samples, there was no significant change in T-cell density following the treatment. The density of myeloid derived suppressor cells that are associated with immunosuppression in ovarian cancer were either decreased or did not increase in post-treatment samples. 

 
Additional immune analysis of biological tissue including cytokine ELISA from the first two patient cohorts and a complete analysis of the two higher dose cohorts is in progress. We expect to report the final clinical and translational data from the OVATION Study in mid-2017.
 
GEN-1 Plus Doxil® and Avastin® Trial. On April 29, 2015, we announced the expansion of our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial to evaluate GEN-1 in combination with Avastin® and Doxil® in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin® may result in significant clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile. Specifically:
 

● | In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin® led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin® (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin® treatment alone. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments of GEN-1 and Avastin®. The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin® may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 
● | The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin® (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) also suggests scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma (“IFN-g”) pathway may help to explain the synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin® and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin® therapy.

 
TheraPlas Technology Platform. TheraPlas is a technology platform for the delivery of DNA and messenger RNA (“mRNA”) therapeutics via synthetic non-viral carriers and is capable of providing cell transfection for double-stranded DNA plasmids and large therapeutic RNA segments such as mRNA. There are two components of the TheraPlas system, a plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding a therapeutic protein and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation and promote trafficking into cells and through intracellular compartments. We designed the delivery system of TheraPlas by chemically modifying the low molecular weight polymer to improve its gene transfer activity without increasing toxicity. We believe TheraPlas is a viable alternative to current approaches to gene delivery due to several distinguishing characteristics, including enhanced molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety.
 
Technology Development and Licensing Agreements. Our current efforts and resources are applied on the development and commercialization of cancer drugs including tumor-targeting chemotherapy treatments using focused heat energy in combination with heat-activated drug delivery systems, immunotherapies and RNA-based therapies. To support our research and development, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $127.2 million in equity financings and warrant and option exercises in the years 2010 through 2015. During 2016, we raised gross proceeds of $7.8 million through two registered direct equity financings with several institutional investors. We had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and interest receivable totaling $4.3 million at December 31, 2016. We have one credit facility for a total principle amount of up to $20 million and have drawn down $10 million under this credit facility.

In June 2012, Celsion and Zhejiand Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (“Hisun”) signed a long-term commercial supply agreement for the production of ThermoDox®. Hisun is one the largest manufacturers of chemotherapy agents globally, including doxorubicin. In July 2013, the ThermoDox® collaboration was expanded to focus on next generation liposomal formulation development with the goal of creating safer, more efficacious versions of marketed cancer chemotherapeutics. During 2015, Hisun successfully completed the manufacture of three registration batches for ThermoDox® and has obtained regulatory approvals to supply ThermoDox® to participating clinical trial sites in all of the countries of South East Asia, Europe and North America, as well as to the European Union countries allowing for early access to ThermoDox®. The future manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies by Hisun will result in a cost structure allowing Celsion to profitably access all global markets, including third world countries, and help accelerate the Company’s product development program in China for ThermoDox® in primary liver cancer and other approved indications.
 
On August 8, 2016, we signed a Technology Transfer, Manufacturing and Commercial Supply Agreement (the “GEN-1 Agreement”) with Hisun to pursue an expanded partnership for the technology transfer relating to the clinical and commercial manufacture and supply of GEN-1, for the greater China territory, with the option to expand into other countries in the rest of the world after all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. The GEN-1 Agreement will help to support supply for both ongoing and planned clinical studies in the U.S., and for potential future studies of GEN-1 in China. GEN-1 is currently being evaluated by Celsion in first line ovarian cancer patients.
 
Key provisions of the GEN-1 Agreement are as follows:
 

● | the GEN-1 Agreement has targeted unit costs for clinical supplies of GEN-1 that are substantially competitive with the Company’s current suppliers; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | once approved, the cost structure for GEN-1 will support rapid market adoption and significant gross margins across global markets; 
● | Celsion will provide Hisun a certain percentage of China’s commercial unit demand, and separately of global commercial unit demand, subject to regulatory approval; 
● | Hisun and Celsion will commence technology transfer activities relating to the manufacture of GEN-1, including all studies required by CFDA for site approval; and 
● | Hisun will collaborate with Celsion around the regulatory approval activities for GEN-1 with the CFDA. A local China partner affords Celsion access to accelerated CFDA review and potential regulatory exclusivity for the approved indication.

 
As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research, development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or if we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialize approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.

THERMODOX® (DOXORUBICIN ENCAPSULATED IN HEAT-ACTIVATED LIPOSOME)
 
Liposomes are manufactured submicroscopic vesicles consisting of a discrete aqueous central compartment surrounded by a membrane bilayer composed of naturally occurring lipids. Conventional liposomes have been designed and manufactured to carry drugs and increase residence time, thus allowing the drugs to remain in the bloodstream for extended periods of time before they are removed from the body. However, the current existing liposomal formulations of cancer drugs and liposomal cancer drugs under development do not provide for the immediate release of the drug and the direct targeting of organ specific tumors, two important characteristics that are required for improving the efficacy of cancer drugs such as doxorubicin. A team of research scientists at Duke University developed a heat-sensitive liposome that rapidly changes its structure when heated to a threshold minimum temperature of 39.5º to 42º Celsius.  Heating creates channels in the liposome bilayer that allow an encapsulated drug to rapidly disperse into the surrounding tissue. Through a perpetual, world-wide, exclusive development and commercialization license from Duke University, Celsion has licensed this novel, heat-activated liposomal technology that is differentiated from other liposomes through its unique low heat-activated release of encapsulated chemotherapeutic agents.   
 
We are using several available focused-heat technologies, such as radio frequency ablation (RFA), microwave energy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), to activate the release of drugs from our novel heat sensitive liposomes.  
 
THERMODOX® IN RELATION TO PRIMARY LIVER CANCER
 
Liver Cancer Overview
 
Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) is one of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide.  It ranks as the third most common solid tumor cancer.  It is estimated that up to 90% of liver cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis. The incidence of primary liver cancer is approximately 30,000 cases per year in the U.S., approximately 40,000 cases per year in Europe and is rapidly growing worldwide at approximately 850,000 cases per year.  HCC has the fastest rate of growth of all cancers and is projected to be the most prevalent form of cancer by 2020. HCC is commonly diagnosed in patients with longstanding hepatic disease and cirrhosis (primarily due to hepatitis C in the U.S. and Europe and hepatitis B in Asia).
 
At an early stage, the standard first line treatment for liver cancer is surgical resection of the tumor.  Up to 80% of patients are ineligible for surgery or transplantation at time of diagnosis because early stage liver cancer generally has few symptoms and when finally detected the tumor frequently is too large for surgical resection. There are few alternative treatments, since radiation therapy and chemotherapy are largely ineffective in treating liver cancer. For tumors generally up to 5 centimeters in diameter, RFA has emerged as the standard of care treatment which directly destroys the tumor tissue through the application of high temperatures administered by a probe inserted into the core of the tumor. Local recurrence rates after RFA directly correlate to the size of the tumor. For tumors 3 cm or smaller in diameter the recurrence rate has been reported to be 10 – 20%; however, for tumors greater than 3 cm, local recurrence rates of 40% or higher have been observed.
 
Celsion’s Approach
 
While RFA uses extremely high temperatures (greater than 80° Celsius) to ablate the tumor, it may fail to treat micro-metastases in the outer margins of the ablation zone because temperatures in the periphery may not be high enough to destroy cancer cells. Celsion’s ThermoDox® treatment approach is designed to utilize the ability of RFA devices to ablate the center of the tumor while simultaneously thermally activating our ThermoDox® liposome to release its encapsulated doxorubicin to kill remaining viable cancer cells throughout the heated region, including the tumor ablation margins. This novel treatment approach is intended to deliver the drug directly to those cancer cells that survive RFA. This approach is designed to increase the delivery of the doxorubicin at the desired tumor site while potentially reducing drug exposure distant to the tumor site. 
Phase I Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer
 
In the second quarter of 2007, we completed our first Phase I single dose escalation clinical trial that investigated ThermoDox® in combination with RFA for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer. The study was carried out at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong.
 
In 2007 we initiated a second Phase I dose escalation study designed to investigate simplification of the current RFA/ThermoDox® treatment regimen including a single vial formulation of ThermoDox® designed for commercial distribution. The study also permitted multiple dosing in liver cancer patients. This clinical trial was completed in 2008.

701 Patient Phase III Global Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer (The HEAT Study)
 
The HEAT Study for ThermoDox®, in combination with RFA, was conducted in patients with primary liver cancer under a Special Protocol Assessment agreed to with the FDA. The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreed to with the FDA specified PFS as the HEAT Study’s primary endpoint. We scheduled a meeting with the HEAT Study independent Data Monitoring Committee (“iDMC”) on January 30, 2013 in order to conduct an analysis of the HEAT Study’s PFS endpoint. Following review by the iDMC, on January 31, 2013, we announced that ThermoDox® in combination with RFA did not meet the HEAT Study’s primary endpoint of PFS. Specifically, we determined, after conferring with the iDMC, that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness that could form the basis for regulatory approval in the population chosen for the HEAT Study. The HEAT Study was designed to show a 33 percent improvement in PFS with 80 percent power and a p-value = 0.05. In the trial, ThermoDox® was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. 
 
As provided for in the SPA, we continued to follow patients enrolled in the HEAT Study to the secondary endpoint of Overall Survival (OS). We have evaluated data from nine sweeps of OS since the announcement of the HEAT Study’s primary endpoint result, with each showing progressive improvement in statistical significance. The most recent post-hoc OS analysis from the HEAT Study (as of July 15, 2016 and announced on August 15, 2016) demonstrated that in a large, well bounded subgroup of patients (n=285, 41% of the study patients), the combination of ThermoDox® and optimized RFA provided a 54% risk improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio at this latest OS analysis is 0.65 (95% CI 0.45 - 0.94) with a p-value of 0.02. Median OS for the ThermoDox® group has been reached which translates into a two year survival benefit over the optimized RFA group (projected to be greater than 80 months for the ThermoDox® plus optimized RFA group compared to less than 60 months projection for the optimized RFA only group). These data continue to strongly suggest that ThermoDox® may significantly improve OS compared to a RFA control in patients whose lesions undergo optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more as well as support the protocol for our Phase III OPTIMA Study as described below.
 
While this information should be viewed with caution since it is based on a retrospective analysis of a subgroup, we also conducted additional analyses that may further strengthen the evidence for the HEAT Study sub-group. We commissioned an independent computational model at the University of South Carolina Medical School. The results unequivocally indicate that longer RFA heating times correlate with significant increases in doxorubicin concentration around the RFA treated tissue. In addition, we conducted a prospective preclinical study in 21 pigs using two different manufacturers of RFA and human equivalent doses of ThermoDox® that clearly support the relationship between increased heating duration and doxorubicin concentrations.
 
550 Patient Phase III Global Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer (The OPTIMA Study)
 
Based on the OS data from the post-hoc analysis of results from the HEAT Study discussed above, we submitted our proposed pivotal Phase III clinical protocol for FDA review in the fourth quarter of 2013. On February 24, 2014, we announced that the FDA, after its customary 30 day review period, accepted without comment, subject to compliance with regulatory standards, clearance for the OPTIMA Study, our pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox® in combination with standardized RFA in primary liver cancer. The OPTIMA Study represents an evaluation of ThermoDox® in combination with a first line therapy, RFA, for newly diagnosed, intermediate stage HCC patients. HCC incidence globally is approximately 800,000 new cases per year. Approximately only 30% of newly diagnosed patients can be addressed with RFA alone. The OPTIMA Study is supported with a convincing hypothesis developed from an overall survival analysis of a large subgroup of patients from the HEAT Study.
 
Designed with extensive input from globally recognized HCC researchers and clinicians and after formal written consultation with the FDA, the OPTIMA Study was launched in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 75 sites in the U.S., Canada, European Union, China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox® in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions 3 to 7 centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for the trial is Overall Survival, and the secondary endpoints for the trial are PFS and safety. The OPTIMA Study is 80% powered to show a 33% improvement in OS. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent iDMC.

On December 16, 2015, we announced that we had received the clinical trial application approval from the CFDA to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. This clinical trial application approval will now allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study during the first half of 2018. On April 26, 2016, we announced that the first patient in China has been enrolled in the OPTIMA Study. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval.
 
On November 29, 2016, the Company announced the results of an independent analysis conducted by the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”) from the HEAT Study which reaffirmed the correlation between increased RFA burn time per tumor volume and improvements in overall survival. The NIH analysis, which sought to evaluate the correlation between RFA burn time per tumor volume (min/ml) and clinical outcome, concluded that increased burn time per tumor volume significantly improved overall survival in patients treated with RFA plus ThermoDox® compared to patients treated with RFA alone.
 
We will continue with partnerships, such as our arrangement with Hisun and Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd. (“Yakult”) to the extent feasible. In addition, we have assessed our product pipeline and research and development priorities. As we evaluate strategic alternatives, we will need to consider a number of factors, including investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies or products, possible capital raising transactions, partnering opportunities and working capital requirements. However, as demonstrated by the HEAT Study results announced on January 31, 2013, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results is extremely difficult to predict. Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition and market value. 
 
THERMODOX® IN RELATION TO CANCERS OTHER THAN PRIMARY LIVER CANCER
 
Recurrent Chest Wall (RCW) Breast Cancer Overview
 
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in both the U.S. and the world. Despite a variety of therapeutic approaches, up to 40% of the estimated 95,000 patients in the U.S. undergoing a mastectomy as their primary treatment will develop locally recurrent RCW breast cancer.  There is currently no effective chemotherapeutic standard of care for RCW breast cancer and as a result, many of these patients will die within two years of the recurrence. Patients with RCW breast cancer suffer from disfiguring tumors and other symptoms including pain, foul-smelling wounds, and a very visual reminder of tumor progression.
Celsion’s Approach
 
We have been actively seeking a targeted localized treatment for breast cancer using ThermoDox® in conjunction with localized microwave hyperthermia to treat RCW breast cancer. Studies at Duke University and other centers have indicated that heat may improve the therapeutic action of non-temperature sensitive liposomal doxorubicin formulations in advanced loco-regional breast cancer. Our liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin is released by heat generated from an external microwave tissue hyperthermia device that is placed on a woman’s chest. The microwave hyperthermia heats the target to a temperature adequate to activate ThermoDox® but not to ablate the tissue like RFA. Upon heating to 39.5º to 42º C, a significant concentration of doxorubicin is released directly to the tumor. As in our liver cancer program, we use a commercially available thermotherapy device to heat the target tissue and activate ThermoDox® at the desired target site.
 
Microwave hyperthermia as a separate standalone treatment has been found to have the ability to kill breast cancer cells.  Because breast cancer cells have higher water content than surrounding normal cells, the tumor is heated to a greater extent than normal breast tissue and is selectively destroyed.  Therefore, heating cancer cells with a microwave device for sixty minutes at 43°C has been found to be tumoricidal. We expect that the combination of microwave hyperthermia and ThermoDox® will be more efficacious than microwave hyperthermia alone or treatment with existing non-heat activated liposomal formulations.
 
Breast Cancer Phase I/II Clinical Trial - The DIGNITY Study
 
In 2009, the Company commenced an open label, dose-escalating ThermoDox® Phase I/Phase II clinical trial for patients with RCW breast cancer – (the DIGNITY Study). The DIGNITY Study is designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and in Phase II to demonstrate local control, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint.  The DIGNITY Study is also planned to evaluate kinetics in ThermoDox® produced from more than one manufacturing site.
 
 
10



The Company completed enrollment of the Phase I portion of the study in 2010. The enrollment of the Phase II portion of the DIGNITY Study commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and completed in mid-2015. The trial evaluated ThermoDox® in combination with mild hyperthermia and enrolled 28 patients at five clinical sites in the U.S. in both phases of the study. On December 14, 2015, we announced final data from the DIGNITY Study of ThermoDox® in RCW Breast Cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Of the 28 patients enrolled and treated, 21 patients were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Thirteen patients, representing approximately 62% of the evaluable patients, experienced a local response, including six complete responses and seven partial responses. These data are consistent with the combined clinical data from the two previous Phase I trials discussed below.
 
Duke University also conducted a Phase I dose escalating ThermoDox® study in patients with RCW breast cancer and has presented preliminary results from the 16 enrolled patients that characterize the safety of the drug in RCW patients and the feasibility of ThermoDox® administration in these patients. In December 2013, we announced combined clinical data from our DIGNITY study and the Duke University sponsored Phase I trial of ThermoDox® plus hyperthermia in RCW breast cancer. The two similarly designed Phase I studies enrolled patients with highly resistant tumors found on the chest wall and who had progressed on previous therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy. ThermoDox® in combination with mild hyperthermia was evaluated in these patients in up to six cycles. Both studies employed an open label 3+3 dose escalation study design to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose, evaluate safety and determine early effects of ThermoDox® in combination with mild hyperthermia. There were 29 patients treated in the two trials, including 11 patients in the DIGNITY Study and 18 patients in the Duke study. Of the 29 patients, 23 were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. A local response rate of over 60 percent was reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients with five complete responses and nine partial responses.
 
Breast Cancer Phase II Clinical Trial - The Euro-DIGNITY Study
 
The Company anticipates that a Phase II study of RadioTherapy, HyperThermia and ThermoDox® to treat patients with local-regional recurrent chest wall breast cancer will be initiated by five to six clinical sites located in Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic (the Euro-DIGNITY Study). The Euro-DIGNITY Study is expected to commence in 2017 and is expected to enroll up to 70 patients affected by recurrent breast adenocarcinoma on the chest wall with/without nodes over a period of two years. 
 
The primary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate efficacy in patients after 3 cycles of ThermoDox® plus Hyperthermia measuring tumor diameter as a response to therapy and (ii) to evaluate loco-regional breast tumor control in patients who undergo ThermoDox®/hyperthermia/radiotherapy as measured by target lesion clinical response rate combining a RECIST criteria with digital photography to gauge response. 
 
Secondary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate the safety of the combination of ThermoDox®/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with local-regional recurrence (LRR) breast cancer, (ii) to evaluate the duration of local control complete response, partial response and stable disease following treatment with ThermoDox®/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy up to 24 months among patients with LRR breast cancer and (iii) to assess Patient Reported Quality of Life using the FACT-B and Brief Pain Inventory following treatment with ThermoDox®/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with LRR breast cancer.

Ovarian Cancer Overview
 
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecological malignancies among women with an overall five year survival rate of 45%. This poor outcome is due in part to the lack of effective prevention and early detection strategies. There were approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in the U.S. in 2014 with an estimated 14,000 deaths. Mortality rates for ovarian cancer declined very little in the last forty years due to the unavailability of detection tests and improved treatments. Most women with ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until Stages III or IV, when the disease has spread outside the pelvis to the abdomen and areas beyond causing swelling and pain, where the five-year survival rates are 25 to 41 percent and 11 percent, respectively. First-line chemotherapy regimens are typically platinum-based combination therapies. Although this first line of treatment has an approximate 80 percent response rate, 55 to 75 percent of women will develop recurrent ovarian cancer within two years and ultimately will not respond to platinum therapy. Patients whose cancer recurs or progresses after initially responding to surgery and first-line chemotherapy have been divided into one of the two groups based on the time from completion of platinum therapy to disease recurrence or progression. This time period is referred to as platinum-free interval. The platinum-sensitive group has a platinum-free interval of longer than six months. This group generally responds to additional treatment with platinum-based therapies. The platinum-resistant group has a platinum-free interval of shorter than six months and is resistant to additional platinum-based treatments. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, and Avastin are the only approved second-line therapies for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The overall response rate for these therapies is 10 to 20 percent with median overall survival of eleven to twelve months. Immunotherapy is an attractive novel approach for the treatment of ovarian cancer particularly since ovarian cancers are considered immunogenic tumors. IL-12 is one of the most active cytokines for the induction of potent anti-cancer immunity acting through the induction of T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation. The precedence for a therapeutic role of IL-12 in ovarian cancer is based on epidemiologic and preclinical data. 
Celsion’s Approach
 
Celsion’s GEN-1 approach for IL-12 delivery is designed to achieve local concentrations of IL-12 at the tumor site with minimal increases in systemic circulation. This DNA-based approach involves intraperitoneal administration of an IL-12 plasmid formulated with a proprietary lipopolymer delivery system PEG-PEI-Cholesterol. In this approach, our GEN-1 immunotherapy is combined with standard chemotherapy drugs to achieve better clinical outcome than with chemotherapy alone. Increases in IL-12 concentrations at the tumor site for several days (up to one week) after a single administration will create a potent immune environment against the tumor and a direct killing of the tumor with concomitant use of cytotoxic chemotherapy together will result in more robust and durable antitumor response than chemotherapy alone. The activation of the body’s immune system will potentially eliminate the chemotherapy resistant cells and lower the risk of recurrence. 
 
GEN-1 OVATION Study
 
We have initiated a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION Study) at four clinical sites, including the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients who will be undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of their tumors. The trial is expected to enroll three to six patients per dose level and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin® and Doxil®.  In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affects ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patient’s immune system, including:
 

● | infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
12



These extensive mechanistic studies will assist in the design of novel combination approaches with immunotherapies and other anti-cancer agents driven by potential synergistic action mechanisms, and define an enhanced patient population based on molecular characteristics inherent to tumor tissue or the immune system.  
 
In 2016 and early 2017, we announced data from the first four cohorts of patients in the OVATION Study. The OVATION Study is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose cohort and will continue into 2017 with the goal to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response. The first four cohorts each enrolled three patients. Enrollment of three additional patients in the fourth cohort is ongoing, and Celsion expects to complete the OVATION Study in the first half of 2017. Future studies of GEN-1 will include a Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin® and Doxil®. The results of the OVATION Study to date are as follows:
 
Totality of Results in the First Four Cohorts
 

● | Of the first twelve patients dosed, one (1) patient demonstrated a complete response (“CR”), eight (8) patients demonstrated partial response (“PR”) and three patients demonstrated stable disease (“SD”), as measured by RECIST criteria. This translates to a 100% disease control rate (“DCR”) and 75% objective response rate (“ORR”). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Eleven patients had successful resections of their tumors, with six (6) patients having an R0 resection, which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed, and four (4) patients with a R1 resection, indicating microscopic residual tumor. One patient had an R2, indicating macroscopic residual tumor. One patient in the second cohort was ineligible for debulking surgery due to a medical complication unrelated to the study or the study drug. 
● | Of the eleven surgically treated and evaluable patients, one patient demonstrated a complete pathological response (“cPR”), five (5) patients demonstrated a micro pathological response (“microPR”), and five (5) patients demonstrated a macroPR. These data compare favorably to historical data, which indicate that cPRs are typically seen in less than 7% of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. cPRs have been associated with a median overall survival of 72 months, which is more than three years longer than those who do not experience a cPR. In addition, microPRs are seen in approximately 30% of patients, and are associated with a median overall survival of 38 months.
● | All eleven patients who completed treatment follow-up experienced a dramatic (greater than 90%) drop in their CA-125 protein levels as of their most recent study visit. CA-125 is used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment. CA-125 is present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A 50% reduction in CA-125 levels is considered meaningful. 

Top Line Translational Data from First Two Cohorts
 
Celsion also reported initial translational data from the first two cohorts of patients. Tumor and blood samples collected before the start of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (“NACT”) and after the completion of GEN-1 treatment at debulking surgery are being analyzed for immune cell populations.  Top line data demonstrates intriguing immunological changes in the tumor that are consistent with the activation of the immune system. Specifically,

● | In tumor tissue, there was an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell density in three out of four evaluable patients at debulking surgery. There was a decrease in immunosuppressive FoxP3+ T-cells in two out of those 4 patients. The ratio of CD8+/FoxP3+ cells was increased in all four evaluable patients. High tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell density, low FoxP3+ T-cell density or high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio demonstrate a potential shift in tumor environment to favoring immune stimulation following NACT + GEN-1 therapy. For the remaining two patients the post-treatment tumor tissue was not available. In one of those two patients there was complete pathological response hence no tumor tissue was present to provide a post-treatment comparison. In the other patient the debulking surgery was not performed due to disease related complications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In plasma samples, there was no significant change in T-cell density following the treatment. The density of myeloid derived suppressor cells that are associated with immunosuppression in ovarian cancer were either decreased or did not increase in post-treatment samples.

Additional immune analysis of biological tissue including cytokine ELISA from the first two patient cohorts and a complete analysis of the two higher dose cohorts is in progress. We expect to report the final clinical and translational data from the OVATION Study in mid-2017.
 
GEN-1 + Avastin® + Doxil Combination Study in Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer
 
In April 2015, we announced plans to expand our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase 1 dose escalating trial evaluating GEN-1 in combination with Avastin® and Doxil® in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients.
 
This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin® may result in clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile, as well as the prior Phase 1b trial of GEN-1 plus Doxil® in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients.  Specifically:
 

● | In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin® led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin® (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin® treatment alone. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin® may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin® (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) makes a sound scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-g) pathway may help to explain the remarkable synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin® and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin® therapy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a 16-patient Phase 1b study of GEN-1 in combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, there were no overlapping toxicities between GEN-1 and pegylated doxorubicin (Doxil®). Biological activity and clinical efficacy results, including disease control rates, translational data and survival rates, have been submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncologist (ASCO) Annual Meeting. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On October 12, 2015, we announced the results of an additional preclinical study to support an Investigational New Drug filing with the FDA for the planned Phase I/II combination study.  The study will be designed to optimize the dosing regimen for GEN-1 in combination with Avastin® + Doxil® and is expected to enroll approximately 12 to 18 patients.  Results from the comprehensive preclinical studies showed that GEN-1 when combined with Avastin® and Doxil®, standard of care for platinum resistant patients, indicated a greater than 98% reduction in tumor burden when compared to the untreated control group. The findings represent a reduction in tumor burden and disease progression when compared to the combination of Avastin® and Doxil® in a SKOV3 human cell line implanted into immunocompromised (nude) mice. The study was designed to evaluate in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, the efficacy of a combined treatment regimen that consisted of weekly administrations of GEN-1 with therapeutically relevant doses of Doxil® and Avastin®.

In the study, the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin® and Doxil® showed a robust anti-tumor advantage compared to untreated animals as well as a statistically significant improvement over the combination of Avastin® and Doxil® as summarized below:
 

 | Reduction in Mean Tumor Burden vs. Untreated Control | Percentage of Animals with No Visible Tumors
------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
GEN-1 Immunotherapy | 84% | 50% 
Avastin® + LD Doxil® | 77% | 12% 
Avastin® + HD Doxil® | 88% | 50% 
Avastin® + LD Doxil® + GEN-1 | > 98% | 75% 
Avastin® + HD Doxil® + GEN-1 | > 98% | 75% 
LD - Low Dose; HD - High Dose | 

 
Analysis of serum chemistry and hematology suggested no overt toxicities associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties in addition to its well-characterized immunomodulatory activities.
 
THERAPLAS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM
 
TheraPlas is a technology platform for the delivery of DNA and mRNA therapeutics via synthetic non-viral carriers and is capable of providing cell transfection for double-stranded DNA plasmids and large therapeutic RNA segments such as mRNA. There are two components of the TheraPlas system, a plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding a therapeutic protein, and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation and promote trafficking into cells and through intracellular compartments. We designed the delivery system of TheraPlas by chemically modifying the low molecular weight polymer to improve its gene transfer activity without increasing toxicity. We believe that TheraPlas™ is a viable alternative to current approaches to gene delivery due to several distinguishing characteristics, including enhanced molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety. 
 
The design of TheraPlas delivery systems is based on molecular functionalization of polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic delivery polymer with a distinct ability to escape from the endosomes due to heavy protonation. The transfection activity and toxicity of PEI is tightly coupled to its molecular weight therefore the clinical application of PEI is limited. We have used molecular functionalization strategies to improve the activity of low molecular weight PEIs without augmenting their cytotoxicity. In one instance, chemical conjugation of a low molecular weight branched BPEI1800 with cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form PEG-PEI-Cholesterol (PPC) dramatically improved the transfection activity of BPEI1800 following in vivo delivery. Together, the cholesterol and PEG modifications produced approximately 20-fold enhancement in transfection activity. Biodistribution studies following intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of DNA/PPC nanocomplexes showed DNA delivery localized primarily at the injection site with only small amount escaped into systemic circulation. PPC is the delivery component of our lead TheraPlas product, GEN-1, which is in clinical development for the treatment ovarian cancer and in preclinical development for the treatment of glioblastoma. The PPC manufacturing process has been scaled up from bench scale (1-2 g) to 0.6Kg, and several cGMP lots have been produced with reproducible quality.
 
Another approach to improve PEI activity involved crosslinking low-molecular-weight PEIs through degradable linkages to create larger and degradable structures. Two cross-linked polymers have been synthesized with this approach and optimized for transfection activity. Both cross-linked polymers expressed several fold higher transfection activity than their respective monomers and lower cyotoxicity than a commercially available 25 kDa polymer. One embodiment of the polymer is being developed for in vivo delivery of plasmid DNA and mRNA. Intravenous administration of the nanoparticles carrying DNA or mRNA payload in mice has produced expression with high degree of lung specificity. The lung specificity and safety for mRNA delivery following intravenous administration in mice has been confirmed in non-human primates. These results demonstrate potential clinical utility for delivery of therapeutic DNA and RNA for lung diseases and pulmonary disorders.
 
TheraPlas has emerged as a viable alternative to current approaches due to several distinguishing characteristics such as excellent molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety with little difficulty. The biocompatibility of these polymers reduces the risk of adverse immune response, thus allowing for repeated administration. Compared to naked DNA or cationic lipids, TheraPlas is generally safer, more efficient, and cost effective. We believe that these advantages place Celsion in an excellent position to capitalize on the technology.

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
 
We have not generated and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the next several years, if at all. An element of our business strategy has been to pursue, as resources permit, the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications. We may also evaluate licensing cancer products from third parties for cancer treatments to expand our current product pipeline. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase and results such as those announced in relation to the HEAT study on January 31, 2013 will have a more significant impact on our financial prospects, financial condition and market value. We may also consider and evaluate strategic alternatives, including investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies or products. As demonstrated by the HEAT Study results, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results are extremely difficult to predict. The success or failure of any preclinical development and clinical trial can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and market value. 
 
Our current business strategy includes the possibility of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one or more of our product candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. We may also apply for subsidies, grants or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have $4.3 million dollars in cash and short term investments. Given our development plans, we anticipate cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid-2017 and the Company has no committed sources of additional capital. The Company has a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (see Note 10). As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product if one of our product candidates receives regulatory approval for marketing, if at all. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or whether we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialize approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. Based on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
 
We are engaged in a limited amount of research and development in our own facilities and have sponsored research programs in partnership with various research institutions, including the National Cancer Institute and Duke University. We are currently, with minimal cash expenditures, sponsoring clinical and pre-clinical research at the University of Oxford, University of Utrecht, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the University of Washington. The majority of the spending in research and development is for the funding of ThermoDox® clinical trials. Research and development expenses were approximately $14.6 million and $14.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding expenditures related to our research and development programs.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, recordkeeping, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources
 
Regulation in the United States
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time pre- or post-approval may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 
Research and Development
 
The vehicle by which FDA approves a new pharmaceutical product for sale and marketing in the U.S. is a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The steps ordinarily required before a new drug can be marketed in the U.S. include (a) completion of pre-clinical and clinical studies; (b) submission and FDA acceptance of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; (c) completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product to support each of its proposed indications; (d) submission and FDA acceptance of a NDA; and (e) FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Pre-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practice. The results of pre-clinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Submission of an IND will not necessarily result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials, and the absence of FDA objection to an IND does not necessarily mean that the FDA will ultimately approve an NDA or that a product candidate otherwise will come to market.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and with patient informed consent. Also, each clinical trial must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteers to evaluate the product's safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase III clinical trials are typically conducted in a significantly larger patient population and are intended to further evaluate safety and efficacy, establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
 
There can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will be completed successfully within any specified time period or at all. Either the FDA or we may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including among other things, if we, the FDA, or our independent DMC conclude that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA inspects and reviews clinical trial sites, informed consent forms, data from the clinical trial sites (including case report forms and record keeping procedures) and the performance of the protocols by clinical trial personnel to determine compliance with good clinical practices. The conduct of clinical trials is complex and difficult, and there can be no assurance that the design or the performance of the pivotal clinical trial protocols of any of our current or future product candidates will be successful.
 
 
17



The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to FDA in the form of an NDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted for any product at any time, according to any schedule, or at all. The FDA may refuse to accept or approve an application if it determines that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy. Even, if regulatory approval is granted, the approval will be limited to specific indications. There can be no assurance that any of our current product candidates will receive regulatory approvals for marketing or, if approved, that approval will be for any or all of the indications that we request.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
In 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for ThermoDox® for the treatment of HCC. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. However, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation can also provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits.
 
Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity
 
The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing the new chemical entity may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with various post-approval requirements, including establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the drug's safety and efficacy. The FDA can also impose other post-marketing controls on us as well as our products including, but not limited to, restrictions on sale and use, through the approval process, regulations and otherwise. The FDA also has the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in manufacture. A governmentally mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could result from a number of events or factors, including component failures, manufacturing errors, instability of product or defects in labeling.
 
In addition, manufacturing establishments in the U.S. and abroad are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and must comply with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). To maintain compliance with cGMP, manufacturers must expend funds, time and effort in the areas of production and quality control.
 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union and China, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 
 
18



Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and is optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 
In 2011, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation for ThermoDox® for the treatment of HCC in Europe. As established by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), orphan drug designation provides for scientific advice and regulatory assistance from the EMA, direct access to centralized marketing authorization and certain financial incentives, such as reduction of fees associated with pre-authorization inspections and marketing authorization application fees. The orphan drug designation in Europe also provides 10 years of market exclusivity subsequent to product approval.
 
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We currently contract with third party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for our preclinical and clinical trial supplies, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and any clinical requirements of our product candidates. We have agreements for the supply of such drug materials with manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements.
 
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our CMOs manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the completion of clinical trials and, if and where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of regulatory approvals and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties.
PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE
 
Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. We presently have product liability insurance limited to $10 million per incident, and if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim out of our own limited resources.
COMPETITION
 
Competition in the discovery and development of new methods for treating and preventing disease is intense. We face, and will continue to face, competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies both in the U.S. and abroad. We face significant competition from organizations pursuing the same or similar technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts and from organizations developing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with our product candidates.
 
 
19



Most of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, most of these organizations, either alone or together with their collaborators, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products, undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and manufacturing and marketing products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among our competitors. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants. Our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology field also depends on the status of our collaborations and on the continuing availability of capital to us. 
 
ThermoDox®
 
Although there are many drugs and devices marketed and under development for the treatment of cancer, the Company is not aware of any other heat activated drug delivery product either being marketed or in human clinical development. In addition, the Company is not aware of any other Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of HCC or primary liver cancer. 
 
GEN-1 
 
Studied indications for GEN-1 include ovarian cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain cancer.  In evaluating the competitive landscape for both indications, early stage indications are treated with chemotherapy (temozolomide, BCNU, CCNU for brain cancer; docetaxel, doxil and cisplatinum for ovarian cancer), while later stage ovarian and GBM cancer are treated with Bevacizumab - Avastin®, an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor. Avastin® is currently also being evaluated for early stage disease.
 
In product positioning for both indications, there currently is no direct immunotherapy competitor for GEN-1, which will be studied as an adjuvant to both chemotherapy standard of care regimens, as well as anti-angiogenesis compounds.  To support these cases, we have conducted clinical studies in combination with chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, and preclinical studies in combination with both temozolomide and Bevacizumab-Avastin®.  
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Licenses
 
Duke University License Agreement
 
In 1999, we entered into a license agreement with Duke University under which we received exclusive rights, subject to certain exceptions, to commercialize and use Duke’s thermo-liposome technology.  In relation to these liposome patents licensed from Duke University, we have filed two additional patents related to the formulation and use of liposomes. We have also licensed from Valentis, CA certain global rights covering the use of pegylation for temperature sensitive liposomes.
 
In 2003, our obligations under the license agreement with Duke University with respect to the testing and regulatory milestones and other licensed technology performance deadlines were eliminated in exchange for a payment of shares of our common stock. The license agreement continues to be subject to agreements to pay a royalty based upon future sales. In conjunction with the patent holder, we have filed international applications for a certain number of the U.S. patents. 
 
Our rights under the license agreement with Duke University extend for the longer of 20 years or the end of any term for which any relevant patents are issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Currently we have rights to Duke’s patent for its thermo-liposome technology in the U.S., which expires in 2018, and to future patents received by Duke in Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, where it has patent applications have been granted. The European grant provides coverage in the European Community. For this technology, our license rights are worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, certain European countries, Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Celsion holds an exclusive license agreement with Duke University for its temperature-sensitive liposome technology that covers the ThermoDox® formulation. Celsion also has issued patents which pertain specifically to methods of storing stabilized, temperature-sensitive liposomal formulations and will assist in the protection of global rights.  These patents will extend the overall term of the ThermoDox® patent portfolio to 2026. These patents are the first in this family, which includes pending applications in the U.S., Europe and additional key commercial geographies in Asia.  This extended patent runway to 2026 allows for the evaluation of future development activities for ThermoDox® and Celsion's heat-sensitive liposome technology platform.
 
 
20



For the ThermoDox® technology, we either exclusively license or own U.S. and international patents with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of lysolipid thermally-sensitive liposomes technology, with expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2026.  
 
For the TheraPlas technology, we own three U.S. and international patents and related applications with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of TheraPlas and GEN-1 technologies, with expiration dates ranging  from 2020 to 2028.   
 
There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent can be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences and other third party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product has expired or will be in force for only a short period of time following commercialization. We cannot predict with any certainty if any third party U.S. or foreign patent rights, other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our partners against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In addition to the rights available to us under completed or pending license agreements, we rely on our proprietary know-how and experience in the development and use of heat for medical therapies, which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others. There can be no assurance that these proprietary information agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that these agreements, even if fully enforced, will be adequate to prevent third-party use of the Company’s proprietary technology. Please refer to “Item 1A, Risk Factors,” including, but not limited to, “We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Similarly, we cannot guarantee that technology rights licensed to us by others will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, or that the rights granted will provide us with adequate protection.  Please refer to “Item 1A, Risk Factors,” including, but not limited to, “Our business depends on licensing agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies.  The loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products.”
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of March 23, 2017, we employed 19 full-time employees.  We also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals, most of whom have month-to-month or annual consulting agreements.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
