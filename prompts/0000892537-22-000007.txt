Human Capital Resources
Our talented people have always been and continue to be our greatest asset. Our ability to deliver enduring value to our customers and their critical missions is enabled by the thoughtful innovation, tireless efforts and steadfast dedication of our people.  As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,800 people, 81% of whom hold security clearances and approximately 45% of whom are veterans.  The highly-skilled and cleared nature of our talent base enables us to quickly respond to customer needs and provides us with opportunities to understand and help solve our customers’ most challenging national security problems. Security clearance requirements, and the time and processes required to attain and maintain clearances, serve as a significant barrier to entry in our market.
At ManTech, we believe in the abilities and potential of our people. We invest in attracting, developing, and retaining our talented workforce by providing exciting work assignments and opportunities for skill development and career growth, and we recognize and reward our people for their contributions and accomplishments. In turn, our loyal and career-oriented professionals enjoy great trust and success in helping our customers meet the mission-critical needs of our government.
Training and Development
In recognition of our employees’ interest in career mobility and professional development, we have a robust Career Enablement Initiative. ManTech's Career Enablement Initiative is an employee-initiated, leader supported, and enterprise-wide approach to career growth and development. Since inception, we have seen a rapid adoption of the initiative across the enterprise, as management works to incorporate the initiative into our Company’s culture. In addition, we now offer four career path journeys in the areas of Cyber, IT, Program/Project Management, and P&L Leadership, and have seen an increase in mobility of talent across the organization. Our ManTech University training program, established in 2006, serves as a training platform for the entire company, which we augment with our Skillsoft platform that provides a wide variety of training resources for our employees.
Employee Engagement
We continued to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have supported our employees with the accommodations and support that enable them to continue supporting our customers and their missions despite the difficulties of these unprecedented times. We expanded our dedicated team of engagement specialists, both in reach and in scope, to proactively identify areas of vulnerability and connect with potentially affected employees, identify any trends that relate to employee concern, and build engagement strategies to address systemic issues. Always looking to improve, we surveyed our employees to obtain valuable feedback about their experience and our business culture. We formed a COVID-19 task force to monitor and oversee our response to, and management of, challenges related to the pandemic. We developed and issued health and safety protocols and prepared our leaders to support and respond to the needs of our employees. We prioritized the engagement of our employees, providing our employees with timely and transparent communications, demonstrating strong and visible leadership, and reinforcing of our culture of compassion, which we believe helped us maintain business continuity and led to high levels of retention and employee engagement.
Our Customers
We derive the vast majority of our revenues from U.S. government customers. We have successful, long-standing relationships with these customers, having supported many of them for over half a century. Within the U.S. government, our revenues are well-diversified across a number of intelligence, defense and federal civilian agencies. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2021, our backlog was $10.6 billion, of which $1.6 billion was funded backlog. At December 31, 2020, our backlog was $10.2 billion, of which $1.2 billion was funded backlog.
We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contracts. We also include an estimate of revenue for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which there are established patterns of revenues.
We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and allocated to the contract by the purchasing agency or otherwise authorized for payment by the customer upon completion of a specified portion of work. Our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds for a particular program or contract on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance over a much longer period of time.
A variety of circumstances or events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, the extension of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, the early termination of contracts, and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts. Changes in the amount of our funded backlog also are affected by the funding cycles of the government.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal. However, in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks and days leading up to September 30, which is the end of the government fiscal year. Additionally, our quarterly results are impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. There are generally fewer working days for our employees to generate revenue in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. 
Competitive Landscape
We compete in a market shaped by customer requirements and federal budget priorities and constraints. Our key competitors currently include divisions of large defense contractors, as well as a number of large and mid-size U.S. government contractors with specialized capabilities. Because of the diverse requirements of U.S. government customers and the highly competitive nature of large procurements, we frequently collaborate with these and other companies to compete for large contracts, and we bid against these companies in other situations.
