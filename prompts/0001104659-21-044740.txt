ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Ideanomics, Inc. (“Ideanomics” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDEX) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. From 2010 through 2017, our primary business activities were providing premium content video on demand (“VOD”) services, with primary operations in the PRC, through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) under the brand name You-on-Demand (“YOD.”) We closed the YOD business during 2019.
Starting in early 2017, the Company transitioned its business model to become a next-generation financial technology (“fintech”) company. The Company built a network of businesses, operating principally in the trading of petroleum products and electronic components that the Company believed had significant potential to recognize benefits from blockchain and artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies including enhancing operations, addressing cost inefficiencies, improving documentation and standardization, unlocking asset value and improving customer engagement. During 2018, the Company ceased operations in the petroleum products and electronic components trading businesses and disposed of the businesses during 2019. As we looked to deploy fintech solutions in late 2018 and into 2019, we identified a unique opportunity in the Chinese Electric Vehicle (“EV”) industry to facilitate large scale conversion of fleet vehicles from internal combustion engines to EV. This led us to establish our Mobile Energy Global (“MEG”) business unit. Fintech continues to be a sector of interest to us as we look to invest in and develop businesses that can improve the financial services industry, particularly as it relates to deploying blockchain and AI technologies.
Principal Products or Services and Their Markets
Overview
Ideanomics Mobility
Ideanomics Mobility is driving EV adoption by assembling a synergistic ecosystem of subsidiaries and investments across the 3 key pillars of EV: Vehicles, Charging, and Energy. These three pillars provide the foundation for Ideanomics Mobility’s planned offering of unique business solutions such as Charging as a Service (“CaaS”) and Vehicle as a Service (“VaaS.”)


2



Each operating company within Ideanomics Mobility offers its own unique products and participates in a shared services ecosystem fulfilling Ideanomics’ Sales-to-Financing-to-Charging (“S2F2C”) model, with centralized supply chain operations and marketing expertise designed to accelerate growth and business opportunities across the group.
The combination of products from within its subsidiaries and investments, coupled with Ideanomics Mobility’s shared services, will provide the Company with the opportunity to bring to market unique business solutions intended to drive commercial fleet electrification such as Charging-as-a-Service and Vehicle-as-a-Service. These solutions offer fleet operators an opportunity to benefit from an OpEx-driven model which lowers the barrier to entry for the adoption of zero emissions fleets.
The Company believes that the EV market is poised for rapid growth. Bloomberg NEF estimates that global commercial EV sales will reach 1.2 million units in 2023. The global EV charging infrastructure market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.4% from 2021 to 2028 to $144.97 billion. President Biden’s administration is supportive of EV with a goal to achieve a 100% clean-energy economy and states such as California have accelerated timelines to phase out internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles.
Ideanomics Mobility’s mission is to leverage its ecosystem of synergistic operating companies to generate efficiencies and increase business opportunities across the group. With a diverse commercial EV product offering, the company plans to use EV and EV battery sales and financing solutions to attract commercial fleet operators that will generate large scale demand for energy. The Company operates as an end-to-end solutions provider for the procurement, financing, charging and energy management needs for fleet operators of commercial EV. Ideanomics Mobility focuses on commercial EV rather than passenger personal EV, as commercial EV is on an accelerated adoption path when compared to consumer EV adoption – which is expected to take between ten to fifteen years. We focus on four distinct commercial vehicle types with supporting income streams: 1) Closed-area heavy commercial, in sectors such as Mining, Airports, and Sea Ports 2) Last-mile delivery light commercial 3) Buses and Coaches 4) Taxis. The vehicle financing solutions (such as purchase or leasing) would generate fee-based revenues whereas the charging and energy management would yield recurring revenue streams.
Ideanomics Mobility’s revenues are generated from its S2F2C operating model. The Company’s planned EV revenues will come from the sale of EVs under our Medici Motor Works and Treeletrik brands outside of the China and within China through our MEG operating units sale of other manufacturers vehicles and batteries.
The Company’s presence in the China market creates a deep knowledge of the logistics and supply chain for the manufacture of EVs, batteries and related components; this in turn enables the sourcing of high quality components at competitive prices for the Company’s operations outside of China.
Within the Ideanomics Mobility business unit there are four operating companies:
Mobile Energy Global (“MEG”) 
The Company’s MEG business operates in China where government clean air regulations and subsidy programs provide a strong impetus for the adoption of commercial EV. The Company competes in China using its S2F2C. Using this model the Company helps the customer find the best vehicle for its needs and earns fees for every completed sale; revenue is derived from the spread between group buying of vehicles and price sold, fees for the arrangement of financing, and payments from subsequent charging and energy management.
Tree Technologies Sdn. Bhd. (“Tree Technologies”)
Tree Technologies is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and through its Treeletrik brand sells EV bikes, scooters, and batteries throughout the ASEAN region. Two-wheel bikes and scooters form a large part of the transport infrastructure in the ASEAN region; according to Deloitte Consulting, there were 13.7 million motor bikes sold in the six major ASEAN countries in 2019. Environmental regulations in the ASEAN region help accelerate the adoption of EV bikes. The Company has also started to import Treeletrik brand EV bikes into the United States.

Medici Motor Works 
Medici Motor Works plans to sell its own brand vehicles in the United States, Latin America and Europe. Presently, the Company is working with manufacturers based in China to design and build trucks, buses and closed-area vehicles for mining, airports and seaports.
Solectrac, Inc. (“Solectrac”)
On October 21, 2020 the Company acquired 15%, and on November 23, 2020 the Company subsequently increased its ownership to 24% in California-based Solectrac, Inc. Solectrac develops, assembles and distributes 100% battery-powered electric tractors—an alternative to diesel tractors—for agriculture and utility operations. 
According to Research And Markets, the global agricultural tractor market is currently valued at $75 billion, with the North American agricultural tractor market expected to reach $20 billion by 2023. The largest segment for agricultural tractors is the below-40HP segment, where Solectrac's initial three models address the broad needs of the market. Its tractors are specifically designed to serve the needs of community-based farms, vineyards, orchards, equestrian arenas, greenhouses, and hobby farms.
Founded in 2012 to take electric tractors into commercial production, Solectrac was incorporated as a California Benefit Corp in 2019. It has received grants from the Indian U.S. Science and Technology Fund and the National Science Foundation. In 2020, Solectrac received the World Alliance Solar Impulse Efficient Solutions label from the Solar Impulse Foundation. The label was awarded for being one of the one thousand most efficient and profitable solutions that can transition society to being economically viable while being environmentally sustainable.
Recent Developments Since December 31, 2020
Since December 31, 2020 the Company has completed a number of transactions that have expanded the scope of the Company’s EV activities.
WAVE
On January 15, 2021 acquired 100% of privately held Wireless Advanced Vehicle Electrification, Inc. ("WAVE.")
Founded in 2011, and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, WAVE is a leading provider of inductive (wireless) charging solutions for medium and heavy-duty EVs. Embedded in roadways and depot facilities, the WAVE system automatically charges vehicles during scheduled stops. The hands-free WAVE system eliminates battery range limitations and enables fleets to achieve driving ranges that match that of internal combustion engines.
Deployed since 2012, WAVE has demonstrated the capability to develop and integrate high-power charging systems into heavy-duty EVs from leading commercial EV manufacturers. With commercially available wireless charging systems up to 250kW and higher power systems in development, WAVE provides custom fleet solutions for mass transit, logistics, airport and campus shuttles, drayage fleets, and off-road vehicles at ports and industrial sites.
Wireless charging systems offer several compelling benefits over plug-in-based charging systems, including reduced maintenance, improved health and safety, and expedited energy connection and are important to the deployment of autonomous driving vehicles. Furthermore, wireless in-route charging enables greater route lengths or smaller batteries while also maintaining battery life, thereby reducing costs for fleet operators. WAVE customers include what is currently the largest EV bus system in the U.S., the Antelope Valley Transit Authority, and its partnerships include Kenworth, Gillig, BYD, Complete Coach Works and the Department of Energy.
Energica Motor Company, S.P.A. (“Energica”)
On March 3, 2021 the Company purchased 20% of Energica, the world's leading manufacturer of high-performance electric motorcycles and the sole manufacturer of the FIM Enel MotoE™ World Cup. Energica has combined zero emission EV technology with the pedigree of high-performance mobility synonymous with Italy’s Motor Valley to create a range of exceptional products for the high-performance motorcycle market. To support its products, it has developed proprietary EV battery and DC fast-charging in-house that has applications and synergies with Ideanomics’ broader interests in the global EV sector.

Silk EV Cayman LP (“Silk”)
On January 28, 2021, the Company invested $15.0 million in Silk EV via a promissory note. Silk is an Italian engineering and design services company that has recently partnered with FAW to form a new company (Silk-FAW) to produce fully electric, luxury vehicles for the Chinese and Global auto markets. Silk-FAW has exclusive rights to develop Hongqi-S brand high-end electric sports cars. The Hongqi brand is the most well-known luxury auto brand in China. Silk-FAW vehicles are being designed in Italy’s Motor Valley and is attracting talent from the luxury and high-performance auto market. Partnering with Silk provides access to Silk-FAW’s Innovation Centers providing us insight into technological advancements and all best-in-breed technology evaluated at those centers to support the development of high-performance sportscars (battery tech, power management systems, high performance motors.)
Ideanomics Capital
Ideanomics Capital is the Company's fintech business unit, which focuses on leveraging technology and innovation to improve efficiency, transparency, and profitability for the financial services industry.
Technology Metals Market Limited (“TM2”)
TM2 is a London based digital commodities issuance and trading platform for technology metals. It connects institutional investors, proprietary traders and retail investors with metals suppliers – miners, refiners, recyclers and mints. The platform focuses specifically on new metals that currently don’t have an active trading marketplace, such as rhodium, lithium, cobalt, rhenium, etc. The Company’s ownership interest in TM2 provides valuable data and insight into the global technology metals market, which is critical to the future of the Cleantech and EV industries. TM2 connects both pillars of Cleantech and Fintech. The types of metals and materials traded on the TM2 platform are critical to Cleantech (for EV battery production, energy storage systems, solar cells, etc.,) while the Fintech platform is innovative in representing these commodities which do not exist on traditional exchanges.
On January 28, 2021, the Company entered into a simple agreement for future equity with TM2 pursuant to which Ideanomics invested $2.1 million. This investment is a follow-on investment further the Company’s prior investment of $1.2 million in stock-based consideration in December 2019.
Delaware Board of Trade (“DBOT”)
The Delaware Board of Trade (“DBOT”) is a broker dealer that also operates an Alternative Trading System (“ATS,”) presently DBOT is not trading; the business remains in full regulatory compliance. Recent developments have pointed to increased recognition of digital securities’ relevance in regulated global capital markets. As well, regulatory easing of certain restrictions such as the threshold for private securities (Reg A+), along with good demand for products such as pre-IPO issuance, provide good tailwind for the broker dealers business. The Company has filed a continuing membership application for private placement activities in the primary markets. The Company believes that growing demand for private placements, along with increased attention in digital securities, provide a favorable environment for DBOT’s future growth.
Timios
On January 8, 2021 the Company acquired 100% of privately-held Timios Holdings Corp. ("Timios.") Timios, a nationwide title and escrow services provider, which has been expanding in recent years through offering innovative and freedom-of-choice-friendly solutions for real estate transactions. The products include residential and commercial title insurance, closing and settlement services, as well as specialized offerings for the mortgage process industry.
Ideanomics expects that Timios will become one of the cornerstones of Ideanomics Capital. Timios combines difficult to obtain local and state licenses, a knowledgeable and experienced team, and a scalable platform to deliver best-in-class services through both centralized processing and localized branch networks. Ideanomics will assist Timios in scaling its business in various ways, including referring client acquisitions and product innovation.
Founded in 2008 by real estate industry veteran Trevor Stoffer, Timios' vision is to bring transparency to real estate transactions. The company offers title and settlement, appraisal management, and real-estate-owned (“REO”) title and closing services in 44 states and currently serves more than 280 national and regional clients.

Non-Core Assets
The Company has identified a number of business units that it considers non-core and is evaluating strategies for divesting these assets. The non-core assets are Grapevine, a marketing and ecommerce platform focused on influencer marketing, and FinTech Village a 58-acre development site in West Hartford, Connecticut.
On January 28, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors accepted an offer of $2.75 million for Fintech Village, and subsequently signed a non-binding sale contract on March 15, 2021. The Company believes that Fintech Village met the criteria for held for sale classification on January 28, 2021.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The Company’s Tree Technologies business located in Malaysia and its WAVE business located in Utah, United States, (acquired in the first quarter of 2021 – see Recent Developments section) assemble and manufacture motor bikes and inductive charging systems respectively. These businesses depend on a ready supply of components that are sourced domestically and internationally and any interruption to the supply of components could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results. The Company’s suppliers that manufacture EVs and batteries depend on a ready supply of raw materials and components, consequently a shortage of raw materials or components could adversely impact their manufacturing process and, potentially, impact the Company’s revenues as it may not be able to complete orders that it had received. The Company may also be adversely impacted if global logistic and supply chains are interrupted.
Seasonality
The Company expects that orders and sales will be influenced by the amount and timing of budgeted expenditure by its customers. Typically, the Company would expect to see higher sales at the start of the year when companies start executing on their capital programs and at the end of the year when companies are spending any surplus or uncommitted budget before the new budget cycle commences. The Company’s operating businesses are in the early stage of their development and consequently do not have sufficient trading histories to project seasonal buying patterns with any degree of confidence.
Working Capital Requirements
As the Company expands its business the need for working capital will continue to grow. From time to time the Company’s MEG operating division in China has the opportunity to purchase a large number of vehicles at a favorable price, the terms of the purchase contract frequently require the Company to pay some or all of the cost in advance of the delivery of the vehicles with the resultant need to commit material amounts of working capital. The Company’s Tree Technologies subsidiary requires working capital to support the assembly of EV motor bikes and scooters for the ASEAN market. The Company acquired WAVE and Solectrac in the first quarter of 2021 (see the Recent Developments section), both of these businesses will require working capital to fund the purchase of components for the assembly of wireless charging systems and electric tractors, respectively. The Company will continue to raise both debt and equity capital to support the working capital needs of these businesses and its U.S. Head Office functions.
Trade marks, Patents and Licenses
The Company’s Intelligenta business operates under a license granted by Seasail Ventures Limited (“Seasail.”) The license does not have a stated term.
Customer Concentration
The Company is in the process of building out its Ideanomics Mobility unit and has not yet reached a stage of development where the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Reliance on Government Contracts
The Company does not contract directly with the government of the PRC, however it does have investments, partnerships and agreements with the State Own Entities (“SOE”) described above. Additionally, the rate at which commercial fleets convert to EV is heavily

influenced by federal and provincial policies in the PRC as they relate to clean air and adoption of EV technology. Consequently, the Company’s results may be adversely impacted by changes in regulations in the PRC.
Competitive Business Conditions, Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
Ideanomics Mobility
Purchasers of commercial vehicles have the choice between traditional ICE vehicles and EVs and this is likely to continue for at least the next five years and possibly longer. The most important drivers for the development of the commercial fleet EV market are federal and provincial regulations relating to clean air and electronic vehicles including subsidies and incentives to help owners of fleets of commercial vehicles to convert from combustion engines to EV. The speed at which fleet operators convert to EV is highly correlated with government regulations, targets and related subsidies and incentives. If the governments, or municipalities, change the regulations, targets, incentives or subsidies then the rate at which fleet operators convert their vehicles to EV could slow down which in turn may lead to lower revenues for the Company. Additionally, the rate, and form in which, the commercial fleet EV market develops is dependent upon technological developments in battery and charging systems; deployment of the charging infrastructure to support widespread commercial EV use and the development of new financing and lending structures that address the different collateral and resale values of the battery and vehicle versus internal combustion engine vehicles. 
In addition to its directly owned operations the Company operates through a network of investment arrangements, partnerships and formal and informal alliances; consequently, its competitive position could be adversely impacted if one of the members of the alliance was not able to meet the demand for its products, decides not to continue to cooperate with the Company, or goes out of business.

Ideanomics Capital
The Company’s Ideanomics Capital business unit operates in sectors that are undergoing rapid change.
DBOT is a broker dealer that also operates an ATS. In April 2020 the Company ceased trading OTC equities, terminated the employees assigned to DBOT and the services needed to operate the business. The Company has continued to maintain DBOT’s regulatory licenses and required regulatory capital. The Company has applied for regulatory approval to broker digital securities and tokens, this is a nascent market which the Company believes has good long term potential.

VIE Structure and Arrangements
The Company consolidated certain VIEs located in the PRC in which it held variable interests and was the primary beneficiary through contractual agreements. The Company was the primary beneficiary because it had the power to direct activities that most significantly affected their economic performance and had the obligation to absorb or right to receive the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. A shareholder in one of the VIEs is the spouse of Bruno Wu (“Dr. Wu,”) the former Chairman of the Company.
Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
The contractual agreements listed below, which collectively granted the Company the power to direct the VIEs activities that most significantly affected their economic performance, as well to cause the Company to have the obligation to absorb or right to receive the majority of their losses or benefits, were terminated by all parties on December 31, 2019. As a result, the Company deconsolidated the VIEs as of December 31, 2019. The deconsolidation resulted in a net loss of $2.0 million recorded in “Gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries, net” in the consolidated statements of operations, and a statutory income tax of $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
For these consolidated VIEs, their assets were not available to the Company and their creditors did not have recourse to the Company. Prior to December 31, 2019, in order to operate certain legacy business in the PRC and to comply with PRC laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that provides value-added telecommunication services, the Company entered into a series of contractual agreements with two VIEs. These contractual agreements were initially set to expire in March 2030 and April 2036, respectively, and could not be terminated by the VIEs, except with the consent of, or a material breach, by the Company. A shareholder in one of the VIEs is the spouse of Dr. Wu, the former Chairman of the Company. 
The key terms of the VIE Agreements are summarized as follows:

Our Unconsolidated Equity Investments
We hold a 34.0% ownership interest in Glory, which through its subsidiary Tree Manufacturing, holds a domestic EV manufacturing license in Malaysia. Tree Manufacturing had entered into a product supply and a product distribution arrangement for EVs with Tree Technologies, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
In 2018, we signed an investment agreement to establish Intelligenta for providing services for financial or energy industries by utilizing AI and big data technology in the United States.  We hold a 60.0% ownership interest and Seasail holds 40% of Intelligenta. 
On October 22, 2020, the Company acquired 1.4 million common shares, representing 15.0% of the total common shares outstanding, of Solectrac for a purchase price of $0.91 per share, for total consideration of $1.3 million. On November 19, 2020, Ideanomics acquired an additional 1.3 million shares of common stock for $1.00 per share, for a subsequent investment of $1.3 million. With this subsequent investment, Ideanomics owned 2.7 million common shares out of a total number of issued and outstanding common shares of 10.2 million after the transaction, or 27.0%. 
Solectrac develops, assembles and distributes 100% battery-powered electric tractors-an alternative to diesel tractors-for agriculture and utility operations. Solectrac tractors provide an opportunity for farmers around the world to power their tractors by using the sun, wind, and other clean renewable sources of energy.
Our investments in Glory, BDCG and Solectrac, where we may exercise significant influence, but not control, are classified as a long-term equity investments and accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of undistributed earnings or losses of the investee. Investment losses are recognized until the investment is written down to nil, provided that we do not guarantee the investee’s obligations or we are committed to provide additional funding.
In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded impairment losses with respect to its equity method investments of $16.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively.

Our Competition
Ideanomics Mobility Business Unit
The Company’s EV business operates in the market for fleet commercial vehicles, this market is still in its development stage. The Company could face competition from other companies that develop and operate a similar integrated platform for the procurement, purchase, financing, charging and energy management needs of fleet EV operators. The Company could also face competition from companies that only operate in one part of the vehicle purchase and operation cycle, for example, an EV vehicle or battery manufacturer may sell directly to EV fleet operators while also participating in the platform operated by the Company’s MEG business.

Other
Grapevine competes in the consumer marketing sector and specializes in designing and managing “influencer” led social media campaigns for brands and advertising agencies that do not have a capability to manage influencer marketing campaigns directly. This is a very competitive sector with multiple competitors.
Revenue Recognition
The Company records and reports revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., particularly ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which provides guidance on how revenues should be reported and the timing of when revenues should be reported. ASC 606 includes guidance on when revenue should be recognized on a Gross (Principal) or Net (Agent) basis, the Company’s contracts are typically with large enterprises and consequently are heavily negotiated as to the services to be provided; consequently the accounting treatment for the reporting of revenues may vary materially between contracts including whether the revenue is reported on a Principal (Gross) or Agent (Net) basis.
Regulation
General Regulation of Businesses in the PRC
We are required to obtain government approval from or filing with the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC (“MOFCOM”) and/or other government agencies in the PRC for transactions, such as our acquisition or disposition of business entities in the PRC. Additionally, foreign ownership of certain business and assets in the PRC is not permitted without specific government approval.
Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) ("Negative List") and the Catalogue of Industries for Encouraged Foreign Investment ("Encouraged Foreign Investment Catalogue," together with the Negative List, the "Catalogue,") which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Catalogue sets forth the industries in which foreign investments are encouraged, restricted, or prohibited. Industries that are not listed in any of the above three categories are permitted areas for foreign investments and are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Establishment of wholly foreign owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.
Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is subject to the approval of or filing with the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent administration for market regulation. Our significant PRC subsidiaries have duly obtained all material approvals required for their business operations.
In addition, the transportation sector is subject to regulation at the central and provincial level. The PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on existing laws, some of which are not published on a timely basis or may have retroactive effect. Administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may also be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current tax laws, and our legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on our ability to conduct business in the PRC.
Chinese regulations will also significantly impact our MEG business unit. For example, in September 2017, reports were published that the PRC may begin prohibiting the practice of using digital assets for capital fundraising. In 2018, reports surfaced that the PRC had banned local digital asset exchanges from operating within the country. On January 10, 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China passed the Administrative Provisions on Blockchain Information Services (“Provisions on Blockchain,”) which took effect on February 19, 2019. The Provisions on Blockchain clarify terms of the scope of blockchain information services, the filing process for blockchain information services, the responsibilities for blockchain information service providers, and the consequences of violations. Until there is greater regulatory clarity and acceptance of digital token and blockchain-based financial products in the PRC, we may not be able to provide services under our MEG business unit in the PRC.

Taxation
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC passed the Enterprise Income Tax law (“EIT Law,”) and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules which took effect on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified earned income tax (“EIT”) rate of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and foreign invested enterprises (“FIEs”) unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. In addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with “de facto management bodies” within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as “an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.” If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our organization’s global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see Part I—Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in the PRC- Under the EIT Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in dividends payable to our foreign investor and gains on sale of our common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC taxation.”
Foreign Currency Exchange
Under the PRC foreign currency exchange regulations applicable to us, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Currently, our PRC operating entities may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE,”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating entities borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be registered or filed with by certain government authorities. These limitations could affect our PRC operating entities’ ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.
Dividend Distributions
PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC entities to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC entities only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiaries have the discretion to allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
In addition, under the EIT law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates (“Notice 112,”) which was issued on January 29, 2008, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our entities will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Furthermore, the ultimate tax rate will be determined by treaty between the PRC and the tax residence of the holder of the PRC subsidiary. Dividends declared and paid from before January 1, 2008 on distributable profits are grandfathered under the EIT Law and are not subject to withholding tax.
We intend to reinvest profits, if any, and do not intend on making cash distributions of dividends in the near future.
Regulation Regarding our Fintech Businesses
Securities and Commodities Laws

Depending on a securities exchange’s activities, it may be required to also register as a broker dealer on the state level. DBOT is a registered broker dealer with an ATS. Depending upon the jurisdiction, we may also be required to comply with laws applicable to securities exchanges.

Financial Crimes and Sanctions Compliance
The jurisdictions in which we operate and intend to operate generally have adopted laws to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other financial crime, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions regimes. Various aspects of our business require us to develop and implement policies and procedures that confirm the identity of customers, detect suspicious activities and ensure we do not do business with blocked persons. 
Environmental Disclosures
As part of the acquisition of the Fintech Village property (see Part I—Item 2—“Properties,”) we agreed to assume responsibility for completing environmental remediation, previously initiated by the prior owner, relating to the cleanup of asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”) from building materials on the property and any contamination of soil and groundwater on the land, an existing condition cited by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for the State of Connecticut (“DEEP.”) We were required, as part of the purchase of the land, to post an $8.0 million surety bond, the approximate cost of previous remediation costs. The surety bond will serve either serve as collateral to the state if we do not complete the environmental remediation to state and federal requirements or be returned to us in full if remediation efforts are successful and completed.
On January 28, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors accepted an offer of $2.75 million for Fintech Village, and subsequently signed a non-binding sale contract on March 15, 2021. The Company is required to remove or renovate the contaminated buildings on the property. If we elect to sell, transfer or change the use of the facility, additional environmental testing may be required. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination, that any planned timeline for remediation will not be delayed, that we would not be required by DEEP or the EPA to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.
