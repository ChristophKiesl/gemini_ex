Overview
Kimball Electronics was founded in 1961 and was incorporated in 1998. We are a global, multifaceted manufacturing solutions provider. We provide contract electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) and diversified manufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain support, to customers in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety end markets.  We offer a package of value that begins with our core competency of producing durable electronics and have expanded into diversified contract manufacturing services for non-electronic components, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and production automation, test, and inspection equipment. This package of value includes our set of robust processes and procedures that help us ensure that we deliver the highest levels of quality, reliability, and service throughout the entire life cycle of our customers’ products.  We believe our customers appreciate our body of knowledge as it relates to the design and manufacture of their products that require durability, reliability, the highest levels of quality control, and regulatory compliance.  We deliver award-winning service from our highly integrated global footprint which is enabled by a largely common operating system, a standardization strategy, global procedures, and teamwork.  Our Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) model is key to providing our customers convenient access to our global footprint and all of our services throughout the entire product life cycle.  Because our customers are in businesses where engineering changes must be tightly controlled and long product life cycles are common, our track record of quality, financial stability, social responsibility, and commitment to long-term relationships is important to them.
We have been producing safety critical electronic assemblies for our automotive customers for over 35 years.  During this time, we have built up a body of knowledge that has not only proven to be valuable to our automotive customers, but to our medical, industrial, and public safety customers as well.  We have been successful in growing and diversifying our business by leveraging our automotive experience and know-how in the areas of design and process validation, traceability, process and change control, and lean manufacturing to create valuable and innovative solutions for customers in the medical, industrial, and public safety end market verticals.  These solutions include diversified contract manufacturing services for medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and design, production, and servicing of automation, test, and inspection equipment for industrial applications. We have harmonized our quality systems to be compliant with various important industry certifications and regulatory requirements.  This allows us to take advantage of other strategic points of leverage in the supply chain and within 
our operations so we can cost-effectively manufacture electronic and non-electronic products in the same production facility for customers from all four of our end market verticals.
Many of our customers are multinational companies that sell their products in multiple regions of the world.  For these customers, it is important for them to be able to leverage their investment in their supply partner relationships such that the same partner provides them with engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain support in multiple regions of the world. It is common for us to manufacture the same product for the same customer in multiple locations.  Our strategy for expanding our global footprint has aligned us with the preferences of the customers in our four end market verticals and has positioned us well to support their global growth initiatives.  Our global systems, procedures, processes, and teamwork combined with our CRM model have allowed us to accomplish this goal for many of our largest customers.
Our global processes and central functions that support component sourcing, procurement, quoting, and customer pricing provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in which we operate. We have a central, global sourcing organization that utilizes procurement processes and practices to help secure sources from around the world and to ensure sufficient availability of components and a uniform approach to pricing while leveraging the purchase volume of the entire organization. Customer pricing for the products we produce is primarily managed centrally utilizing a standardized quoting model regardless of where our customers request their products to be produced.
Our CRM model combines members of our team from within our manufacturing facilities and members of our business development team who reside remotely and nearer to our customers around the world.  We also have cross-functional teams in the areas of quality, operational excellence, quoting, and design engineering with representatives from our various locations that provide support to our teams on a global basis. The skill sets of these team members and the clarity in their roles and responsibilities help provide our customers with a strong conduit that is critical to execution and forming a strong relationship.  We have institutionalized a customer scorecard process that provides all levels of our company with valuable feedback that helps us drive the actions for continuous improvement.  Our customer scorecard process has helped us deliver award-winning service and build loyalty with our customers.
Our corporate headquarters is located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana. Production occurs in our facilities located in the United States, China, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Major Competitive Factors
Key competitive factors in the markets we serve include competitive pricing, quality and reliability, engineering design services, production flexibility, on-time delivery, customer lead time, test capability, and global presence. Numerous contract manufacturing service providers compete globally for business from existing and potential customers. We also face competition from our customers’ own capacity and capabilities to in-source production. Growth in the EMS industry is created through the proliferation of electronic components in today’s advanced products and the continuing trend of original equipment manufacturers in the electronics industry subcontracting the assembly process to companies with a core competency in this area. The nature of the EMS industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently. New customers and program start-ups generally cause margin dilution early in the life of a program, which is generally recovered as the program becomes established and matures. Our continuing success depends upon our ability to replace expiring customers/programs with new customers/programs.
We do not believe that we, or the industry in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our business other than fluctuating inventory levels which may increase in conjunction with the start-up of new programs and component availability.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths derive from our experience of producing safety critical electronic assemblies for automotive customers for over 35 years and leveraging this experience to create valuable and innovative solutions for customers in different industries. Our core strengths include:
•Our core competency of producing durable electronics;
•Our body of knowledge as it relates to the design and manufacture of products that require high levels of quality control, reliability, and durability;
•Our highly integrated, global footprint;
•Our capability to provide our customers diversified contract manufacturing services for non-electronic components, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and automation, test, and inspection equipment;
•Our CRM model and our customer scorecard process;
•Our ability to provide our customers with valuable input regarding designs for improved manufacturability, reliability, and cost;
•Our quality systems, industry certifications, and regulatory compliance;
•Our integrated supply chain solutions and competitive bid process resulting in competitive raw material pricing; and
•Complete product life cycle management.
Competitors
The EMS industry is very competitive as numerous manufacturers compete for business from existing and potential customers. Our competition includes EMS companies such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., Plexus Corp., and Sanmina Corporation. We do not have a significant share of the EMS market and were ranked the 20th largest global EMS provider for calendar year 2020 by Manufacturing Market Insider in the March 2021 edition published by New Venture Research.
Locations
As of June 30, 2021, we have eleven manufacturing facilities with two located in Indiana, two in China, and one located in each of California, Florida, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Thailand, and Vietnam. Our software design services are primarily performed at our location in India. We continually assess our capacity needs and evaluate our operations to optimize our service levels for supporting our customers’ needs around the globe. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for information regarding financial and operational risks related to our international operations. 
Seasonality
Consolidated sales revenue is generally not affected by seasonality.
Customers 
While the total electronic assemblies market has broad applications, our customers are concentrated in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety industries. 
Sales by industry as a percent of net sales for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021 were as follows:

 | Year Ended June 30
 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Automotive | 43% | 38% | 40% 
Medical | 30% | 33% | 31% 
Industrial | 23% | 23% | 22% 
Public Safety | 3% | 5% | 6% 
Other | 1% | 1% | 1% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100%

Included in our sales were a significant amount to Nexteer Automotive, Philips, and ZF, which accounted for the following portions of net sales:

 | Year Ended June 30
 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Nexteer Automotive | 17% | 14% | 12% 
Philips | 15% | 16% | 14% 
ZF | * | * | 12% 
* amount is less than 10% of total | | | 

The nature of the contract manufacturing business is such that start-up of new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently. Our agreements with customers are often not for a definitive term and are amended and extended, but generally continue for the relevant product’s life cycle, which can be difficult to predict at the beginning of a program.  Typically, our customer agreements do not commit the customer to purchase our services until a purchase order is provided, which are generally short term in nature. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular program subject to contractual provisions governing termination, the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory, and end-of-life pricing, which reduces the additional costs that we incur when a manufacturing services agreement is terminated. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials utilized in the manufacture of contract electronic products are generally readily available from both domestic and foreign sources, although from time to time the industry experiences shortages of certain components due to supply and demand forces, combined with rapid product life cycles of certain components. In addition, unforeseen events such as natural disasters and the COVID-19 global pandemic can and have disrupted portions of the supply chain. We believe that maintaining close communication with suppliers helps minimize potential disruption in our supply chain. 
The EMS industry is currently experiencing component shortages, component allocations, and shipping delays, particularly with semiconductors, driven by the strong demand in consumer electronics and the beginning of a global recovery, and complicated by the continued impact of COVID-19. Component shortages or allocations could increase component costs and potentially interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. The semiconductor shortage has adversely impacted global manufacturing, including the automotive industry, leading to automakers temporarily suspending production in recent months. We have taken various actions to mitigate the risk and minimize the impact to our customers as well as the adverse effect component shortages or allocations could have on our results.
Raw materials are normally acquired for specific customer orders and may or may not be interchangeable among products. Inherent risks associated with rapid technological changes within this contract industry are mitigated by procuring raw materials, for the most part, based on firm orders. In certain instances, such as when lead times dictate, we enter into contractual agreements for material in excess of the levels required to fulfill customer orders. In turn, material authorization agreements with customers cover a portion of the exposure for material which is purchased prior to having a firm order. We may also purchase additional inventory to support new product introductions, transfers of production between manufacturing facilities, and to mitigate the potential impact from component shortages. 
Intellectual Property
Our primary intellectual property is our proprietary manufacturing technology and processes that allow us to provide competitive contract manufacturing and design services to our customers. As such, this intellectual property is complex and normally contained within our facilities. To protect our trade secrets, our manufacturing technology and processes, and other proprietary rights, we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws pertaining to trade secrets and copyrights; non-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees, and suppliers; and our internal security procedures and systems. We feel that relying on trade secret or copyright protections is a superior strategy because there is no disclosure of the information to outside parties, and protections do not expire after a length of time. We currently have or are pursuing a modest number of patents for some of our innovations and technologies in the United States and foreign countries. We also maintain trademark rights (including registrations) for “Kimball Electronics,” “GES” and other wordmarks and trademarks that we use in our business in the United States and around the world. We have policies and procedures to identify and protect our own intellectual property and that of our customers and suppliers. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We are committed to our environmental, social, and governance philosophies and practices, which have been a part of who we are since our founding in 1961. To showcase how our employees around the world share a strong sense of responsibility to protect the environment, sustain a safety focus at our facilities, and give back in meaningful ways to the communities where we live and work, we issued our latest annual Environmental, Social & Governance Report (“ESG Report”) in December 2020. The ESG Report highlights the long-term environmental, social, and governance principles, and practices designed to support the Company’s commitment to sustaining “lasting relationships” and achieving “global success” with its stakeholders wherever Kimball Electronics’ touch is felt throughout the world. The ESG Report reflects several long-standing Guiding Principles of the Company: Our customer is our business; our people are the company; the environment is our home; we strive to help our communities be great places to live; profitability and financial resources give us the freedom to shape our future and achieve our vision. The ESG Report is posted on our website.
Environment and Energy Matters
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items.
We are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in protecting the environment and communities in which we have operations. We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Management believes capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures. 
Our operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and electricity. Federal, foreign, and state regulations may control the allocation of fuels available to us, but to date we have experienced no interruption of production due to such regulations.
Our People are the Company: Human Capital Management 
We believe our people are the company. We believe in creating quality for life. We believe lasting relationships create our global success. We believe our people are the competitive edge for our service, quality and value. Kimball Electronics has been built upon the tradition of pride in craftsmanship, mutual trust, personal integrity, respect for dignity of the individual, a spirit of cooperation, and a sense of family and good humor. We seek to enhance this culture as we grow. We believe in the inherent value of all individuals. 
To raise awareness of our commitment to human rights and to foster compliance with our Global Human Rights Policy, we have incorporated it as an integral part of our Code of Conduct, train all of our employees worldwide on human rights issues, and require our suppliers, vendors, contractors, and partners to meet the same standards. To this end, through our Guiding Principles, we champion transparency and accountability for ourselves. 
Because our people are the reason for our success, central to our long-term strategy is attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent globally and strengthening collaboration. We are committed to pay equity and apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value in all regions where we operate. As of June 30, 2021, Kimball Electronics employed approximately 6,400 people worldwide, with approximately 1,300 located in the United States and approximately 5,100 located in foreign countries. Approximately fifty percent of our worldwide workforce is female, including fifty percent of our executive officers. Ten 
percent of our executive officers are African American and ten percent are Hispanic or Latino. We continue to execute on our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and exhibit our commitment to gender, racial, and ethnic diversity by striving toward the corporate goals we outline in our Global Human Rights Policy, including by:
•Increasing female representation globally at the executive and senior management levels;
•Increasing racial and ethnic diversity at the executive and senior management levels so our leadership will reflect our organization and the communities in which we operate;
•Holding leadership accountable for diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes.
The average tenure within our workforce is 6.6 years, and we work hard to mitigate turnover risk by consistently and formally surveying our workforce about how well we are living up to our People Guiding Principles by asking them to anonymously rate us on a scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high). We currently have a score of 8.15 across our enterprise. We believe this is evidence that we truly operate our business as our people are the company. We consistently have a participation rate in our Guiding Principles survey that exceeds 90%. Upon completion of this survey every year, each local management team receives qualitative and quantitative feedback and are responsible for crafting improvement plans based on our people’s inputs.
Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Certain foreign operations are subject to collective bargaining arrangements, many mandated by government regulation or customs of the particular countries. We believe that our employee relations are good.
