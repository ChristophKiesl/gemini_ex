ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Our Company
We are one of the world’s leading transportation finance companies. We lease equipment, primarily intermodal shipping containers, to our customers. We also manage equipment for third-party investors. In operating our fleet, we lease, re-lease and dispose of equipment and contract for the repair, repositioning and storage of equipment. 
The following tables show the composition of our fleet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and our average utilization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:


 | As of December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019
Owned container fleet in TEUs | | 1,688,351 | | 1,611,527
Managed container fleet in TEUs | | 56,298 | | 69,650 
Total container fleet in TEUs | | 1,744,649 | | 1,681,177
Owned container fleet in CEUs | | 1,727,202 | | 1,642,118
Managed container fleet in CEUs | | 71,318 | | 85,698 
Total container fleet in CEUs | | 1,798,520 | | 1,727,816


 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019
Average container fleet utilization in CEUs | | 98.5% | | 98.6%
Average owned container fleet utilization in CEUs | | 98.5% | | 98.7%


The intermodal marine container industry-standard measurement unit is the 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU), which compares the size of a container to a standard 20-foot container. For example, a 20-foot container is equivalent to one TEU and a 40-foot container is equivalent to two TEUs. Containers can also be measured in cost equivalent units (CEUs), whereby the cost of each type of container is expressed as a ratio relative to the cost of a standard 20-foot dry van container. For example, the CEU ratio for a standard 40-foot dry van container is 1.6, and a 40-foot high cube container is 1.7. 
Utilization of containers is computed by dividing the average total units on lease during the period in CEUs, by the average total CEUs in our container fleet during the period. The total fleet excludes new units not yet leased and off-hire units designated for sale. If new units not yet leased are included in the total fleet, utilization would be 97.1% for both total and owned container fleet for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our revenue from continuing operations consists of container lease revenue from our owned container fleet and management fee revenue for managing containers for third-party investors. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded revenue from continuing operations of $294.0 million and net income attributable to CAI common stockholders of $18.9 million. A comparison of our 2020 financial results with those of the prior year can be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We earn container lease revenue from intermodal containers, which are deployed by our customers in a wide variety of global trade routes. Virtually all of our containers are used internationally, and no container is domiciled in one particular place for a prolonged period of time. As such, substantially all of our container assets are considered to be international with no single country of use. 
Disposal of Logistics and Rail Businesses
﻿
On August 14, 2020, we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our logistics business to NFI, a North American logistics provider, for cash proceeds of $6.2 million. On December 29, 2020, we sold our remaining railcar fleet to affiliates of Infinity Transportation for cash proceeds of $228.1 million. As a result, the operating results of the logistics and rail leasing businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and cash flows. All prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been restated to reflect the classification of the logistics and rail leasing businesses as discontinued operations and certain assets and liabilities as held for sale. See Note 3 – Discontinued Operations in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information.

History
We were founded in 1989, as a traditional container leasing company that leased containers owned by us to container shipping lines. We were originally incorporated under the name Container Applications International, Inc. in the State of Nevada in August 1989. In February 2007, we were reincorporated under our present name in the State of Delaware.
Corporate Information
Our corporate headquarters and principal executive offices are located at Steuart Tower, 1 Market Plaza, Suite 2400, San Francisco, California 94105. Our telephone number is (415) 788-0100 and our website address is www.capps.com. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, nor does it form a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any other document that we file with the SEC. 
Segment Information
We operate under one reportable segment, container leasing, which is aggregated with equipment management and derives its revenue from the ownership and leasing of containers and fees earned for managing container portfolios on behalf of third-party investors.
We sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our logistics business and our remaining railcar fleet during the year ended December 31, 2020. The operations of the logistics and rail leasing businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As a result, we no longer report Logistics or Rail Leasing as segments.
Industry Overview
Container Leasing
We operate in the worldwide intermodal freight container leasing industry. Intermodal freight containers, or containers, are large, standardized steel boxes used to transport cargo by a number of means, including ship, truck and rail. Container shipping lines use containers as the primary means for packaging and transporting freight internationally, principally from export-oriented economies in Asia to other Asian countries, North America and Western Europe.
Containers are built in accordance with standard dimensions and weight specifications established by the International Standards Organization (ISO). Standard dry van containers are eight feet wide, either 20 or 40 feet long and are either 8 feet 6 inches or 9 feet 6 inches tall. 
The three principal categories of containers are as follows:
Dry van containers. A dry van container is constructed of steel sides, roof and end panel with a set of doors on the other end, a wooden floor and a steel undercarriage. Dry van containers are the least expensive and most commonly used type of container. They are used to carry general cargo, such as manufactured component parts, consumer staples, electronics and apparel.
Refrigerated containers. A refrigerated container has an integrated refrigeration unit on one end, which plugs into a generator set or other outside power source and is used to transport perishable goods.
Specialized equipment. Specialized equipment includes open-top, flat-rack, palletwide and swapbody containers, roll trailers, and generator sets. An open-top container is similar in construction to a dry van container except that the roof is replaced with a tarpaulin supported by removable roof bows. A flat-rack container is a heavily reinforced steel platform with a wood deck and steel end panels. Open-top and flat-rack containers are generally used to move heavy or oversized cargo, such as marble slabs, building products or machinery. Palletwide containers are a type of dry-van container externally similar to ISO standard containers, but internally about two inches wider so as to accommodate two European-sized pallets side-by-side. Swapbody containers are a type of dry van container designed to be easily transferred between rail, truck, and barge and are equipped with legs under their frames. Roll trailers are a type of flat-bed trailer equipped with rubber wheels underneath for terminal haulage and stowage on board roll-on/roll-off vessels. Generator sets are units that are attached to refrigerated containers to provide the container with cooling.
Containers provide a secure and cost-effective method of transportation because they can be used in multiple modes of transportation, making it possible to move cargo from a point of origin to a final destination without repeated unpacking and repacking. As a result, containers reduce transit time and freight and labor costs as they permit faster loading and unloading of shipping vessels and more efficient utilization of transportation containers than traditional bulk shipping methods. The protection provided by containers also reduces damage, loss and theft of cargo during shipment. While the life of containers varies based upon the damage and normal wear and tear suffered by a container, we estimate that the average useful life of a dry van container used in our fleet is 13.0 years, and 12.0 years for a refrigerated container.
‎



Container shipping lines own and lease containers for their use. The Container Census & Leasing, Survey and Forecast of Global Container Units (2020/2021 Annual Report), published by Drewry Maritime Research, estimates that as of the end of 2019, transportation companies (including container shipping lines and freight forwarders) and container leasing companies owned approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the total worldwide container fleet, measured in TEUs. Given the uncertainty and variability of export volumes and the fact that container shipping lines have difficulty in accurately forecasting their container requirements at different ports, the availability of containers for lease significantly reduces a container shipping line’s need to purchase and maintain excess container inventory. In addition, container leases allow the container shipping lines to adjust their container fleets both seasonally and over time and help to balance trade flows. The flexibility offered by container leasing helps container shipping lines improve their overall fleet management and provides the container shipping lines with an alternative source of financing. 
Fleet Overview. The table below summarizes the composition of our container fleet as of December 31, 2020 by type of equipment:


 | Dry Van | Percent of | Refrigerated | Percent of | Specialized | Percent of | | Percent of 
 | Containers | Total Fleet | Containers | Total Fleet | Equipment | Total Fleet | Total | Total Fleet
Owned container fleet in TEUs | 1,539,801 | 88% | 61,801 | 4% | 86,749 | 5% | 1,688,351 | 97% 
Managed container fleet in TEUs | 50,521 | 3% | 328 | - | 5,449 | - | 56,298 | 3%

Managed container fleet in CEUs | 44,839 | 2% | 1,148 | - | 25,331 | 2% | 71,318 | 4% 
Total container fleet in CEUs | 1,408,166 | 78% | 223,755 | 12% | 166,599 | 10% | 1,798,520 | 100% 


Marketing and Operations Overview. Our marketing and operations personnel are responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with our lessees, facilitating lease contracts and maintaining the day-to-day coordination of operational issues. This coordination allows us to negotiate lease contracts that satisfy both our financial return requirements and our lessees’ operating needs. It also facilitates our awareness of lessees’ potential equipment shortages and their awareness of our available equipment inventories. We have marketing and operations employees in ten countries, supported by independent agents in a further seven countries.
Leases Overview. To meet the needs of our lessees and achieve a favorable utilization rate, we lease containers under three main types of leases:
Long-Term Leases. Our long-term leases have terms of one year or more and specify the number of containers to be leased, the pick-up and drop-off locations, the applicable per diem rate and the contract term. We typically enter into long-term leases for a fixed term ranging from three to eight years, with five-year leases being most common, although recently we have seen a trend towards longer term leases. Our long-term leases generally require our lessees to maintain all units on lease for the duration of the lease, which provides us with scheduled lease payments and predictable, recurring revenue. A small percentage of our long-term leases contain early termination options and afford the lessee interchangeability of containers, and the ability to redeliver containers if the lessee’s fleet requirements change. Generally, leases with an early termination provision impose various economic penalties on the customer if the customer elects to exercise the early termination provision. 
Short-Term Leases. Short-term leases include both master interchange leases and customized short-term leases. Master interchange leases provide a master framework pursuant to which lessees can lease containers on an as-needed basis, and thus command a higher per diem rate than long-term leases. The terms of master interchange leases are typically negotiated on an annual basis. Under our master interchange leases, lessees know in advance their per diem rates and drop-off locations, subject to monthly port limits. We also enter into other short-term leases that typically have a term of less than one year and are generally used for one-way leasing, typically for small quantities of containers. The terms of short-term leases are customized for the specific requirements of the lessee. Short-term leases are sometimes used to reposition containers to high-demand locations and accordingly may contain terms that provide incentives to lessees. 
Finance Leases. Finance leases provide our lessees with an alternative method to finance their container acquisitions. Finance leases are long-term in nature and require relatively little customer service attention. They ordinarily require fixed payments over a defined period and generally provide lessees with a right to purchase the leased containers for a nominal amount at the end of the lease term. Per diem rates under finance leases include an element of repayment of capital and, therefore, typically are higher than per diem rates charged under long-term leases. Finance leases require the container lessee to keep the container on lease for the entire term of the lease. 

‎



The following table provides a summary of our container fleet by lease type as of December 31, 2020: 


 | As of December 31, 2020
 | TEUs | | CEUs
Long-term leases | | 68% | | 68% 
Short-term leases | | 8% | | 8% 
Finance leases | | 24% | | 24% 
Total | | 100% | | 100%



Our lease agreements contain general terms and conditions detailing standard rights and obligations, including requirements that lessees pay a per diem rate, depot charges, taxes and other charges when due, maintain equipment in good condition, return equipment in good condition in accordance with return conditions set forth in the lease agreement, use equipment in compliance with all applicable laws, and pay us for the value of the equipment as determined by the lease agreement if the equipment is lost or destroyed. A default clause in our lease agreements gives us certain legal remedies in the event that an equipment lessee is in breach of lease terms.
Our lease agreements contain an exclusion of warranties clause and require lessees to defend and indemnify us in most instances from third-party claims arising out of the lessee’s use, operation, possession or lease of the equipment. Lessees are required to maintain physical damage and comprehensive general liability insurance, or be adequately self-insured, and to indemnify us against loss with respect to the equipment. We also maintain our own contingent physical damage and third-party liability insurance that covers our equipment during both on-lease and off-lease periods. All of our insurance coverage is subject to annual deductible provisions and per occurrence and aggregate limits.
Management Services Overview. We manage containers for third-party investors under management agreements that cover portfolios of containers. We lease, re-lease and dispose of the containers and contract for their repair, repositioning and storage. Our management agreements have multiple year terms and provide that we receive a management fee based upon the net operating income for each container, which is equal to the rental revenue for a container less the operating expenses directly attributable to that container. Management fees are collected monthly or quarterly, depending upon the agreement, and generally are not paid if net operating revenue is zero dollars or less for a particular period. If operating expenses exceed revenue, third-party investors are required to pay the excess, or we may deduct the excess, including our management fee, from future net operating revenue. Under these agreements, we also receive a commission for selling or otherwise disposing of containers for the third-party investor. Sales of containers typically have to be approved by the third-party investor. 
Our management agreements generally require us to indemnify the third-party investor for liabilities or losses arising out of a breach of our obligations. In return, the third-party investor typically indemnifies us in our capacity as the manager of the container against a breach by the third-party investor, sales taxes on commencement of the arrangement, withholding taxes on payments to the third-party investor under the management agreement and any other taxes, other than our income taxes, incurred with respect to the containers that are not otherwise included as operating expenses deductible from revenue.
Re-leasing, Logistics Management and Depot Management. We believe that managing the period after lease termination, in particular after our containers’ first lease, is one of the most important aspects of our business. Successful management of this period requires disciplined re-leasing capabilities, logistics management and depot management.
Re-leasing. Since our leases generally allow our lessees to return their containers, we typically lease a container several times during its useful life. New containers can usually be leased with a limited marketing and customer service infrastructure because initial leases for new containers typically cover large volumes of units and are fairly standardized transactions. Used containers, on the other hand, are typically leased in smaller transactions that are structured to accommodate pick-ups and returns in a variety of locations. Our utilization rates depend on our re-leasing abilities. Factors that affect our ability to re-lease used containers include the size of our lessee base, ability to anticipate lessee needs, our presence in relevant geographic locations and the level of service we provide our lessees. We believe that our global presence and long-standing relationships with approximately 360 container lessees as of December 31, 2020 provide us an advantage over our smaller competitors in re-leasing our used containers.
Logistics Management. The shipping industry is characterized by large regional trade imbalances, with loaded containers generally flowing from export-oriented economies in Asia to other Asian countries, North America and Western Europe. Because of these trade imbalances, container shipping lines have an incentive to return leased containers in relatively low export areas to reduce the cost of shipping empty containers. We have managed this structural imbalance of inventories with the following approach:

Limiting or prohibiting container returns to low-demand areas. In order to minimize our repositioning costs, our leases typically include a list of the specific locations to which containers may be returned, limitations on the number of containers that may be returned to low-demand locations, high drop-off charges for returning containers to low-demand locations or a combination of these provisions;

Taking advantage of the secondary resale market. In order to maintain a younger fleet age profile, we have aggressively sold older containers when they are returned to low demand areas;

Developing country-specific leasing markets to utilize older containers in the portable storage market. In North America and Western Europe, we lease older containers on a limited basis for use as portable storage;

Seeking one-way lease opportunities to move containers from lower demand locations to higher demand locations. One-way leases may include incentives, such as free days, credits and damage waivers. The cost of offering these incentives is considerably less than the cost we would incur if we paid to reposition the empty containers; and

Paying to reposition our containers to higher demand locations. At locations where our inventories remain high, despite the efforts described above, we will selectively choose to ship excess containers to locations with higher demand.

Depot Management. As of December 31, 2020, we managed our equipment fleet through approximately 180 independent equipment depot facilities located in 39 countries. Depot facilities are generally responsible for repairing containers when they are returned by lessees and for storing the containers while they are off-hire. Our operations group is responsible for managing our depot contracts and periodically visiting depot facilities to conduct inventory and repair audits. We also supplement our internal operations group with the use of independent inspection agents. As of December 31, 2020, a majority of our off-lease inventory was located at depots that are able to report notices of container activity and damage detail via electronic data interchange. 
Most of our depot agency agreements follow a standard form and generally provide that the depot will be liable for loss or damage of containers and, in the event of loss or damage, will pay us the previously agreed loss value of the applicable containers. The agreements require the depots to maintain insurance against container loss or damage and we carry insurance to cover the risk that a depot’s insurance proves insufficient.
Our container repair standards and processes are generally managed in accordance with standards and procedures specified by the Institute of International Container Lessors, or the IICL. The IICL establishes and documents the acceptable interchange condition for containers and the repair procedures required to return damaged containers to acceptable interchange condition. When containers are returned by lessees, the depot arranges an inspection of the containers to assess the repairs required to return the containers to acceptable IICL condition. As part of the inspection process, damages are categorized either as lessee damage or normal wear and tear. Items typically designated as lessee damage include dents in the container, while items such as rust are typically designated as normal wear and tear. In general, lessees are responsible for the lessee damage portion of repair costs and we are responsible for normal wear and tear. 
Customer Concentration. Billings from our ten largest container lessees represented 62.5% of total billings for the year ended December 31, 2020, with billings from our two largest lessees, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A. and CMA CGM, accounting for 17.1% and 10.2%, respectively, of total billings, or $69.8 million and $41.6 million, respectively. 
Proprietary Real-time Information Technology System. Our proprietary real-time information technology system tracks all of our containers individually by container number, provides design specifications for the containers, tracks on-lease and off-lease transactions, matches each on-lease unit to a lease contract and each off-lease unit to a depot contract, maintains the major terms for each lease contract, tracks accumulated depreciation, calculates the monthly bill for each container lessee and tracks and bills for container repairs. Most of our depot activity is reported electronically, which enables us to prepare container lessee bills and calculate financial reporting information more efficiently.
In addition, our system allows our lessees to conduct business with us through the Internet. This allows our lessees to review our container inventories, monitor their on-lease information, view design specifications and receive information on maintenance and repair. Many of our lessees receive billing and on- and off-lease information from us electronically.
Our Suppliers. We purchase most of our containers in China from manufacturers that have met our qualification requirements. We are currently not dependent on any single manufacturer. We have long-standing relationships with all of our major container suppliers. Our technical services personnel review the designs for our containers and periodically audit the production facilities of our suppliers. In addition, we contract with independent third-party inspectors to monitor production at factories while our containers are being produced. This provides an additional layer of quality control and helps ensure that our containers are produced in accordance with our specifications.
Our Competition. We compete primarily with other global container leasing companies, including both larger and smaller lessors. We also compete with bank leasing companies who offer long-term operating leases and finance leases, and container shipping lines, which sometimes lease their excess container inventory. Other participants in the shipping industry, such as container manufacturers, may also decide to enter the container leasing business. It is common for container shipping lines to utilize several leasing companies to meet their container needs and to minimize reliance on any one individual leasing company.

Our competitors compete with us in many ways, including pricing, lease flexibility, supply reliability, customer service and the quality and location of containers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, better access to capital, lower cost of capital, better credit ratings, more containers, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with lessees, longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition and greater marketing resources than us, or are affiliates of larger companies. We emphasize the quality of our fleet, supply reliability and high level of customer service to our container lessees. We focus on ensuring adequate container availability in high-demand locations, dedicate large portions of our organization to building relationships with lessees, maintain close day-to-day coordination with lessees and have developed a proprietary information technology system that allows our lessees to access real-time information about their containers.
Seasonality. We have historically experienced increased seasonal demand for containers in the second and third quarters of the year. However, equipment rental revenue may fluctuate significantly in future periods based upon the level of demand by container shipping lines for leased containers, our ability to maintain a high utilization rate of containers in our total fleet, and changes in per diem rates for leases.
Credit Control
We provide services for container shipping lines, freight forwarders, and other companies that meet our credit criteria. Our credit policy sets different maximum exposure limits depending on our relationship and previous experience with each customer. Credit criteria may include, but are not limited to, trade route, country, business climate, social and political climate, assessments of net worth, asset ownership, bank and trade credit references, credit bureau reports (including those produced specifically for the maritime sector by Dynamar), operational history and financial strength. We monitor our customers’ performance on an ongoing basis. Our credit control processes are aided by the long payment experience we have with most of our customers, our broad network of relationships that provide current information about our customers’ market reputations and our focus on collections.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner or operator of equipment may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from the equipment without regard to the fault of the owner or operator. While we typically maintain liability insurance coverage and typically require our lessees to provide us with indemnity against certain losses, the insurance coverage is subject to large deductibles, limits on maximum coverage and significant exclusions and may not be sufficient or available to protect against any or all liabilities and such indemnities may not cover or be sufficient to protect us against losses arising from environmental damage.
Regulation
Our container operations are subject to regulations promulgated in various countries, including the United States, seeking to protect the integrity of international commerce and prevent the use of equipment for international terrorism or other illicit activities. For example, the Container Security Initiative, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and Operation Safe Commerce are among the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that are designed to enhance security for cargo moving throughout the international transportation system by identifying existing vulnerabilities in the supply chain and developing improved methods for ensuring the security of containerized cargo entering and leaving the United States. Moreover, the International Convention for Safe Containers, 1972, as amended (CSC), adopted by the International Maritime Organization, applies to new and existing containers and seeks to maintain a high-level of safety of human life in the transport and handling of containers by providing uniform international safety regulations. As these regulations develop and change, we may incur increased compliance costs due to the acquisition of new, compliant equipment and/or the adaptation of existing equipment to meet new requirements imposed by such regulations. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.
Human Capital Management
We seek to attract, retain, and develop the best talent available in order to drive our continued success and achieve our business goals. Our container leasing workforce as of December 31, 2020 was comprised of 99 employees worldwide, 48% of which are located outside the U.S. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. Our workforce decreased 51% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to the sale of the logistics business. Excluding Logistics and Rail employees, voluntary workforce turnover for the year was 3%.‎

 


The success of our employees drives the success of the business, and supports our goal of long-term value creation for our stockholders. We strive for an inclusive and respectful work environment where employees are empowered at all levels to implement new ideas to better serve our global customer base and continuously improve our processes and operations. We believe that we offer competitive benefits and training programs to develop employees’ expertise and skillsets, use training, communication, appropriate investments and clear corporate policies to strive to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment guided by principles of fair and equal treatment, and prioritize employee engagement. As a result, we believe our employees are committed to building strong, innovative and long-term relationships with each other and with our local communities and customer base. 
We are committed to diversity and inclusion across our Company, and one of our goals is to increase diverse talent across our leadership. As of December 31, 2020, our global workforce self-identified as 31% male and 69% female. In the U.S., 48% of our workforce was comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. As of February 28, 2021, our board of directors consisted of 33% directors identifying as either female or a minority. Our commitment to diversity recruiting includes partnering with external organizations to develop a diverse talent pipeline, applying a diverse slate approach to increase diversity within our executive management team and developing policies and initiatives aimed at further promoting diversity and inclusion in our organization. To attract diversity in our applicant pools, we post our openings to a wide variety of job boards and deploy appropriate language in our postings.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management. A majority of our workforce worked remotely beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing into 2021 without significant impacts to productivity, and we instituted reduced office capacity, upgraded cleaning practices, social distancing requirements and other safety measures and procedures for those employees who worked at our office locations during this time. We have put into place other health and safety measures globally to enable our operations to continue without significant impact. We did not furlough or conduct any employee layoffs due to the pandemic during the year.
