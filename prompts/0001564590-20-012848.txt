Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering treatments for autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases, which we collectively refer to as autoimmune diseases. Our approach seeks to redefine the treatment of autoimmune diseases by focusing on critical biological pathways shared across multiple diseases. We believe that this approach, which targets the underlying molecular pathogenesis of the disease, allows us to develop more precise therapies, identify patients more likely to respond to treatment and pursue multiple indications for each of our product candidates. Our lead product candidate, inebilizumab, is a humanized monoclonal antibody, or mAb, designed to target CD19, a molecule expressed on the surface of a broad range of immune system B cells. In January 2019, we reported positive pivotal clinical trial data for inebilizumab in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD. NMOSD is a rare, devastating condition that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain stem, and often leads to irreversible blindness and paralysis. We received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of this disease from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in April 2019 and in August 2019, the FDA accepted for review our Biologics License Application, or BLA for inebilizumab. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA date of June 11, 2020. In addition, we have a broad pipeline of two additional clinical and two pre-clinical stage product candidates focused on a number of other autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs, including myasthenia gravis, IgG4-related disease, Sjögren’s syndrome and lupus, as well as other conditions such as kidney transplant rejection. In December 2019, we initiated a Phase 2b trial of VIB4920, for the treatment of Sjögren’s syndrome. 
 Our pipeline is currently focused on the following shared critical biological pathways of autoimmune diseases: 
  
• | Production of autoantibodies: the autoantibody pathway. A number of autoimmune diseases, including NMOSD, myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease, and other conditions such as kidney transplant desensitization, are associated with autoantibodies secreted by a subset of immune B cells known as plasmablasts and plasma cells. These autoantibodies attack native tissues as opposed to foreign pathogens. Our lead product candidate, inebilizumab, is designed to target and deplete CD19-expressing B cells, which may reduce autoantibodies that are implicated in these autoimmune diseases and other conditions.

• | Immune overactivation through co-stimulatory pathways: the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway. A number of autoimmune diseases, including Sjögren’s syndrome, and other conditions such as kidney transplant rejection, are associated with overactivation of immune cells through cell-cell, or co-stimulatory, interactions. CD40 ligand, or CD40L, is a soluble or surface-bound protein expressed on T cells that interacts with CD40, a receptor protein expressed on a variety of immune cells such as B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. The overstimulation of these immune cells triggered by the interaction of CD40 and CD40L, or CD40/CD40L, leads to an immune response cascade and overproduction of molecules that mediate inflammation, resulting in the development of numerous autoimmune diseases. Our second product candidate, VIB4920, is a fusion protein designed to target CD40L, blocking CD40L’s interaction with CD40 and other binding partners, and thereby potentially decreasing autoimmune and inflammatory responses. VIB4920 has been designed to avoid thromboembolic side effects observed with an earlier generation CD40L mAb.

• | Overactivation of the innate immune system: the innate cytokine pathway. A number of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, are associated with the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs. pDCs are a type of innate immune cell that can produce large amounts of cytokines, including type I interferons, IL-6 and TNF-a, in response to immune stimuli such as viral infection, immune complexes and cell debris. Our third product candidate, VIB7734, is designed to target and bind to an immunoglobulin-like transcript, or ILT7, which is a cell surface molecule specific to pDCs, leading to their depletion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the three pathways listed above, we are continuing to explore other critical shared biological pathways that we believe are implicated in autoimmune disease pathogenesis.

Our Pipeline 
 We are leveraging our critical biological pathway approach to develop a broad pipeline of product candidates across multiple diseases, which we refer to as indications. The following table summarizes our pipeline: 
Inebilizumab. We are initially developing inebilizumab as a potential first-line monotherapy for NMOSD. In January 2019, we announced positive topline data from our N-MOmentum pivotal trial in a broad patient population that included AQP4 antibody positive, or AQP4+, and AQP4 antibody negative, or AQP4-, patients with various degrees of disease severity based on the number of previous attacks. AQP4+ patients, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to a water channel protein called aquaporin-4, or AQP4, are thought to represent approximately 80% of the NMOSD patient population. Inebilizumab is designed to be dosed with two initial doses on days 1 and 15, followed by dosing every six months thereafter, which is a significantly less frequent dosing regimen compared to other therapies that have been approved or are in clinical development. The trial met its primary and a majority of secondary endpoints, and in May 2019, we presented detailed trial data at the plenary session of the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. Based on the results of the N-MOmentum trial, we submitted a BLA to the FDA in June 2019, which the FDA accepted for review in August 2019. The FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for inebilizumab for the treatment of patients with NMOSD in February 2016 and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in April 2019 and in August 2019, the FDA accepted for review our Biologics License Application, or BLA for inebilizumab. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA date of June 11, 2020. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted orphan designation to inebilizumab for the treatment of NMOSD in March 2017.

If we obtain approval from the FDA of inebilizumab as a monotherapy for NMOSD, we intend to focus our commercial efforts initially on the United States market, which we believe represents the largest market opportunity, as we estimate that there are approximately 10,000 patients with NMOSD. We are currently building our internal commercialization capabilities that we expect will initially be supplemented by fewer than 30 clinical sales representatives targeting a small number of medical centers of excellence, where approximately 70% of all patients with NMOSD in the United States are treated. For markets outside the United States, we intend to seek to enter into arrangements with third parties to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of inebilizumab for the treatment of patients with NMOSD. In May 2019, we entered into a collaboration with Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Limited, or Hansoh Pharma, for co-development and commercialization of inebilizumab in patients with NMOSD and other autoimmune diseases and hematological cancers in China, Hong Kong and Macau, and in October 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC, for co-development and commercialization of inebilizumab in Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. 
 VIB4920. VIB4920 is a fusion protein designed to bind to CD40L on activated T cells, blocking their interaction with CD40-expressing B cells and potentially other binding partners. This is intended to prevent B cells from differentiating into plasma cells and memory B cells. Blocking CD40 and CD40L interaction can also inhibit stimulation of dendritic cells and monocytes by T cells, which reduces production of pro-inflammatory mediators. We believe that these combined effects have the potential to produce powerful immunomodulation for the targeting of both T and B cell-driven diseases. 
 Two Phase 1 clinical trials of VIB4920 have been completed to date: a Phase 1a single-ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers and a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In both trials, VIB4920 was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of platelet aggregation that resulted in thromboembolic side effects with an earlier generation CD40L mAb. In the Phase 1b trial, VIB4920 decreased disease activity in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority of patients achieved low-level disease activity or remission at the two highest dose levels. We believe that the dose-dependent reduction in autoantibody levels coupled with the clinical activity observed in rheumatoid arthritis suggest that VIB4920 may effectively block the CD40/CD40L interaction. We have selected two diseases associated with immune overactivation through CD40L as the initial diseases to further evaluate in VIB4920 trials. A Phase 2b trial in Sjögren’s syndrome, which is designed as Phase 3-enabling, is now ongoing and in 2019, we initiated a separate Phase 2 trial in kidney transplant rejection. We also plan to initiate additional clinical trials in other diseases associated with the same pathway in 2020. 
 VIB7734. VIB7734 is a humanized mAb intended to be a novel treatment for autoimmune diseases where the pathology is driven principally by overproduction of type I interferons and other cytokines secreted by pDCs. VIB7734 is designed to target and bind to ILT7, a cell surface molecule specific to pDCs, leading to their depletion. pDCs generate large amounts of interferons in pathological states. The depletion of pDCs may also decrease other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6, which are critical to the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune diseases. We have completed a Phase 1a single-ascending dose trial in patients with any one of the following six autoimmune diseases: SLE, CLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The Phase 1a trial demonstrated that VIB7734 was generally well-tolerated and reduced pDC levels. Our ongoing Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial includes a cohort of patients with the same diseases as well as separate cohorts of patients with CLE in the presence or absence of SLE. The CLE cohorts will be the basis of an interim data analysis planned for the second quarter of 2020. Assuming this trial is able to establish proof of concept, we intend, subject to regulatory feedback, to progress to Phase 2 clinical trials in other diseases that are also driven by interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines secreted by pDCs. 
 Pre-clinical Development. We are also conducting pre-clinical research and development on two product candidates. The first candidate, VIB1116, is a mAb designed to decrease the number and function of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. We expect to conduct pre-clinical toxicology studies in the first half of 2020 to enable a submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND. The second candidate is a mAb cytokine fusion protein designed to inhibit inflammatory responses. We are currently conducting pre-clinical efficacy studies of this candidate in animal models. 
Our Team and Corporate History 
 We have an experienced internal research and development team focused on utilizing our deep understanding of autoimmune disease pathways to discover and develop novel therapies that more precisely target these pathways. Our founding management team, as well as a significant portion of our research and development team, joined us from MedImmune, the biologics division of AstraZeneca, where they played key roles in the autoimmune disease area and in the development of the product candidates in our existing portfolio. We believe this deep experience with and detailed technical knowledge of both the autoimmune disease area and our product candidates is a critical advantage for us. 
 Since our founding, we have expanded our team to incorporate additional expertise as needed to pursue our goal of becoming a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company. We have assembled key management team members with 
 5

expertise in autoimmune research, development, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, operations, manufacturing and commercialization. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Zhengbin (Bing) Yao, Ph.D., has more than 20 years’ experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, with a track record of leading the successful discovery and development of multiple approved biotherapeutics. Our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research and Development, Jörn Drappa, M.D., Ph.D., has more than 20 years’ experience in clinical development of multiple approved biotherapeutics for autoimmune and other diseases. Dr. Yao and Dr. Drappa have worked together for over a decade at other companies and other members of our management team have worked together in key positions at public companies that develop and commercialize therapies for autoimmune and other diseases. 
 We were incorporated in December 2017 and, in February 2018, we acquired six molecules from MedImmune, of which five constitute our current product candidates, for a purchase price of approximately $142.3 million financed by AstraZeneca’s purchase of our Series A preferred stock. Following the asset purchase, we entered into several agreements with AstraZeneca and MedImmune, including a license agreement, sublicense agreements, a master supply and development services agreement, a transition services agreement, a clinical supply agreement and a commercial supply agreement. Under our commercial supply agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca has agreed to provide us with commercial supplies of drug product for inebilizumab. We believe that our existing stock of drug substance that has already been manufactured will be sufficient to supply us for approximately the first two years of commercialization of inebilizumab in the United States, if we obtain FDA approval. See “—Licenses and Strategic Agreements—Clinical Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited” and “—Licenses and Strategic Agreements—Commercial Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited.”
Concurrent with our acquisition of these MedImmune assets, we also closed a $250 million Series A preferred stock financing with five institutional investors (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). In June 2019, we closed a Series B preferred stock financing with five new institutional investors and one existing institutional investor for aggregate gross proceeds of $75 million (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). In October 2019, we completed an initial public offering, or the IPO of our common stock and issued and sold 9,085,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $172.6 million.
 Our Strategy 
 Our vision is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company pioneering treatments for autoimmune diseases by focusing on critical biological pathways shared across multiple indications. Key components of our business strategy include the following: 

• | Obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize inebilizumab as a first-line monotherapy treatment for patients with NMOSD. We received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for inebilizumab for the treatment of NMOSD in April 2019, and in August 2019, the FDA accepted for review our BLA for inebilizumab. The FDA set a PDUFA date of June 11, 2020. If approved, we believe that we can effectively commercialize inebilizumab in the United States with a focused commercial team targeting a small number of medical centers of excellence that treat approximately 70% of the estimated 10,000 patients with NMOSD. In addition to our collaboration with Hansoh Pharma and MTPC, we are evaluating potential additional partnerships to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of inebilizumab in NMOSD in other geographic regions outside of the United States.

• | Expand the use of inebilizumab into additional diseases. With the positive data from our pivotal trial in NMOSD, which we believe validates inebilizumab’s mechanism of action of targeting the autoantibody pathway, we plan to expand the use of inebilizumab to other diseases where CD19-expressing B cells are believed to be key drivers of the disease pathogenesis. Based on our extensive understanding of the autoantibody pathway, we plan to initiate clinical trials in myasthenia gravis, IgG4-related disease and kidney transplant desensitization. We initiated the first of these clinical trials in kidney transplant desensitization in 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance VIB4920 and VIB7734 through clinical development for multiple diseases with shared critical biological pathways. VIB4920 demonstrated proof of concept in rheumatoid arthritis in a Phase 1b trial. A Phase 2b trial in Sjögren’s syndrome, which is designed as Phase 3-enabling, is ongoing and in 2019, we initiated a separate Phase 2 trial in kidney transplant rejection. Both of these diseases are associated with immune overactivation through the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway. We also plan to initiate additional clinical trials in other diseases associated with the same pathway in 2020. VIB7734 is in an ongoing Phase 1b trial, with an interim dataanalysis in patients with CLE expected in the second quarter of 2020. Assuming this trial is able to establish proof of concept, we intend, subject to regulatory feedback, to move into Phase 2 clinical trials in diseases driven by interferons and other pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by pDCs.

• | Expand our clinical portfolio by initiating clinical trials of two pre-clinical product candidates. We are currently advancing two candidates through pre-clinical studies. For the first candidate, VIB1116, we expect to

conduct pre-clinical toxicology studies to enable a submission of an IND in the first half of 2020. The second candidate is currently in pre-clinical efficacy studies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discover and develop additional product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases utilizing our critical biological pathway approach. Our team has extensive experience in discovery research, deep expertise in immunology and a strong record of publication in high-impact peer-reviewed journals. The team is focused on understanding additional disease pathways associated with autoimmune disease, identifying key targets for intervention within these pathways and generating drug candidates against those targets. We may also in-license from or collaborate with third parties to develop drug candidates that we believe are promising therapeutic candidates.

Autoimmune Disease Overview 
 Autoimmune diseases result from an immune response directed against the body’s own healthy cells and tissues. According to a 2012 report from the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences, approximately 23.5 million people in the United States suffer from autoimmune diseases. In a significant subset of severe autoimmune diseases there remain substantial unmet medical needs, as patients are generally treated with broadly prescribed steroids and nonspecific immunosuppressive regimens. Current therapies are rarely considered curative and, even with modern standards of care, patients may suffer from chronic disease progression. There is a need for more targeted treatments with increased efficacy and decreased toxicity. 
 Autoimmune diseases usually involve autoreactive T cells and B cells, which can communicate through shared pathways, resulting in damage to the body’s cells and tissues. In a healthy individual, as the immune system develops during childhood, these T cells and B cells are eliminated or suppressed by various mechanisms. When any of these mechanisms fails, autoimmunity can arise. The presence of autoantibodies, a product of autoreactive B cells, is a hallmark of many of these diseases. Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by disease flares, in which symptoms worsen, followed by a period of remission, in which symptoms improve. Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by progressively worsening health status and life-altering disability. 
 Certain autoimmune diseases are not only due to the direct effects of autoantibodies, but also other mechanisms that cause immune dysfunction. These include activation of inflammatory T cells and cytotoxic T cells, which can cause inflammation and tissue damage. Cytokines released as a result of immune overactivation can further increase inflammatory tissue damage. Dysregulation of the same pathway can lead to a variety of symptoms, and multiple pathways may be dysregulated in any given autoimmune disease. 
 In many autoimmune diseases, existing therapy consists of long-term treatment with a combination of immunosuppressive agents and high-dose corticosteroids. These treatment regimens may result in increased rates of infection, increased risk of malignancy, and other side effects, including hypertension, diabetes and osteoporosis. Further, these currently available treatments often do not achieve adequate clinical responses. Targeted agents, such as TNF-a antagonists, are used to treat certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, after immunosuppressive agents have failed. However, these therapies are not effective in treating many autoimmune diseases and, consequently, there remains a substantial unmet medical need for more effective therapies.

Our Approach: Developing Therapies by Focusing on Shared Critical Biological Pathways of Autoimmune Diseases 
 We seek to redefine the treatment of autoimmune diseases by focusing on critical biological pathways shared across multiple diseases. We believe this approach permits us to develop novel therapies that more precisely target these pathways. We have initially focused on three pathways: the autoantibody pathway, the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway and the innate cytokine pathway, each of which we believe presents distinct mechanisms that drive autoimmune disease and can be targeted by our existing portfolio of product candidates. The following graphic illustrates each of these pathways and the molecules within these pathways that we are currently targeting. 
Autoantibody Pathway. In the autoantibody pathway, autoantibodies are secreted by a subset of immune system B cells known as plasmablasts and plasma cells. In certain cases, these autoantibodies are directly pathogenic. In addition, B cells may contribute to autoimmunity through other mechanisms such as antigen presentation or cytokine production. A number of autoimmune diseases are associated with the B cell-mediated autoantibody pathway, including NMOSD, myasthenia gravis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP. B cells also play an important role in kidney transplant desensitization and IgG4-related disease. 
 Our lead product candidate, inebilizumab, is designed to target these antibody-secreting cells by binding with high affinity to CD19 and depleting CD19-expressing B cells via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, or ADCP. CD19 is a molecule broadly expressed on B cells, including some antibody-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells. In contrast, the expression of CD20, another cell surface molecule expressed on B cells, is lost as B cells differentiate into plasmablasts and plasma cells. Unlike existing CD20 targeting therapies, inebilizumab also directly depletes CD19-expressing plasmablasts and some plasma cells, most of which are not able to be directly targeted by anti-CD20 mAbs. 
 8

CD40/CD40L Co-stimulatory Pathway. T cells interact with B cells, macrophages and endothelial cells through various co-stimulatory receptor-ligand interactions, including CD40/CD40L. CD40L is thought to be a component of immune responses involved in B cell activation, maturation and eventually antibody production. CD40L also mediates activation of macrophages, dendritic cells and stromal cells, including endothelial cells. A number of autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, ITP, SLE, type 1 diabetes and bullous pemphigoid, are associated with overactivation of the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway. This pathway may also be important in kidney transplant rejection and certain glomerular kidney diseases. Our second product candidate, VIB4920, is a fusion protein designed to target CD40L, blocking CD40L’s interaction with CD40 and potentially other binding partners, thereby potentially decreasing autoimmune and inflammatory responses. VIB4920 has been designed to avoid thromboembolic side effects observed with an earlier generation CD40L mAb. 
 Innate Cytokine Pathway. Specialized innate immune system cells called pDCs recognize and become activated by viral infection and immune complexes. Upon becoming activated, pDCs produce large amounts of innate cytokines such as type I interferons, IL-6 and TNFa and also help activate other arms of the immune system, including T cells and B cells. A number of autoimmune diseases, such as CLE, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis, are associated with the overproduction of these innate cytokines. Our third product candidate, VIB7734, is a humanized mAb designed to target and bind to ILT7 on pDCs, leading to their depletion. 
 Our Product Candidates 
 Inebilizumab: Our Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Patients with NMOSD and Additional Diseases that Share the Autoantibody Pathway 
 We are initially developing inebilizumab as a first-line monotherapy for NMOSD. NMOSD is a rare, severe, relapsing, neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain stem, often leading to blindness and paralysis. We designed our N-MOmentum pivotal trial to evaluate inebilizumab as a monotherapy across a broad range of disease severity and patients, including both AQP4+ and AQP4- patients. Inebilizumab is designed to be dosed with two initial doses on days 1 and 15, followed by dosing every six months thereafter, which is a significantly less frequent dosing regimen compared to other therapies that have been approved or are currently in clinical development. The FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for inebilizumab for the treatment of patients with NMOSD in February 2016 and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in April 2019. The EMA granted orphan designation to inebilizumab for the treatment of patients with NMOSD in March 2017. 
 In January 2019, we announced positive topline data from our N-MOmentum pivotal trial. The trial met its primary and a majority of secondary endpoints, and in May 2019, we presented detailed trial data at the plenary session of the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. The N-MOmentum trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, global registration trial that enrolled 231 patients with NMOSD, which is the largest controlled trial conducted in this indication. The primary analysis demonstrated a 77.3% reduction in the risk of developing an NMOSD attack in AQP4+ patients treated with inebilizumab monotherapy compared to placebo. Furthermore, secondary analyses demonstrated statistically significant reductions in worsening of disability, hospitalizations and new MRI lesions. Inebilizumab was generally well-tolerated, with an adverse event rate similar to placebo. Based on the results of the N-MOmentum trial, we submitted a BLA to the FDA in June 2019, which the FDA accepted for review in August 2019. The FDA set a PDUFA date of June 11, 2020.
 In addition to NMOSD, we initiated, or plan to initiate, pending the development of clinical study protocols and subject to regulatory feedback, multiple clinical trials of inebilizumab in other indications associated with CD19-expressing B cells, including: 
  
• | a Phase 2 trial in 2019 for kidney transplant desensitization, where high levels of alloantibodies in certain patients may preclude successful identification of a match and transplant commenced with screening of the first patient; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a pivotal trial in mid-year 2020 for myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors or muscle specific kinase and

• | a Phase 2b trial in mid-year 2020 for IgG4-related disease, a group of disorders marked by tumor-like swelling and fibrosis of affected organs, which may be caused by infiltration of CD19-expressing plasmablasts and plasma cells that generate IgG4 antibodies.

Mechanism of Action 
 A number of autoimmune diseases, including NMOSD, are associated with autoantibodies secreted by plasmablasts and some plasma cells. B cells may contribute to autoimmunity through other mechanisms such as antigen presentation or cytokine production. CD19 is a cell surface molecule broadly expressed on B cells, including some antibody-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells. Each of the graphics below illustrates a different role of CD19-expressing B cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and other inflammatory conditions. Graphic A shows the process by which B cells differentiate into antibody secreting cells, including plasmablasts and plasma cells. Graphic B reflects the process by which an antigen is presented by CD19-expressing B cells, which in turn activates T cells. Graphic C highlights the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, and the release of matrix metalloproteinases, or MMPs. 
 

10

In contrast, the expression of CD20, another cell surface molecule expressed on B cells, is lost as B cells differentiate into plasmablasts and plasma cells. As a result, existing therapies targeting CD20 do not directly target plasmablasts and plasma cells. The graphic below illustrates CD19’s broad expression as compared to CD20’s lack of expression as cells differentiate into plasmablasts and plasma cells.

Inebilizumab is a humanized, affinity-optimized, afucosylated immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that binds to CD19. The Fc portion of inebilizumab will recruit natural killer cells or macrophages, which deplete the CD19-expressing B cells through ADCC and ADCP. The depletion of CD19-expressing B cells may result in a reduction of autoantibodies, decreased antigen presentation and reduced pro- inflammatory mediators. In addition, the removal of fucose from the Fc results in approximately tenfold increased affinity to the Fc receptors and significantly enhances ADCC and ADCP. The antigen-binding properties of inebilizumab, including high affinity and slow internalization, are favorable for ADCC and ADCP-dependent mechanisms of action. 
 Background and Unmet Need 
 NMOSD 
 NMOSD is a unifying term for neuromyelitis optica, previously known as Devic’s disease, and related syndromes. NMOSD is a rare, severe, relapsing, neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain stem, and often leads to irreversible blindness and paralysis. AQP4+ patients are thought to represent approximately 80% of the NMOSD patient population. These AQP4-IgG autoantibodies, produced by plasmablasts and plasma cells, bind primarily to astrocytes in the central nervous system. Binding of AQP4-IgG antibodies to central nervous system cells is believed to trigger attacks, which can damage the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain stem. Loss of vision, paralysis, loss of sensation, bladder and bowel dysfunction, nerve pain and respiratory failure can all be manifestations of the disease. Each NMOSD attack leads to further damage and disability. NMOSD occurs more commonly in women and it may be more common in individuals of African and Asian descent. Currently, patients are treated with immunosuppressants, steroids and off-label use of rituximab in an effort to prevent NMOSD attacks. Patients experiencing an attack are treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG, and plasmapheresis. However, these treatments are known to cause adverse events that may lead to treatment discontinuation, and the benefits and risks of these off-label treatments in NMOSD remain uncertain. In June 2019, eculizumab from Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. received FDA approval for the treatment of adults with NMOSD.
 We estimate the prevalence of NMOSD to be approximately 1 to 5 per 100,000 in the United States, with an estimated 10,000 patients suffering from NMOSD as of 2016. In Japan, the prevalence of NMOSD was approximately 4.1 per 100,000, and we estimate that there were 5,000 patients suffering from the disease as of 2017. In several European countries, the prevalence of NMOSD was estimated to range from less than 1 to 7 per 100,000, and we estimate a patient population of approximately 8,000 as of 2013. 
 Other Potential Diseases 
 We are also pursuing the following additional diseases associated with CD19-expressing B cells for potential treatment with inebilizumab: 
 Desensitization of highly sensitized candidates for kidney transplant. Patients with high levels of alloantibodies waiting for a kidney transplant have a lower chance of getting a matching organ and overall worse clinical outcomes following transplant. Approximately 6.5% of the estimated 95,000 patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the United States are considered “sensitized” with a calculated panel-reactive antibodies score of 98% to 100%. We plan to explore the potential of inebilizumab, used alone or in combination with VIB4920, to reduce levels of alloantibodies in kidney transplant candidates in a proof of concept study. In 2019, we initiated screening of patients for a Phase 2 trial. 
 Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder caused by autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, muscle specific kinase or other acetylcholine receptor-related proteins in the post-synaptic muscle membrane. Its prevalence is estimated to be 20 per 100,000 in the United States, and based on this prevalence, we 
 11

estimate the patient population to be approximately 56,000. The underlying pathogenesis has a high degree of similarity to NMOSD in that autoantibodies secreted by plasmablasts and/or plasma cells play a key role and are thought to be directly pathogenic. Patients with myasthenia gravis are currently managed with off-label immunosuppressants or steroids, or with one recently approved treatment. We have submitted an IND for inebilizumab in myasthenia gravis, and plan to initiate a pivotal trial in mid-year 2020. 
 IgG4-related disease. This is a group of disorders marked by tumor-like swelling and fibrosis of affected organs, which may be caused by infiltration of CD19-expressing plasma cells that generate IgG4 antibodies. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, and a variety of organs can be affected, including the pancreas, salivary glands, retroperitoneum and kidneys. Patients with this disorder have increased levels of IgG4, and IgG4 levels tend to correlate with disease activity. The prevalence is not well defined. A small trial of rituximab has suggested clinical benefits of B cell depletion in this disease. We are preparing to study the potential of inebilizumab in the treatment of IgG4-related disease. We have submitted an IND for inebilizumab in IgG4-related diseases in 2020, and aim to initiate a Phase 2b trial in mid-year 2020. 
 Clinical Development 
 In May 2019, we announced detailed results from the N-MOmentum trial, our pivotal clinical trial for inebilizumab and the largest controlled trial ever conducted in NMOSD. The N-MOmentum trial was a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension period, evaluating the safety and efficacy of inebilizumab in adult patients with NMOSD. Key inclusion criteria were adult patients with NMOSD and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of ≤7.5 (8.0 with medical monitor approval) having either a history of at least one NMOSD attack requiring rescue therapy during the past year, or at least two attacks requiring rescue therapy during the two years before screening. AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative, AQP4+ and AQP4- patients were eligible for inclusion, with stratification based on serostatus. Eligible patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive intravenous doses of inebilizumab 300 mg or placebo, respectively, administered on days 1 and 15. Patients received oral corticosteroid (prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent) between days 1 and 14, tapered to day 21, to minimize risk of an attack while the pharmacological action of inebilizumab took effect. The randomized period for each patient was for a maximum of 197 days, or until occurrence of an adjudicated attack. The trial was designed to enroll patients until the earlier of the occurrence of 67 adjudicated NMOSD attacks or the randomization and dosing of 252 patients. Based on a recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, for the trial, enrollment was stopped at 231 patients and 43 adjudicated NMOSD attacks. Based on the results observed, the IDMC determined that exposing patients to the risk of placebo was no longer justified. All patients continued in a safety follow-up period for 12 months after administration of their last dose of inebilizumab. Patients completing the randomized controlled period were given the option to enter into an open-label extension of the trial in which all patients received inebilizumab every six months. The open-label extension is ongoing. 
 The primary endpoint was time from treatment initiation to occurrence of an NMOSD attack during the randomized controlled period. NMOSD attack diagnosis was standardized using 18 clinically meaningful criteria that were developed for the trial in consultation with the FDA and leading experts. Each attack was adjudicated by an independent blinded panel of experts in the treatment of NMOSD. The trial met the primary endpoint, with a statistically significant difference in the time to NMOSD attack in favor of inebilizumab over placebo. In the AQP4+ population, 11.2% (18/161) of the patients receiving inebilizumab had an attack, compared to 42.3% (22/52) of patients receiving placebo, representing a 77.3% risk reduction. In the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population which also included AQP4- patients, 12.1% (21/174) of the patients receiving inebilizumab had an attack, compared to 39.3% (22/56) of patients receiving placebo, representing a 72.8% risk reduction, as shown in the table below. 
 The trial enrolled a small number of AQP4- patients (n = 17), and very few attacks were observed in this population. As a result, no clear conclusions can be drawn with respect to the AQP4- population.

The Kaplan-Mejer graphics below illustrate the probability of a patient being NMOSD attack-free during the course of the N-MOmentum randomized control period in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients and the ITT patient populations. 
 

We also evaluated the following four secondary endpoints in the N-MOmentum randomized control period: worsening of the Expanded Disability Status Scale, or EDSS, score from baseline; change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score (by low-contrast Landolt C Broken Ring Chart, or LCVNB); cumulative total number of new MRI lesions and the number of NMOSD-related inpatient hospitalizations (longer than an overnight stay). These endpoints were assessed at the last visit of each patient during the randomized controlled period. The trial met three of the four secondary endpoints with statistical significance, as illustrated in the table below.

 Compared to patients who received placebo, we observed that a significantly smaller proportion of patients experienced a worsening from baseline of their EDSS score when treated with inebilizumab. Of patients treated with inebilizumab, 15.5% (27/174) experienced a worsening from baseline of their EDSS score, compared to 33.9% (19/56) of patients who received placebo. We also observed a significant reduction in the number of NMOSD-related inpatient hospitalizations for patients treated with inebilizumab compared to patients who received placebo (p = 0.01; rate ratio 0.286). In addition, the cumulative new MRI lesion count was significantly lower in patients treated with inebilizumab (79/174) compared to patients who received placebo (32/56) (p = 0.0034; rate ratio 0.566). We did not observe a significant difference in the change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score between the inebilizumab and placebo groups.

Inebilizumab effectively depleted peripheral B cells within four weeks to below 10% of the average baseline in the N-MOmentum randomized control period, as illustrated below. The mean B cell count did not rise above this threshold throughout the 197-day randomized controlled period of the trial.

In September 2019, interim data from the ongoing open-label extension was presented at the Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). 216 patients entered the open-label extension of the N-MOmentum trial following the conclusion of the randomized-control period. As of June 6, 2019, 192 patients remained in the open-label extension, with the most common reason for withdrawal being “other”, a category that includes, among others, events such as decisions by physicians to discontinue treatment for any reason and patient pregnancies. The probability of a patient being NMOSD attack-free at one-year during the combined period of both the randomized control period and the open-label extension through the data cut-off of October 26, 2018 was 84.7% for patients treated with inebilizumab from the start of the trial and 50.1% for the patients who were treated with placebo during the randomized control period and switched to inebilizumab during the open-label extension.
 Inebilizumab was generally well-tolerated in the randomized control period and the rates and types of treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, reported in patients receiving inebilizumab were broadly similar to TEAEs reported by patients receiving placebo, as illustrated below. Adverse events were reported in 71.8% (125/174) of the patients receiving inebilizumab and in 73.2% (41/56) of the patients receiving placebo in the randomized control period. Urinary tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, headache, fall, hypoesthesia, cystitis and eye pain were nominally more frequent in patients receiving inebilizumab. The incidence of serious adverse events, or SAEs, was 4.6% in patients receiving inebilizumab and 8.9% in patients receiving placebo during the randomized control period. No specific SAEs were reported in more than one patient and no deaths occurred throughout the randomized controlled period. Two deaths have been reported in the ongoing open-label period. One death occurred in a patient experiencing a myelitis attack and was considered unrelated to inebilizumab by the investigator. The second death was due to complications from mechanical ventilator-associated pneumonia in a patient who developed new neurological symptoms and seizures, the cause of which could not be definitively established. The possibility that the death was treatment-related could not be ruled out, and as a result, under the terms of the protocol for the trial, the death was assessed as treatment-related. The differential diagnosis of observed neurological symptoms and MRI lesions included atypical NMOSD attack, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.

The ongoing open-label phase of the N-MOmentum is designed to evaluate the longer-term efficacy and safety of inebilizumab. In the interim open-label extension safety data presented in September 2019, with a safety data cut-off of June 6, 2019, inebilizumab remained generally well-tolerated with the types of TEAEs consistent with that observed during the randomized control period. For patients who received at least one dose of inebilizumab during the combined period of both the randomized control period and the open-label extension through June 6, 2019, the incidence of SAEs after receiving inebilizumab was 16.0%. As discussed above, two deaths have been reported in the open-label period. As of June 6, 2019, adverse events occurring in greater than 10% of patients who received at least one dose of inebilizumab during the combined period of both the randomized control period and the open-label extension were UTI (22.2%), nasopharyngitis (16.4%), back pain (12.4%), infusion related reaction, or IRR (12.4%), arthralgia (11.6%) and headache (11.1%) after receiving inebilizumab. 
 Based on the positive results of the N-MOmentum trial, we submitted a BLA to the FDA in June 2019, which the FDA accepted for review in August 2019. The FDA set a PDUFA date of June 11, 2020.

VIB4920 
 VIB4920 is a fusion protein designed to bind to CD40L on activated T cells, blocking CD40L from interacting with CD40-expressing B cells and other binding partners. This is intended to prevent B cells from differentiating into plasma cells and memory B cells. Blocking CD40L can also inhibit stimulation of dendritic cells and monocytes by T cells, which reduces production of pro-inflammatory mediators. We believe that these combined effects produce powerful immunomodulation targeting of both T and B cell driven diseases. 
 Two Phase 1 clinical trials of VIB4920 have been completed to date: a Phase 1a single-ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers and a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a disease with well understood clinical endpoints enabling proof of clinical activity in a relatively small clinical trial. In both trials, VIB4920 was generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of platelet aggregation that can lead to thromboembolic side effects observed with an earlier generation CD40L mAb. In the Phase 1b trial, VIB4920 decreased disease activity in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, and the majority of patients achieved low level disease activity or remission at the two highest dose levels. We believe that the dose-dependent reduction in autoantibody levels coupled with the clinical activity observed in rheumatoid arthritis suggest that VIB4920 effectively blocks the CD40/CD40L interaction. A Phase 2b trial in Sjögren’s syndrome, which is designed as Phase 3-enabling, is ongoing and in 2019, we initiated a separate Phase 2 trial in kidney transplant rejection. Both of these diseases are associated with the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway, and we also plan to initiate additional studies in other diseases associated with the same pathway in 2020. 
 17

Mechanism of Action 
 The CD40/CD40L interaction plays a critical role in driving humoral immune responses and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including Sjögren’s syndrome, as well as other conditions such as kidney transplant rejection. CD40 is constitutively expressed on a variety of antigen presenting cells, including B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. CD40L is highly regulated and predominately expressed on activated T cells. CD40/CD40L interactions between B cells and activated T cells are essential for mounting effective humoral responses to T cell dependent antigens. The binding of VIB4920 to both soluble CD40L and CD40L expressed on the surface of activated T cells is intended to block CD40L from interacting with CD40-expressing B cells and other binding partners, preventing B cells from differentiating into plasma cells and memory B cells. Each of the graphics below illustrates different elements of the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway that VIB4920 is designed to inhibit. CD40 signaling is required for germinal center formation, somatic hypermutation and the generation of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, as illustrated in graphic A below. Engagement of CD40 on macrophages and dendritic cells leads to activation of these cells with ensuing production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines and MMPs, and upregulation of other co-stimulatory pathways, as illustrated in graphics B and C below. 
 
18

The potential benefits of targeting the CD40L/CD40 interaction in autoimmune diseases such as lupus nephritis and ITP have been suggested by previous clinical trials conducted by other companies using full antibodies directed at CD40L. However, the earlier generation CD40L mAb caused adverse thromboembolic side effects related to platelet aggregation due to crosslinking of anti-CD40L antibodies co-bound to platelet CD40L and FcgRIIa on adjacent platelets. To avoid complications associated with mAb-based targeting of CD40L, VIB4920 was designed as a novel CD40L binding protein comprised of two Tn3 proteins fused to human serum albumin. Tn3 is a small protein scaffold that does not possess an Fc domain and therefore is unlikely to induce adverse platelet responses. 
 Background and Unmet Medical Need for Sjögren’s Syndrome and Kidney Transplant Rejection 
 We are initially developing VIB4920 in parallel in two diseases: Sjögren’s syndrome and kidney transplant rejection. Sjögren’s syndrome is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands such as the lacrimal and salivary glands. The disease frequently leads to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) and xerostomia (dry mouth). Sjögren’s syndrome may occur with other autoimmune diseases, such as SLE or rheumatoid arthritis. Sjögren’s syndrome is estimated to affect 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, with an estimated one million people in the United States suffering from Sjögren’s syndrome. No treatments have been shown to alter the course of this disease. Supportive treatment is aimed at relieving dry mouth/dry eye symptoms. 
 Current regimens used to prevent rejection following kidney transplant commonly rely on a combination of CD28/B7 pathway blockade with belatacept and calcineurin inhibitors. While generally effective, these regimens are associated with slow deterioration of kidney function as a result of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. Literature and data from animal models support the hypothesis that blockage of the CD40/CD40L pathway may be effective in the prevention of transplant rejection. We plan to conduct a proof of concept study to test the hypothesis that VIB4920, when combined with belatacept, will result in similar or reduced rates of kidney transplant rejection in comparison to current calcineurin based regimens while avoiding the renal toxicity associated with calineurin inhibitors. 
 Clinical Development 
 We initiated a Phase 2 trial in kidney transplant rejection in 2019 and a separate Phase 2b trial in Sjögren’s syndrome is ongoing, the latter of which is designed to be Phase 3-enabling. Both of these conditions are associated with immune overactivation through the CD40/CD40L co-stimulatory pathway, and we plan to initiate additional studies in other diseases associated with the same pathway in 2020. 
Phase 1b Trial 
 In August 2018, we completed a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a disease with well understood clinical endpoints enabling proof of clinical activity in a relatively small clinical trial. Fifty-seven patients enrolled in the trial and were randomized into four sequential VIB4920 dose cohorts, with doses ranging from 75 mg to 1500 mg, or treated with placebo, given by intravenous infusion every other week for 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of post-treatment observation. All patients received a systemic immunosuppressant, methotrexate, or a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug as background therapy. 
 19

The primary endpoint of the Phase 1b trial was the safety and tolerability of VIB4920. Consistent with the Phase 1a trial, VIB4920 was generally well-tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, with diarrhea, hyperhidrosis, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection being the most common TEAEs reported. We observed a balanced distribution of TEAEs between placebo and the four treatment groups, as shown in the table below. No thromboembolic events or clinically significant coagulation lab abnormalities were observed. One life-threatening treatment-emergent serious adverse event occurred, which was determined to be unrelated to VIB4920.

In addition to safety and tolerability, clinical benefit with VIB4920 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was also evaluated. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints in the multiple ascending dose study in rheumatoid arthritis measured at week 12 included change in disease activity, as measured by changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP score, as well as biomarkers such as rheumatoid factor, or RF, autoantibodies, serum C-reactive protein, or CRP, and Vectra-DA score.
DAS28-CRP is a composite clinical disease activity scale used in assessing the disease activity score of rheumatoid arthritis which takes into account the number of swollen and tender joints, CRP levels and a patient global health assessment. In this trial, VIB4920 reduced disease activity quantified by DAS28-CRP score at the two highest doses, as shown in the graphic below. At week 12, the adjusted mean change from baseline of DAS28-CRP (standard error) was: -2.3 (0.3) in the VIB4920 1500 mg group, -2.2 (0.3) in the VIB4920 1000 mg group, -1.2 (0.3) in the VIB4920 500 mg group, 0.1 (0.4) in the VIB4920 75 mg group and -1.0 (0.3) in the placebo group. The effect of VIB4920 on DAS28-CRP was rapid, with reductions evident by day 15, after only a single dose of VIB4920. The reduction of disease activity as compared with placebo was both clinically and statistically meaningful in the groups receiving the highest two doses of VIB4920. Seventy-five percent of patients in the 1500 mg group and 50% of patients in the 1000 mg group achieved a DAS28-CRP score of 3.2 or less at week 12 indicating they achieved low disease activity or clinical remission in the trial, compared to 6.7% of the patients who received placebo. 
 
RFs are a family of autoantibodies produced against the Fc portion of IgG which are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis and are associated with poor prognosis. VIB4920 reduced RF titers at the 500, 1000 and 1500 mg dose levels. Reductions in RF titers from baseline were evident in response to VIB4920 as early as day 29, with the 1500 mg dose reducing RF titers by approximately 50% by day 85.

Vectra DA is a commercially available and validated biomarker panel which measures 12 biomarkers (adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, skeletal proteins, hormones, and acute phase proteins) and combines these parameters into a single score to assess the key mechanisms and pathways that drive rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. At day 85, Vectra DA multi-biomarker score was reduced in patients at the 1000 and 1500 mg VIB4920 dose levels (p = 0.018 and p = 0.001, respectively). The results of this clinical trial were published in a featured cover article in Science Translational Medicine. 
 In summary, VIB4920 decreased disease activity in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, with at least 50% and 75% of patients, respectively, achieving low disease activity or clinical remission in the two highest dose groups at Day 85. We believe that the observed dose-dependent decrease in autoantibody levels, together with the inhibition of T cell dependent antibody responses in healthy volunteers, as reported in our Phase 1a trial of VIB4920, suggests that VIB4920 may effectively block the CD40/CD40L interaction. 
 Phase 1a Trial 
 In May 2016, a Phase 1a, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose trial was completed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VIB4920 in healthy adults. Fifty-nine patients enrolled in the trial and were randomized into seven active treatment cohorts, with doses ranging from 3 mg to 3000 mg, or treated with placebo. The primary endpoint of the Phase 1a trial was to measure the incidence of TEAEs and TESAEs. VIB4920 was generally well-tolerated, with the most common TEAEs being nasopharyngitis, headache and diarrhea, and no TESAEs were observed. 
 VIB4920 also demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of T cell dependent antibody responses. In order to evaluate the ability of VIB4920 to influence humoral immune responses in healthy patients, the Phase 1a trial measured inhibition of an induced T cell dependent IgG antibody response to the neoantigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or KLH. We observed a 78% and 86% reduction in anti-KLH IgG antibody concentration in the VIB4920 1000 mg and 3000 mg cohorts, respectively, compared to placebo at day 43. In the highest VIB4920 dose group, 7 of 8 patients had undetectable titers of anti-KLH-IgG at day 43, suggesting near complete suppression of the humoral immune response by VIB4920. These data highlight the mechanism of action of VIB4920 and demonstrate its potential to suppress B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation.

 VIB7734 is a humanized mAb intended to be a novel treatment for autoimmune diseases where the pathology is driven principally by overproduction of type I interferons and other cytokines secreted by pDCs. VIB7734 is designed to target and bind to ILT7, a cell surface molecule specific to pDCs, leading to pDC depletion. pDCs generate the majority of type I interferons in pathological states. The depletion of pDCs may also decrease other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6, which are critical to the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune diseases. We have completed a Phase 1a single-ascending dose trial in patients with any one of the following six different autoimmune diseases: CLE, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The Phase 1a trial demonstrated that VIB7734 was generally well-tolerated and reduced pDC numbers in peripheral blood. Our ongoing Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial includes a cohort of patients with the same diseases as well as separate cohorts of patients with CLE in the presence or absence of SLE. The CLE cohorts will be the basis of an interim data analysis planned for the second quarter of 2020.

Mechanism of Action 
 In certain autoimmune diseases, once pDCs are activated, they secrete large amounts of cytokines, including type I interferons, as illustrated in graphic A below. pDC infiltration and the resulting accumulation in tissues has been observed in a number of autoimmune diseases and appears to correlate with disease activity. Additionally, pDCs are involved in antigen presentation to T cells leading to the activation of autoreactive T cells, as illustrated in graphic B below. VIB7734 is a human IgG1 lambda afucosylated mAb specific for ILT7, a cell surface molecule expressed only on pDCs. VIB7734 binds to ILT7 on the surface of pDCs, which leads to recruitment of macrophages and natural killer cells, thus inducing apoptosis and depletion of pDCs in vivo. The afucosylation of VIB7734 is designed to enhance the potency of VIB7734 for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against pDCs. We believe that depletion of pDCs will not only reduce type I interferons, but also other types of cytokines and mediators involved in a number of autoimmune diseases. Each of the graphics below illustrates different elements of the function of pDCs that VIB7734 is designed to deplete, with graphic A showing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and graphic B highlighting the antigen presenting process by pDCs to T cells. 
Background and Market Opportunity in Selected Autoimmune Diseases 
 VIB7734 has potential utility across multiple autoimmune diseases that are characterized by elevated type I interferon signatures. These include CLE, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and a subset of rheumatoid arthritis. The majority of these conditions can lead to significant morbidity and currently have no approved treatments. 
 Overexpression of type I interferons is consistently found in the majority of patients with SLE, a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the presence of a variety of autoantibodies and can involve multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys and central nervous system. The estimated number of people suffering from SLE in the United States was approximately 161,000 to 322,000 in 2011. Based on this, we estimate the prevalence of SLE in the United States to range between 49 to 100 per 100,000 individuals. Treatment of SLE still largely relies on corticosteroids and non-specific immunosuppressive drugs. 
 Infiltration of inflamed muscle tissue and overexpression of type I interferons have also been found in inflammatory myopathies, a group of conditions associated with inflammation of the muscles with resulting muscle weakness. We estimate that a subset of this group of myopathies, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, has a prevalence of approximately 5 to 22 per 100,000 individuals in the United States, and based on this prevalence, we estimate the patient population to be approximately 16,000 to 70,000. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies typically involves corticosteroids and nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs. 
 22

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with thickening and fibrosis of the skin, frequently also involving other organ systems such as the lungs, heart and kidneys. The prevalence of systemic sclerosis is estimated to be between 13.5 and 44.3 per 100,000 individuals in Europe and North America, and based on this prevalence, we estimate the patient population to be approximately 300,000. No treatments that alter the course of this disease are currently available, and patients are managed with supportive treatment for the various organ manifestations of this disease. 
 Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition involving inflammation and destruction of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Other organs such as joints, lungs and kidneys may be involved as well. Sjögren’s syndrome is estimated to have affected between 53,000 and 248,000 people in the United States in 2017. No treatments have been shown to alter the course of this disease. 
 Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease involving progressive inflammation and destruction of the joints. A subset of approximately 33% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to have elevated expression of interferon regulated genes. This subgroup also appears to have a poorer response to rituximab treatment. 
 Clinical Development 
 Ongoing Phase 1b Trial 
 In December 2018, we initiated a multiple ascending dose Phase 1b trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple subcutaneous doses of VIB7734 in a cohort of patients with any one of the following six different autoimmune diseases: CLE, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis. We intend to enroll 32 patients in the Phase 1b trial in three cohorts with 8 patients in cohort 1, and 12 patients each in cohorts 2 and 3. In cohort 1, patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive VIB7734 or matching placebo and in cohorts 2 and 3, patients diagnosed with CLE (with or without SLE) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VIB7734 or matching placebo. The primary endpoint of the Phase 1b trial is the incidence of TEAEs and TESAEs and adverse events with special interest. The key secondary endpoint for cohorts 2 and 3 in the trial is a measurement of the change from baseline in the CLE disease area and severity index activity score. An interim data analysis in CLE in cohorts 2 is planned for the second quarter of 2020, and cohorts 3 is planned for the second half of 2020. 
 Phase 1a Trial 
 In a completed Phase 1a trial, the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and immunogenicity of single subcutaneous doses of VIB7734 were evaluated in patients with any one of the following six different autoimmune diseases: CLE, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis. A total of 36 patients were enrolled and randomized across five cohorts to receive a single subcutaneous dose of VIB7734 or matching placebo, of which ten patients received placebo treatment. 
 VIB7734 was generally well-tolerated. Sixty-nine percent (18/26) of the patients treated with VIB7734 experienced at least one TEAE, with a majority of such TEAEs characterized as non-serious and deemed not related to VIB7734. The most frequent TEAEs in the patients treated with VIB7734 were infections, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. No VIB7734-related TESAEs were observed. The rates and types of TEAEs reported in patients receiving VIB7734 were broadly similar to TEAEs reported by patients receiving placebo. 
 After a single subcutaneous injection, drug exposure and pDC levels were measured periodically during the 85-day follow-up period. VIB7734 peak concentrations were observed 5 to 8 days post dose and levels increased in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing doses were associated with a non-linear reduction in pDCs. Median reduction of pDC levels by 57% was seen at the lowest dose of 1 mg, with median reductions of 90% observed in higher doses. Time to recovery of pDC levels appeared to be dose dependent. 
 Pre-clinical Programs 
 We are also conducting pre-clinical research and development on two other product candidates. The first candidate, VIB1116, is a mAb designed to decrease the number and function of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. We expect to conduct pre-clinical toxicology studies in the first half of 2020 to enable a submission of an IND application. The second candidate is a mAb cytokine fusion protein designed to inhibit inflammatory responses. We are currently conducting pre-clinical efficacy studies of this candidate in animal models.

We may also be required to pay fees of up to an aggregate of £330,000 per year related to license maintenance and manufacturing. 
 The term of the sublicense agreement will continue until the expiration or termination of MedImmune’s license agreement with Lonza in its entirety, or with respect to inebilizumab expressed using the 551 Cell Line and VIB7734 expressed using the 7734 Cell Line. The Lonza License Agreement will continue until terminated by MedImmune with six months’ notice. If we are not in breach of the sublicense, MedImmune shall, at our request, use reasonable efforts to assist us in obtaining a direct license from Lonza. 
 We may terminate the sublicense for any reason upon 30 days’ written notice to MedImmune. Either we or MedImmune may terminate the sublicense immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement without cure within 60 days of receiving written notice of the material breach from the other party. Either we or MedImmune can terminate the sublicense agreement in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 BioWa/Lonza Sublicense Agreement 
 Pursuant to a sublicense agreement dated February 23, 2018, with MedImmune, LLC, we have an exclusive sublicense (as between MedImmune and us) under the non-exclusive licenses granted to MedImmune under a license agreement with BioWa, Inc. and Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, dated November 4, 2013, the BioWa/Lonza license, to develop, commercialize, make, have made, use, import, have imported, export, have exported, sell, have sold, offer for sale and otherwise dispose any product containing or comprising VIB7734 expressed using the 7734 Cell Line in the field of the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of all human diseases, conditions or disorders. 
 Under the terms of the sublicense agreement and license agreement, we may be required to pay low to mid single-digit royalties on net sales of products containing or comprising VIB7734 expressed using the 7734 Cell Line that are owed to BioWa/Lonza under the BioWa/Lonza License Agreement. We may also be required to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $11 million related to clinical trials and submission and approval of regulatory drug applications. We may also be required to pay fees of up to an aggregate of £340,000 per year related to manufacturing. 
 The term of the sublicense agreement will continue until the expiration or termination of the BioWa/Lonza license in its entirety or with respect to a product containing VIB7734 expressed using the 7734 Cell Line. If we are not in breach of the sublicense, MedImmune shall, at our request, use reasonable efforts to assist us in obtaining a direct license from BioWa and Lonza. The term of the BioWa/Lonza license will continue on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the product in such country where the product is sold or (ii) if a product is not covered by a valid claim within the patent rights, 10 years following the date of first commercial sale in the country where sold. 
 We may terminate the sublicense for any reason upon 30 days’ written notice to MedImmune. MedImmune may terminate the sublicense immediately upon written notice if we (i) knowingly oppose or assist any third party in opposing the grant of letters patent or patent application that are part of the BioWa/Lonza license or (ii) dispute or knowingly assist any third party in disputing the validity of any patent or patent claims that are part of the BioWa/Lonza license. Either we or MedImmune may terminate the sublicense immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement without cure within 30 days of receiving written notice of the material breach from the other party, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 MedImmune Payment Agreement 
 Pursuant to a payment agreement with MedImmune Limited dated February 23, 2018, we are responsible for certain royalty payments MedImmune may be required to make to Medical Research Council, or MRC, under a license agreement dated January 7, 1997. MedImmune obtained a license to patents and technology for library cloning and phage screening owned by MRC that was used in the identification of VIB7734. We may be required to reimburse MedImmune for payments to MRC, or pay MRC directly if instructed to do so by MedImmune, for low single-digit royalties on the net invoice price of products comprising or containing VIB7734. 
 29

The reimbursement agreement expires when there can be no further actual or contingent payment obligations under the MRC license. The royalty term of the MRC license expires on a country-by-country basis ten years after the first commercial sale in that country. 
 Medical Affairs and Patient Advocacy 
 We are building a medical affairs team that will be engaged in furthering awareness of autoimmune disease and education of clinicians with respect to the clinical knowledge we have gained from our clinical trials. Our medical affairs team will also support investigator sponsored trials and research collaborations. Our patient advocacy team will focus on expanding our relationships with the patient advocacy community for NMOSD and for other autoimmune diseases. 
Commercial Opportunity and Commercialization Plan for Inebilizumab 
 The commercial opportunity for inebilizumab, as potentially the first FDA-approved monotherapy for the treatment of patients with NMOSD with one or more attacks, stems from its distinctive value proposition. We believe inebilizumab has the potential for disease modification by preventing the next NMOSD attack through depletion of B cells and plasma cells. In addition, pivotal clinical trial data suggests that inebilizumab reduces the worsening of disability, hospitalizations and new MRI lesions. 
 NMOSD is a rare, devastating condition that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain stem and often leads to irreversible blindness and paralysis. Patients with NMOSD are diagnosed by multiple physician specialties including ophthalmologists or neurologists once they suffer their first attack. 
 Highly specific serum autoantibodies, AQP4-IgG, are thought to be present in about 80% of patients and are likely pathogenic. AQP4 autoantibodies induce central nervous system damage through complement activation and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. Since 2006, the presence of AQP4-IgG has been included as part of the NMOSD diagnostic criteria. However, it is noteworthy, that a patient can still be deemed a NMOSD patient even if no AQP4-IgG is present as long as other NMOSD definition criteria are met. 
 We have identified first-line newly diagnosed patients with NMOSD and patients with NMOSD that are unstable as our initial target population for inebilizumab, if approved by the FDA and assuming these patient populations are within the approved patient population. Patients with NMOSD are considered unstable if they are on an unapproved therapy and are at risk of suffering another attack based on physician assessment of severity and frequency of recent attacks. The majority of our initial target population are treated by NMOSD specialists, multiple sclerosis specialists and community neurologists. We estimate that NMOSD affects approximately 10,000 patients in the United States with approximately 70% of patients treated in a small number of medical centers of excellence. We plan to initially commercialize inebilizumab in the United States with a specialty clinical sales force of fewer than 30 individuals focused on the highest prescribers, which we believe is fewer than 300 physicians. 
 Our pre-launch commercial activities are focused on delivering comprehensive disease awareness and education to NMOSD specialists, multiple sclerosis specialists and community neurologists. These disease education efforts will communicate the importance of CD19-expressing B cells and plasma cells in producing autoantibodies, which leads to NMOSD. We believe the broad understanding of this evidence will help to establish inebilizumab as a first-line treatment in patients with NMOSD and support our launch uptake following FDA approval, if achieved. Over time we intend to address the stable NMOSD patient population who have not suffered a recent attack and are treated with an unapproved therapy, given the disease modification potential of inebilizumab. We believe the improved EDSS score, reduction in MRI lesions and reduction in hospitalization will be meaningful to patients. Furthermore, we believe the potential semi-annual maintenance dosing after the two initial doses on days 1 and 15 can improve patient quality of life. 
 We have conducted market research with physicians and payors to forecast the potential commercial opportunity for inebilizumab in the United States. We have also completed preliminary health economic analyses of the potential direct cost savings that inebilizumab may be able to provide to the healthcare system and have completed multiple surveys with payors to evaluate the potential coverage for inebilizumab by health insurers. Health insurers surveyed have indicated that their perception of the likelihood of inebilizumab coverage is influenced by the lack of FDA-approved first-line monotherapy treatments and the potential for inebilizumab to provide significant direct cost savings based on its potential to prevent the next attack for patients with NMOSD. Based on these analyses, we believe that the pricing for inebilizumab can be supported above the current pricing for other unapproved therapies for treating NMOSD. We estimate that approximately 50% to 65% of our target patient population is commercially-insured and may be eligible for co-pay assistance programs to help them access inebilizumab. 
 30

To address markets outside of the United States, we plan to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can sell inebilizumab in target markets. We anticipate that in certain markets additional clinical trials of inebilizumab may be required to obtain regulatory approval and/or ensure market access. We have formed a collaboration partnership with Hansoh Pharma for co-development and commercialization of inebilizumab in patients with NMOSD and other autoimmune diseases and hematological cancers in China, Hong Kong and Macau and we are continuing to evaluate potential partnerships to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of inebilizumab in NMOSD in other geographic regions. See “—Licenses and Strategic Agreements—Hansoh License and Collaboration Agreement”. In addition, we have formed a collaboration partnership with MTPC for co-development and commercialization of inebilizumab in Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan for NMOSD as well as other indications that we and MTPC mutually agree to add to the MTPC License Agreement. See “—Licenses and Strategic Agreements—MTPC Agreement”.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, dosing, cost, effectiveness of promotional support and intellectual property protection. With respect specifically to inebilizumab for patients with NMOSD, we expect the key competitive factors affecting the success of inebilizumab, if approved, will include the intended patient population (AQP4+ and AQP4- patients), the ability to use as a first-line therapy and as a monotherapy, the low frequency of dosing and administration and efficacy. 
 Inebilizumab for NMOSD 
 If inebilizumab is approved for the treatment of NMOSD, it will likely compete with two products that have achieved successful pivotal studies in NMOSD: Eculizumab from Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alexion, to be marketed as Soliris®, and satralizumab from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Chugai: 
  
• | In September 2018, Alexion reported positive pivotal data for Soliris® as an add-on therapy in patients with severe AQP4+ NMOSD. The trial, which was conducted in 143 patients, met its primary endpoint of time to first adjudicated on-trial relapse, demonstrating that treatment with Soliris® reduced the risk of NMOSD relapse by 94.2% compared to placebo (p < 0.0001). At 48 weeks, 97.9% of patients receiving Soliris® were free of relapse compared to 63.2% of patients receiving placebo. In addition, treatment with Soliris® reduced the adjudicated on-trial annualized relapse rate compared to placebo, a key secondary endpoint, by 95.5% (p<0.0001). With respect to its other secondary endpoints, including disability and quality of life measures, while the trial results favored Soliris®, the observed differences were small. Soliris® requires dosing every seven days for the first five weeks followed by dosing every 14 days thereafter. In June 2019, Alexion received FDA approval of Soliris® for the treatment of adults with NMOSD. Soliris has a boxed warning to alert health care professionals and patients that life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with Soliris, and that such infections may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early.

• | In October 2018, Chugai reported positive pivotal data for satralizumab as an add-on therapy in patients with AQP4+ and AQP4- NMOSD. The trial was conducted outside of the United States and met its primary endpoint of time to first protocol-defined relapse in the double-blind period, demonstrating that treatment with satralizumab reduced the risk of NMOSD relapse by 62% compared to placebo (p = 0.0184; n = 83). The proportion of relapse free patients at weeks 48 and 96 was 88.9% and 77.6% with satralizumab and 66.0% and 58.7% with placebo, respectively. In patients with AQP4+ NMOSD only, satralizumab showed a 79% reduction of NMOSD relapse compared to placebo (hazard ratio = 0.21; n = 55). In AQP4+ patients only, the proportion of relapse free patients at weeks 48 and 96 was 91.5% and 91.5% with satralizumab and 59.9% and 53.3% with placebo, respectively. In patients with AQP4- NMOSD only, satralizumab showed a 34% reduction of NMOSD relapse compared to placebo, and the proportion of relapse free patients at weeks 48 and 96 was 84.4% and 56.3% with satralizumab, and 75.5% and 67.1% with placebo, respectively. In the trial, satralizumab was dosed subcutaneously at baseline and then at weeks two and four, followed by monthly subcutaneous dosing for 20 months. In December 2018, Chugai reported that satralizumab has met its primary endpoint as a monotherapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, inebilizumab will likely compete with rituxumab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody marketed by Genentech USA, Inc., as Rituxan®. Rituximab is an approved therapy for the treatment of adults with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and Granulomatosis and Microscopic Polyangiitis. While 
 31

not approved for the treatment of NMOSD, treatment of patients with NMOSD with rituximab has been found by clinicians to reduce the frequency of relapses of NMOSD. 
 VIB4920 and VIB7734 
 If VIB4920 is approved, it may compete with Belatacept (NULOJIX®), a selective T cell co-stimulation blocker indicated for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving a kidney transplant that has been developed by Bristol-Myers Squib, as well as potential mAb drug candidates in development by UCB, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, AbbVie and Novartis. If VIB7734 is approved, it may compete with drug candidates in development by Biogen and Boehringer Ingelheim. 
 All of our product candidates, if approved, may also compete with current treatments used for autoimmune disease, including various immunosuppressants and steroids. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. Future collaborations and mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors. 
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. These competitors may also vie for a similar pool of qualified scientific and management talent, sites and patient populations for clinical trials, as well as for technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Supply and Manufacturing 
 We do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical development and, if any product candidate is approved, commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates in compliance with cGMP requirements for use in clinical trials under the guidance of members of our organization. In the case of inebilizumab, we rely on AstraZeneca and we currently have no alternative manufacturer in place. Under our commercial supply agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca has agreed to provide us with a commercial supply of drug product for inebilizumab. We believe that our existing stock of drug substance that has already been manufactured will be sufficient to supply us for approximately the first two years of the commercialization of inebilizumab in the United States. See “—Licenses and Strategic Agreements—Clinical Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited” and “—Licenses and Strategic Agreements—Commercial Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited”. 
 We have built an internal team with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, including cGMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. We plan to continue to invest in process science, product characterization and supply chain improvements over time. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we or our licensors have or are pursuing patents covering the composition of matter for each of our product candidates and we generally pursue patent protection covering methods-of-use for each clinical program. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide a period of clinical data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our drug products. 
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to adapt to competition or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop. 
 32

Our owned and in-licensed patent estate as of December 31, 2019, on a worldwide basis, includes over 300 granted or pending patent applications world-wide, spread over more than a dozen patent families, with 10 granted U.S. patents. The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of the first non-provisional patent application in a patent family, which may also serve as a priority application. However, the term of a U.S. patent, and certain ex-U.S. patents may be lengthened to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a drug (a Patent Term Extension (PTE) in the U.S. award of a Supplementary Patent Certificate (SPC) ex-U.S.). In the U.S. by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the USPTO may also result in lengthened patent term (referred to as Patent Term Adjustment (PTA)). For example, the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent covering an approved drug, its method of use or its methods of manufacture may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe and certain other countries including Japan. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court in the United States or a foreign country.  
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to obtain and maintain a proprietary position on our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims on these pending patents and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize drugs with similar mechanisms of action and duplicate our methods of treatments or strategies without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our clinical candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in pharmaceuticals is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our clinical candidates. 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in enforcing the claims that have been granted or may grant. However, any of our patents, including patents that we may rely on to protect our market for approved drugs, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court. Alternatively, we may decide that it is in our interest to settle a litigation in a manner that affects the term or enforceability of our patent. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that have been or may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents.

Inebilizumab Patent Coverage 
 Inebilizumab is covered by Viela-owned and in-licensed pending and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S. Exclusive of any Patent Term Extension, our current, owned or exclusively licensed, issued patents and pending non-provisional applications covering inebilizumab will expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2030, where issued, valid and enforceable. U.S. Patent 8,323,653, covering inebilizumab compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions, has been granted a Patent Term Adjustment from the Patent Office. As a result, if valid and enforceable, it is expected to expire in 2030, exclusive of any patent term extension.
 We have exclusively licensed from Duke University three international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and all corresponding family members thereof. One U.S. patent relevant to our activities has issued from the licensed Duke University applications; this U.S. patent generically covers inebilizumab and related compounds. The year of expiration for these patent families, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2026, without regard to any extensions or adjustments of term that may be available under national law.  
 VIB4920 Patent Coverage 
 VIB4920 is covered by Viela-owned and in-licensed pending and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions, including in the US. Exclusive of any Patent Term Extension, our current, owned or exclusively licensed, issued patents and pending non-provisional applications covering VIB4920 will expire on dates ranging from 2028 to 2039, where issued, valid and enforceable. U.S. Patent 10,000,553, covering VIB4920 compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions, has been granted a Patent Term Adjustment from the Patent Office. As a result, if valid and enforceable, it is expected to expire in 2034, exclusive of any patent term extension. 
 Further, we have licensed from MedImmune, LLC two international patent applications, and all corresponding family members thereof that cover (i) recombinant polypeptide scaffolds and (ii) methods of purifying an albumin-fusion protein. VIB4920 is comprised of a specific recombinant polypeptide scaffold fused to an albumin protein. The expected year of expiration for the first patent family, covering recombinant polypeptide scaffolds, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2028, without regard to any extensions or adjustments of term that may be available under national law. The expected year of expiration for the second patent family, covering methods of purifying an albumin-fusion protein, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2036, without regard to any extensions or restorations of term that may be available under national law. 
 VIB7734 Patent Coverage 
 VIB7734 is covered by Viela-owned and in-licensed pending and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions. Exclusive of any Patent Term Extension, our current, owned or exclusively licensed, issued patents and pending non-provisional applications covering VIB7734 will expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2037, where issued, valid and enforceable
 We have exclusively licensed from SBI Biotech Co. a patent family comprising issued patents and pending applications in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. The expected year of expiration for this patent family, where issued, valid and enforceable, is 2026, without regard to any extensions or adjustments of term that may be available under national law. This family relates to, for example, monoclonal antibodies, which bind to human ILT7, binds to none of human ILT1, ILT2 and human ILT3, and suppresses interferon-a (IFNa) production from ILT7-expressing cells, or a fragment comprising its antigen binding region.  
 Trade secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, 
 34

post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, including biologic products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 U.S. government regulation of biological products 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending biologic license applications, or BLAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | Completion of extensive pre-clinical studies and tests in accordance with applicable regulations, including Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical studies 
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing. The pre-clinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of pre-clinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing 
 35

information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term pre-clinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can refuse, suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional pre-clinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, 
 36

appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA review and approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy and may include both negative and ambiguous results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. This FDA review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA (for a standard review) and eight months from the date the BLA is submitted (for a priority review) because the FDA has approximately two months after BLA submission to make a “filing” decision. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
 Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or “REMS” plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric population for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the 
 37

FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the re-submitted BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication that could be used “off-label” by physicians in the orphan indication, even though the competitor’s product is not approved in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do of the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Expedited review and approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 In addition, under the provisions FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing 
 38

advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an irreversible effect on morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. 
 Once a BLA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if the FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Most products that are eligible for fast track or breakthrough therapy designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ satisfaction before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below. 
 39

Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. A recent federal district court ruling in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety based on constitutionality. This decision means numerous reforms enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, but not specifically related to health insurance, such as the BPCIA, would be invalid as well. While the presidential administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the 
 40

BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 U.S. patent term restoration 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension must be based on the first approval for the product, and the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond fourteen years from approval. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. 
 European Union drug development, review and approval 
 In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and it is anticipated to come into application in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures. 
 41

Centralized procedure 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the EMA, that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks. 
 National authorization procedures 
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
  
• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union regulatory exclusivity 
 In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time 
 42

the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
  
• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

 Rest of the world regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other U.S. healthcare laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other U.S., federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. For example, in the United States, sales, marketing, scientific and educational activities also must comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws (including, but not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback and false claims), drug pricing laws, transparency reporting laws, and data privacy laws. 
 The U.S. federal anti-kickback statute is a key federal fraud and abuse law. The U.S. federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Recently, pharmaceutical manufacturers’ patient support activities have been increasingly scrutinized as potentially providing prohibited remuneration to patients (and where such services ease providers’ administrative burdens, to providers as well) where such activities are not appropriately structured to comply with the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute (and other applicable healthcare fraud and abuse laws and government guidance). Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar 
 43

prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, or to self-pay patients. 
 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. As noted above, violations of the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute can give rise to False Claims Act violations. In addition, companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off-label), and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and regulations may affect our current or future ability to operate. Federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under federal healthcare programs. Some states also require reporting of certain drug prices or explanations for price increases. 
 The federal transparency requirements under the so-called federal “sunshine act” or Open Payments Act require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with transfers of value occurring in 2021, other healthcare practitioners, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Analogous state laws and regulations require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs including certain standards, to limit financial interactions with healthcare providers, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other health care providers. 
 In addition, products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 HIPAA and subsequent amendments establish certain requirements related to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information apply to many healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors with whom we interact, as do state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available exceptions and safe harbors, our business activities could potentially be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, we expect that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations. 
 Similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers 
 44

of value to healthcare professionals, may apply to us to the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a country other than the United States. 
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded drug and biologic products. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Providers and patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. As a result, if approved, sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. With respect to biologics, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligations imposed on patients. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of a product. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and is a time-consuming process. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. There is an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit. 
 Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our oral drug product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various federal healthcare programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if such payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
 Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
 Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Drugs that are not usually self-administered, such as infusion drugs, may be covered under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B drugs are generally reimbursed at the “average sales price” of the drug plus 6%. Oral or other self-administered drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Since 2011, manufacturers with marketed brand name drugs have been required to provide a discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by 
 45

Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits (initially 50% but increased to 70% in 2019). 
 Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS. FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service, or PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. 
 To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. 
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the European Union, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 Healthcare reform and potential changes to healthcare laws 
 The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDAs user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 46

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The current Presidential administration and members of the U.S. Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. A recent federal district court ruling struck down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. While the presidential administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act that affect healthcare expenditures. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products. 
 Other changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and that will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress. Individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control biotechnology and pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services.
