Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a leading provider of drug development services to the biopharmaceutical industry, focused on helping our customers bring their medicines and other treatments to patients around the world. We have been in the drug development services business for 35 years, providing a comprehensive suite of clinical development and laboratory services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and government organizations, as well as other industry participants. We have deep experience across a broad range of rapidly growing areas of the drug development industry and engage with our customers through a variety of commercial models, including both full-service and functional service partnerships and other offerings tailored to address the specific needs of our customers. We have two reportable segments, Clinical Development Services and Laboratory Services.
Our purpose and mission are to improve health by helping our customers deliver life-changing therapies to patients. We pursue our purpose and mission through our clinical development and laboratory services and our strategy to bend the cost and time curve of drug development and optimize value for our customers.
Our customers benefit from accelerated time to market because it results in lengthened periods of market exclusivity, and our real-world evidence solutions support the superior efficacy and value of their novel therapies. We believe our medical, scientific and drug development expertise, along with our innovative technologies and knowledge of global regulatory requirements, help our customers accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics and maximize returns on their research and development (“R&D”) investments.
Our service offerings include both clinical development and laboratory services. Our clinical development services include all phases of development (i.e., Phases I-IV), peri- and post-approval and site and patient access services. Our laboratory services offer a range of high-value, advanced testing services, including bioanalytical, biomarker, vaccine, good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) and central laboratory services. 
We have developed significant expertise in the design and execution of complex global clinical trials, a result of conducting studies on global, national, regional and local levels across a wide spectrum of therapeutic areas for 35 years and in over 100 countries. Our customers entrust us to design, execute and deliver results on some of the most critical aspects of the drug development process for the key assets in their pipelines. In 2019, we were involved in 87 drug approvals. As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 26,000 employees worldwide, approximately 5,200 of whom hold advanced degrees, and we had locations in 46 countries.
    Our deep understanding of the drug development process has allowed us to effectively invest in and evolve our service offerings to meet the needs of our customers. Examples of some of our recent initiatives and investments include:
•Innovative site and patient access. We have developed differentiated capabilities that meaningfully address two of the biggest challenges that our customers face: patient enrollment and site performance. Since 2013, we have deployed over $600 million making strategic acquisitions and bringing together complementary capabilities to create a delivery model which would be difficult to replicate. Through our Accelerated Enrollment Solutions (“AES”) delivery model, we focus on meeting the unique feasibility, site start-up and patient recruitment needs of each study. We address these complex needs by leveraging (i) large data sets, including identified and consented personal data and (ii) our global site network spanning five continents.We believe our AES delivery model (i) represents the industry’s largest aggregation of fully identified data on individuals who have provided their consent and indicated an interest in participating, or have participated, in clinical trials, and (ii) represents one of the world’s largest wholly-owned vaccine site networks. In 2020, AES developed and deployed an innovative technology platform to prescreen clinical trial patients online, in real time and worldwide, without having to visit a clinical research site in person, allowing the clinical trials that AES supports to continue largely uninterrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our AES delivery model allows us to support our customers in meeting their aggressive enrollment milestones and in improving diversity representation within trials. 
•Innovative peri-and post-approval studies. Our customers require evidence-based solutions to help them demonstrate the real-world effectiveness, safety and value of newly approved therapies, which are essential to optimize the commercial potential of their products. Since 2015, we have invested over $200 million to enhance our peri- and post-approval services and have significantly expanded our capabilities in this growing area, providing our customers with service offerings in areas such as (i) market access, (ii) health economics modeling and (iii) patient-centered research. During 2020, in connection with new COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic studies, we leveraged our scientific expertise and data to optimize and adapt study design and site selection to account for new and emerging COVID-19 pandemic hotspots. These capabilities continue to be important as our customers pursue post-approval safety studies, especially for vaccines, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
•Expanded digital clinical trial capabilities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we collaborated with two of our investees, Science 37, Inc. and Medable, Inc., to enable the application of digital technologies to the clinical trial process, to reduce patient burden, and to remove inefficiencies. In furtherance of these objectives, we expanded our suite of digital trial solutions by combining operational solutions such as direct-to-patient and direct-from-patient models incorporating home health care nursing, study drug administration, sample collection and the pickup and return of study materials, and by providing digital solutions such as eConsent, telemedicine, devices and wearables, and electronic clinical outcome assessments (“eCOA”), including electronic patient reported outcomes (“ePRO”). These capabilities have allowed us to offer trial continuity for customers through the pandemic, even as site access was disrupted, and in the year ended December 31, 2020, we supported more than three times as many digital and virtual studies than we did in the prior comparable period, before the pandemic. We believe we are a leader in helping our customers leverage these technologies for their clinical development programs.
•Advanced laboratory services. In response to strong customer demand for our services, we have invested over $200 million since 2015 to significantly increase the size and operating capacity of our laboratory facilities, acquire innovative laboratory equipment, expand our test menus and build out differentiated information technology (“IT”) systems and laboratory automation.
•Purpose-built PPD Biotech. Over the past five years, we pioneered the development of a new model to address the specific needs of the biotechnology sector. 
•Targeted geographic expansion. We maintain a strong presence of experienced professionals in all key regions and countries necessary to support our customers’ global drug development programs. In response to the growing importance of conducting global studies that include cohorts in Japan and China and the opportunity to serve local customers in those geographies with their global drug development needs, we have significantly increased the size and scale of our operations in those countries while maintaining the quality and operating standards demanded by our customers and regulatory authorities alike.
We believe these investments in our businesses and our innovative solutions have enhanced the strength of our clinical development and laboratory services and further differentiated our offerings from other clinical development organizations, increasing our total addressable market and providing us with meaningful competitive advantages and growth opportunities.
Our Industry
    The drug development process involves the testing of drug candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy in order to meet regulatory requirements. Developing new drugs for the treatment of human disease is an extremely expensive, complex, high-risk and time-consuming process. Bringing a new drug or medical device to market can take up to 15 years and cost $2.5 billion or more.
The drug development process consists of two stages: pre-clinical and clinical. In the pre-clinical stage, the new drug candidate is tested in vitro and in vivo in animals, generally over a one- to three-year period, to assess and optimize potential use in humans. After successful pre-clinical testing and receipt of required regulatory authorizations, the new drug candidate can be advanced to the clinical development stage, which involves testing in humans. We do not participate in the pre-clinical market. 
    The clinical stage is the most time-consuming and expensive part of the drug development process. In the context of the U.S. regulatory framework, during the clinical stage, the drug candidate undergoes a series of tests in humans, including healthy volunteers, as well as participants with the targeted disease or condition. Human trials usually start on a small scale to assess safety, efficacy and dosage (Phase I-II) and then expand to larger trials (Phase III) to test efficacy and safety in the target population. Phase IV, or post-approval clinical trials, involve monitoring or verifying the risks and benefits of a drug product. Real-world data and evidence studies, meaning data and evidence gathered outside of the context of clinical trials, are often used to assess usage, potential benefits or risks, safety, effectiveness and health economics to achieve successful market access and product uptake. The clinical drug development process and regulatory frameworks in other countries can vary from the United States framework, but in many ways are substantially similar.
Our Markets
    As of December 31, 2020, our total addressable market was estimated to be approximately $55.0 billion, consisting of (i) clinical development services and (ii) laboratory services. We believe the market for Phases I–III clinical development services and Phase IV / peri- and post-approval clinical development services to be approximately $33.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and anticipate that phases within this market will grow at average annual growth rates of approximately 6-9%. In addition, our AES delivery model allows us to participate in the economics and growth of the investigator and patient recruitment services market of clinical development services that otherwise would represent pass-through revenues, as it does for most other CROs. We believe this market to be approximately $11.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, and anticipate it will grow at an annual growth rate of approximately 6-7%. In addition to competing in the CRO market, through our strategic investments we have strengthened our position in the laboratory services market. We believe the laboratory services market, which includes both advanced testing services and central laboratory services, to be approximately $11.0 billion and anticipate it will grow at an annual growth rate of approximately 7-8%.
    We believe there are five key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for our offering of services:
•Growth in R&D spending. Biopharmaceutical companies must continually invest in drug development in order to create innovative new therapies or use existing drugs to treat new indications, to address unmet medical needs and to replace lost revenues when their currently marketed drugs lose patent protection. 
•Increased levels of outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies. As biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek ways to reduce clinical development costs and focus resources on core competencies, we believe they will continue to increase the amount of clinical development work they outsource to CROs. Drivers of increased outsourcing include:
◦biopharmaceutical companies’ desire for flexible cost structures and focus on core competencies;
◦experience, expertise, capability and value provided by CROs;
◦difficulty conducting large, global and complex clinical trials required by the current regulatory environment;
◦ability to generate real-world data and evidence; and
◦desire to address declining R&D productivity by utilizing more efficient means of conducting clinical trials.
•Increased complexity in clinical development. Clinical trials continue to increase in complexity due to a confluence of factors including, but not limited to, (i) new therapeutic modalities, (ii) the collection of more clinical trial endpoints, (iii) more specific patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (iv) ever-changing regulatory requirements and (v) an expansion of evidence generation methods, such as electronic patient-reported outcomes and virtual clinical trials. All of these factors result in more complex trial design, challenges in enrolling protocol-eligible patients, longer duration of clinical trials and greater overall clinical trial cost. As a result, we expect biopharmaceutical companies to increasingly seek partners that have the experience and expertise to conduct cost-effective clinical studies. In particular, we believe large CROs who possess scale, geographic reach and differentiated capabilities to manage the complexity of clinical trials will continue to grow at a higher rate and take market share versus the overall industry.
•Biotechnology sector growth. The U.S. biotechnology sector has grown rapidly over the last decade and has emerged as a key customer segment for the drug development services industry. The rate of biotechnology companies’ R&D spending growth has been higher than that of traditional pharmaceutical companies in recent years. This has largely been fueled by a robust funding environment, both public and private, with over $250 billion of capital raised for biotechnology companies in the last three years. Many biotechnology companies are smaller, discovery research-focused organizations that do not find it economically attractive to invest in the infrastructure and personnel necessary to conduct their clinical development programs on their own, and we believe they will continue to rely on CROs, like us, for their global drug development needs.
•Increasing importance to prove value of new therapies. As participants in the healthcare industry are increasingly focused on managing costs, biopharmaceutical companies need to find alternatives to align market constituents on the value of their treatments. The ability to perform peri- and post-approval studies to transform real-world data (such as medical claims data or electronic medical records) into real-world evidence provides biopharmaceutical companies a solution to quantify the value of new therapies to market constituents. Real-world data and evidence enable biopharmaceutical companies to develop better therapies and optimize the commercial potential of their new therapies. With increased R&D activity and competition among newly approved therapies in similar indications, we anticipate the continued adoption of real-world data and evidence to demonstrate the value of new medicines.
Our Competitive Strengths
The drug development services industry is highly competitive, consisting of hundreds of small, limited-scope service providers and a limited number of large full-service global development companies. While the industry has seen an increasing level of consolidation over the past several years, largely driven by the larger full-service providers, it remains highly fragmented. Our Clinical Development Services segment competes primarily with a small number of other global, full-service CROs, although we also compete against small and medium-sized niche CROs, in-house R&D departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. Our Laboratory Services segment competes primarily with the laboratory businesses of other large CROs, large global laboratory organizations, specialty laboratories and in-house laboratories of biopharmaceutical companies. 
We believe we are well-positioned to serve the global biopharmaceutical industry in obtaining the approval for, and maximizing the market access and value of, their new medicines. We differentiate ourselves from others in our industry through our competitive strengths, which include:

We intend to continue investing in our scientific and operational capabilities to further strengthen our leadership position in key therapeutic areas and position ourselves to take advantage of the evolving trends in the biopharmaceutical industry.
Build Upon Our Existing Dedicated Biotech Offering
    Biotechnology companies focused on new and complex therapies have accounted for a large portion of new drug approvals and have driven significant growth in related R&D spending over the last few years. Large biopharmaceutical companies have had to fill gaps in their pipelines through strategic collaborations with, and acquisitions of, biotechnology companies, further increasing growth in the number of innovative, complex and global clinical trials. We were at the forefront of realizing these trends and formed our dedicated PPD Biotech model in 2014. Since 2015, we have more than doubled PPD Biotech annual authorizations and grown revenue by over 80%. We continue to leverage our sophisticated customer development activities within PPD Biotech, which include early identification of novel molecules and extensive pre-trial consultative advisory engagement with customers, to optimally position ourselves to win new business. PPD Biotech’s success is evidenced by the increase in our win rates from biotechnology companies whereby we have increased our average win rate from approximately 26% in 2016 to over 40% in 2020. We believe that our track record of serving biotechnology companies through our PPD Biotech model has earned us a reputation as the strategic partner of choice. 
Increase Use of Our Innovative Site Network and Patient Enrollment Platform
Through our AES delivery model, we have developed an approach to directly serve our customers’ needs by addressing patient enrollment and site performance challenges, which are two of the biggest challenges our customers face in clinical development. We believe our integrated strategy of combining technology with our large aggregation of identified and consented data and our global site network is the ideal approach to serving our customers. To date, AES has played a critical role in completing some of the most important and complex clinical trials for our customers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, AES deployed an innovative technology platform to prescreen clinical trial patients remotely, in real time and worldwide, without having to visit a clinical research site in person, allowing AES sites to expand patient reach. We plan to continue to build out our AES capabilities and further strengthen the value propositions we offer and deliver to our customers through this differentiated model.
    In addition to providing us with a competitively advantaged asset, our AES delivery model is financially attractive as it allows us to participate in the economics and growth of the market for investigator and patient recruitment services that otherwise would represent pass-through revenues, as is the case for most other CROs.
Capitalize on our Growing Laboratory Segment
Our laboratory services offering is focused on the high-growth, innovative segment of laboratory services through its diverse range of high-value, advanced testing services. As an example, we have developed a significant and growing number of assays to address the testing needs of gene therapy, and several molecular, serology and functional assays that we believe will be critical to the success of COVID-19 vaccine trials. We also continue to expand our global laboratory services footprint. For example, we are in the process of opening a new laboratory in Suzhou, China, offering bioanalytical, biomarker and vaccine services, which we expect will be fully operational in 2021. Our Laboratory Services segment represents approximately 18.7% of our 2020 revenues and increased approximately 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. It also affords us significant operating leverage and diversification, and provides higher backlog visibility and related conversion rates. Our Laboratory Services segment allows us to provide integrated offerings to customers that need both clinical development and laboratory services.

We focus on providing long-term, large-scale studies where laboratory measurement of clinically relevant endpoints is critical. Our central laboratories utilize the same standard operating procedures and maintain identical instruments in every facility. All of our facilities are College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) accredited, and National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (“NGSP”) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) lipid standardization survey (“LSP”) certified. All our facilities run the same CAP proficiency tests on a quarterly basis. In addition to these industry quality standards, we run our own unique global laboratory assay standardization survey program monthly on our most common analyses, ensuring continuity and consistency of data at all stages of a clinical project. We also standardize data collection and reporting on a global basis utilizing the same software platform, our Preclarus central laboratory database. This platform provides real-time data and eliminates the need to merge data sets from different regions. Our laboratories provide on-site biorepository services that enable storage and archiving of samples for future testing, including specialized biomarker testing of specific patient populations to speed drug discovery and development efforts. In 2018, we formed a global strategic alliance for pathology and molecular testing solutions with NeoGenomics to provide a fully integrated global pathology and molecular testing solution to our customers, further expanding our central laboratory services related to oncology clinical trial activities.
Intellectual Property
    In the course of conducting our business, we have developed, and continue to develop and use proprietary software, systems, processes, databases and other intellectual property. We seek to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets through confidentiality agreements with employees, customers and other third parties, as well as administrative and technical safeguards. We rely on patent, copyright and trademark laws, as may be appropriate and applicable, to protect our other intellectual property rights. For example, we have applied for and/or obtained and maintain registration in the United States and other countries for numerous trademarks, including PPD®, PPD Biotech®, PPD Laboratories® and Preclarus®. We also enter into agreements with third-parties for the license and use of their intellectual property, although no one such license is considered to be material to the business as a whole. We do not have any material patents.
Government Regulation
Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
The development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution and post-approval monitoring and reporting of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), as well as those of other countries, such as the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) in the European Union, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) in the United Kingdom, the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) in China and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) in Japan. These regulations apply to our customers and are generally applicable to us when we are providing services to our customers, either as a result of their direct applicability, through a transfer of regulatory obligations from our customers, or as a consequence of acting as local legal representative on behalf of our customers in a particular country or countries. Consequently, we must comply with all relevant laws and regulations in the conduct of our Clinical Development Services and Laboratory Services segments. The following discussion describes the role of the FDA in the clinical drug development process in the United States. Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protections of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other materials. FDA laws and regulations may apply to clinical studies conducted outside the United States if, for example, such studies are conducted under an investigational new drug application (“IND”) or offered as support for an IND. However, some regions and countries do not allow for clinical trials to be conducted under foreign country legislation. Therefore, the FDA may waive certain requirements such as the institutional review board (“IRB”) requirements for a foreign institutional review board/independent ethics committee (“IRB/IEC”) that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) but may not meet may not meet all the IRB requirements contained in Title 21 Part 56 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations. 
Prior to commencing human clinical trials in the United States, a company developing a new drug must file an IND with the FDA. The IND must include information about pre-clinical tests, manufacturing and control data, and a study protocol for the proposed clinical trial of the drug in humans. If the FDA does not object in writing within 30 days after filing, the IND becomes effective and the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with an effective IND. Similarly, the development of new medical devices in the United States requires an investigational device exemption application (“IDE”), unless exempt, prior to conducting human clinical trials. For therapeutic and diagnostic products that combine drugs, devices, and/or biological products, these are considered combination products. The FDA will make a determination based on the prior mode of action as to which FDA center will take the lead on the review. Nonetheless, due to the nature of combination products, there can still be differences in regulatory pathways for each component. These differences can impact regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including pre-clinical tests, clinical studies, manufacturing and control data as well as adverse event reporting.
The study protocol must also be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC for each principal investigator’s site in which a study is proposed to be conducted and each IRB/IEC may impose additional requirements on the conduct of the study in its institution. IRB/IECs have the authority to review, approve and monitor clinical trials, and clinical trials are subject to oversight by IRB/IECs. The industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials is embodied in the FDA’s regulations for IRB/IECs, investigators and sponsor/monitors, which regulations collectively are termed GCP by industry, and the GCP guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”), which have been agreed upon by industry and regulatory representatives from the United States, the European Union and Japan. GCP requirements address, among other things, IRBs, qualified investigators, informed consent, recordkeeping and reporting. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP requirements through periodic inspections, and violations of GCP requirements could result in enforcement actions including the issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, product recalls, criminal prosecutions or debarment from involvement in the submission of New Drug Applications/Biologics License Applications (“NDAs” and “BLAs,” respectively). Our global standard operating procedures are written in accordance with all applicable FDA, EMA, MHRA, NMPA, PMDA, ICH and GCP requirements. This enables our work to be conducted locally, regionally and globally to standards that meet all currently applicable regulatory requirements. We must also maintain records and documentation in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for each study for auditing by the customer and regulatory authorities.
In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, sponsors of clinical trials must, among other things:
•comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified investigators;
•obtain specific written commitments from the investigators;
•obtain IRB/IEC review and approval of the clinical trial;
•verify that appropriate patient informed consent is obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
•ensure adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
•monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
•maintain records regarding drug or biologic dispensing and disposition;
•instruct investigators and study staff to maintain records and reports; and
•permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
If a clinical trial is not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the applicable regulatory agency may require that a clinical trial be modified, suspended or terminated, and we or our customers may be subject to a variety of sanctions. For example, violations could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning or untitled letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. IRBs may also suspend or terminate research not conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be liable for significant costs or penalties and our reputation could be harmed,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
After receiving IRB/IEC approval, clinical trials usually start on a small scale to assess safety and then expand to larger trials to test both efficacy and safety in the target population. The trials are generally conducted in three phases (Phases I, II and III), which may overlap or be combined, although the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily conduct, a fourth phase of clinical trials (Phase IV) as a condition of approval or to obtain additional data on the product under investigation, respectively. After the successful completion of the first three clinical phases, a company requests approval for marketing its product by submitting an NDA for a drug or a BLA for a biologic product. NDAs/BLAs are comprehensive filings that include, among other things, the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about how the product will be manufactured, additional stability data and proposed labeling. The FDA’s review may last from several months to several years. Once the NDA/BLA is approved, the product may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA as part of its approval. The FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”). REMS may be required by the FDA for a product where serious safety concerns exist in order to help ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. All marketed products require post-marketing safety surveillance. 
Regulation of Testing Facilities
Laboratories such as ours that provide information included in INDs, NDAs, BLAs and other regulatory submissions must conform to regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process and data. For example, our bioanalytical laboratories follow the GLP requirements adopted by the FDA, the Ministry of Health in the United Kingdom and by similar regulatory authorities in other countries, as applicable. Our product analysis laboratories follow the GMP requirements adopted by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Both GLPs and GMPs require standardized procedures for all equipment, processes and analytical tests, for recording and reporting data, and for retaining appropriate records. To help ensure compliance with GLPs and GMPs, we have established standard operating procedures, working practice documents and processes, and have quality assurance personnel at our laboratory facilities to audit test data and inspect testing procedures, laboratory equipment and facilities.
In addition, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of study subjects must comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (the “CLIA”). The CLIA requires laboratories to meet staffing, proficiency and quality standards, and governs laboratory accreditation, inspection and certification. Our testing facility in Austin, Texas and our central laboratory in Highland Heights, Kentucky are CLIA-certified. A failure to comply with CLIA requirements may expose laboratories to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Non-compliant laboratories may also have their CLIA certificate suspended, limited, or revoked. These laboratories are also subject to applicable U.S. state laboratory requirements and to accreditation bodies governing their testing and reporting functions, including the CAP, CDC LSP and NGSP. Our central laboratories in Highland Heights, Kentucky, Brussels, Belgium, Singapore and Shanghai, China are all accredited by CAP. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be liable for significant costs or penalties and our reputation could be harmed,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Regulation of Personal Information
We hold confidential personal health and other information relating to persons who have been, are and may in the future be involved in clinical trials or otherwise. The possession, retention, use and disclosure of such information is highly regulated, both in the United States and the other jurisdictions we are subject to, including but not limited to, applicable regulations arising from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and the Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, 45 C.F.R. Parts 160-164, that implement those laws; U.S. state privacy, security and breach notification and healthcare information laws; and the E.U. General Data Protection Directive (the “GDPR”) and the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018. 
We do not consider our service offerings to generally cause us to be subject to HIPAA as a directly covered entity; however, there are some limited circumstances where we enter into business associate agreements. 
We endeavor to embrace sound information protection practices and have implemented data protection agreements with our customers, affiliates and vendors which establish safeguards regarding the creation, receipt, maintenance and transmission of protected personal information. We maintain a global privacy policy and employ dedicated privacy professionals who work closely with our senior executive leadership as part of our efforts to address applicable privacy laws. 
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to numerous privacy and data security laws and our failure to comply with those laws could cause us significant harm,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Other Regulations
    We are also subject to numerous additional national laws, rules and regulations, including those enforced by the following U.S. agencies:
•Occupational Safety and Health Administration;
•Nuclear Regulatory Commission;
•Environmental Protection Agency;
•Department of Transportation;
•International Civil Aviation Organization;
•Department of Health and Human Services; and
•U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”).
    Our laboratories registered with the DEA may receive and manage controlled substances for research purposes. The DEA regulates controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act and other laws and the regulations that implement such laws. The DEA requirements include obligations related to recordkeeping, security, handling, diversion and disposal of controlled substances. If we fail to comply with the DEA requirements regarding controlled substances, our registration may be suspended or revoked or renewal of our registration may be denied, and we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, injunctions or other enforcement actions. Our laboratories listed below are registered with the DEA:
•clinical pharmacology units in Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada;
•bioanalytical laboratories in Middleton, Wisconsin and Richmond, Virginia; and
•GMP laboratory in Middleton, Wisconsin.
    Our laboratory in Athlone, Ireland is registered with the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority and may receive and manage controlled substances.
We also must comply with other related international, federal, state and local regulations that govern the use, handling, disposal, packaging, shipment and receipt of certain drugs or unknown compounds, chemicals and chemical waste, toxic substances, biohazards and biohazard waste, and radioactive materials and radioactive waste. In order to comply with these regulations, we have established standard operating procedures, and provide appropriate equipment and training to our employees involved in these activities. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business uses biological and hazardous materials, which are regulated by various laws. As such, we are exposed to liabilities for violations of those laws and claims for personal injury or death that could materially adversely affect our business,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research, the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, fines and other sanctions, as well as liability to our customers. Furthermore, any issuance of a notice of finding by a governmental authority against either us or our customers, based upon a material violation by us of any applicable regulation, could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.
Healthcare Reform
    In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the pharmaceutical industry, which, in turn, could affect our business. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was signed into law. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular importance to the pharmaceutical industry, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research and establishes a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA’s individual mandate is unconstitutional because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act modified the individual mandate so that it could no longer constitute a tax and remanded the case to a U.S. district court in Texas to determine if the remainder of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. Pending a final decision, which is expected by mid-2021, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what the effect of this decision will have on the ACA and our business. Litigation over the ACA is likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, suspended the 2% Medicare sequestration payment reduction from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, but extended sequestration through 2030. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, and proposed and enacted legislation and regulations designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference-pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. Any of these judicial, legislative or regulatory developments could harm our customers’ businesses, which could cause them to reduce their spending on research and development, which, in turn, could negatively impact our business.
Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “Bribery Act”). The FCPA and the Bribery Act prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and third parties acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a “foreign official” for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA further requires us to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The Bribery Act also prohibits “commercial” bribery and accepting bribes.
Our global business operations also must be conducted in compliance with applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s (the “U.S. Treasury”) Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty’s Treasury and other relevant sanctions authorities.
Violations of these anti-corruption laws or export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations, or even allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For example, violations may result in criminal or civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, related stockholder lawsuits and other remedial measures, and companies that violate these laws can be debarred by the U.S. government and lose U.S. export privileges. Future changes in anti-corruption, export control or economic sanctions laws, regulations or enforcement could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
Human Capital Management
Our key human capital management objectives are to recruit, develop and retain the highest quality talent in order to be the employer of choice in the CRO industry. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to attract and develop talent to enable employees to succeed in their roles and afford them opportunities for development, reward employees through competitive pay and benefit programs and enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive.
We strive to develop talent through our commitment to, and investment in, learning and development. Our holistic approach to training incorporates a multitude of training and development programs, including job-specific modules and programs related to personal career growth, leadership and manager development, including online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats. In addition, we offer training to our entry-level professionals through our Clinical Research Assistant Academy, an internal, seven-week training program that incorporates a variety of learning formats to provide attendees a solid knowledge in monitoring and a network of resources. In 2020, this employee-training course was awarded the Brandon Hall Gold Award by the Brandon Hall Group Human Capital Management Excellence in Learning Awards. 
In order to recruit, develop and retain the highest quality talent, we are committed to providing market-competitive pay and benefits. Our suite of benefits include, among others, comprehensive health insurance coverage for employees, parental leave to new parents for birth and adoption of a child, and mental and behavioral health resources, including on-demand access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents. In addition, in order to foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders, long-term equity-based incentives are provided to eligible employees, and all part-time and full-time employees are eligible for our annual performance-based cash incentive program which rewards individuals for achievement of company and personal goals. We also pursue pay equity, including equal pay for equal outcomes, as well as for gender, racial and other diverse populations (including all protected classes).
Finally, we are committed to enhancing our culture by making the workplace more engaging and inclusive. We recognize that our diversity makes our business stronger and strive to be an inclusive organization where colleagues can be their authentic selves and grow their careers. Our business resource groups, such as WEN (Women’s Empowerment Network), PRIDE Business Resource Group, and BOLD (Black Organization for Leadership Development) help us attract and retain a diverse workforce by fostering inclusion, encouraging open dialogue and creating an opportunity for personal and professional development. 
Our investment in these areas has been recognized by industry publications. In 2020, for the ninth consecutive year, we received honors from Training magazine for our employee training and development programs while Forbes magazine named us to their list of America’s Best Employers in the large company category in 2018 and 2019. We have also received regional awards for these efforts, such as Forbes magazine naming us to their list of America’s Best-in-State Employers for North Carolina in 2020, and Great Place to Work naming us as one of the Best Workplaces in Greater China. 
Our consistent focus on talent and culture has contributed to both overall retention and retention in key operational roles, such as project managers, that is significantly ahead of industry averages. Our low turnover rates in key operational roles, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, provide our customers consistency in their study teams and is an important differentiator for us. For example, our project manager turnover rates have ranged from 7.6% in 2018 to 6.2% in 2020, and have consistently trended below industry averages. 
We believe that our attraction and retention of employees with technical and therapeutic expertise also provides us with a competitive advantage—of our more than 26,000 employees as of December 31, 2020, approximately 5,200 hold advanced, masters or equivalent degrees, including over 1,000 MDs and PhDs. As a result, we have industry-shaping domain expertise and thought leadership, including in key areas such as product development strategy, protocol design, outcomes and patient-centered research and health economics. 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed more than 26,000 employees. Approximately 54% of our employees are located outside of the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia. Voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was at an industry-leading level of 9.7% as of December 2020. At the end of fiscal year 2020, our global workforce was 29% male and 71% female, and women represented 39% of our leadership (defined as vice president level and above). In the U.S., ethnicity of our workforce was 68% White, 12% Asian, 11% Black, 6% Hispanic and 2% other.
Backlog and Authorizations
We manage and assess our business in part based on the performance of our consolidated business using a number of metrics including backlog and net authorizations. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—How We Assess the Performance of Our Business,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Net Authorizations and Backlog,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Indemnification and Insurance
    Our business exposes us to potential liability including, but not limited to, potential liability for (i) breach of contract or negligence claims by our customers, (ii) non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations and (iii) third-party claims in connection with our performance of drug development services (for example, patient claims for personal injury). In certain circumstances, we may also be liable for the acts or omissions of others, such as suppliers of goods or services.
    We attempt to manage our potential liability to third-parties through contractual protection (such as indemnification and limitation of liability provisions) in our contracts with customers and others, and through insurance. The contractual indemnification provisions vary in scope and generally do not protect us against all potential liabilities, such as liability arising out of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, in the event that we seek to enforce such an indemnification provision, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient resources to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or may otherwise not comply with its contractual obligations.
    We generally require our customers and other counterparties to maintain adequate insurance, and we currently maintain errors, omissions and professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe to be appropriate. This insurance generally provides coverage for vicarious liability due to the negligence of the investigators who contract with us, as well as claims by our customers that a clinical trial was compromised due to an error or omission from us. The coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims made and such claims may be contested by applicable insurance carriers.
