ITEM 1. BUSINESS



In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” “our” and “Alpine” refer to Alpine Acquisition Corp.



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 8, 2021 for the purpose of effecting entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to our initial public offering and searching for a target business.



Our efforts to identify a prospective target business is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. As described further below, we currently intend to combine with Two Bit Circus, a Los Angeles-based experiential entertainment company that is affiliated with certain members of our management team, concurrent with the completion of our initial business combination. We will not, however, complete an initial business combination with only Two Bit Circus. While we may pursue an initial business combination with a company in any sector, and in any stage of its corporate evolution we are focusing our search on drive-to destination hotels, digital entertainment and gaming, and lodging technology businesses, which complements the expertise of our management team, directors and advisors.



Alpine Consolidated



Our sponsor, Alpine Acquisition Sponsor LLC, is an entity affiliated with Alpine Consolidated. Alpine Consolidated is a private venture investing firm founded in 1996 by Elan Blutinger and D. Fraser Bullock with a focus on identifying and creating new entities in emerging segments in leisure travel where technology can accelerate growth and develop new business models. Alpine Consolidated would then capitalize these businesses through public equity markets. It has created business leaders in fragmented industries by backing and working with disciplined and practical innovators with strong operating histories that have developed new leisure travel and technology businesses. Since 1996, team members and advisors of Alpine Consolidated have experience as founders, investors and/or management (including board members) in a number of public and private companies, including Travel Services International (NASDAQ: TRVL), Resortquest International (NYSE: RZT), Hotels.Com (NASDAQ: ROOM), Online travel Company (LSE AIM: LSE). Great Wolf Resorts (NASDAQ: WOLF), Orbitz (NASDAQ: ORBZ), YouBet (NASDAQ: UBET), and Angie’s List (NASDAQ: ANGI). Alpine Consolidated’s privately-held ventures include VacationLink (acquired by Kinderhook Industries), AudioNow (acquired by Zeno Media), Espresoh Tech [acquired by Alpine Consolidated), SIM Partners (acquired by Reputation.com), Signal Digital (a Transunion company) and ParkWhiz (now Arrive Mobility, Inc.).



Alpine Consolidated was founded on the idea that identifying and building new business models in leisure travel and hospitality, given the accelerating impact of technology on travel, succeeds by bringing together a talented group of individuals that make up the various parts of the changing leisure travel industry. Today, Alpine Consolidated’s management and advisors are highly experienced, former and current business operators, and investors, with proven track records and deep experience in the following fields:




● | Technology-based family entertainment
--+--------------------------------------


● | Lodging finance, development, and technology
--+---------------------------------------------


● | Entertainment businesses focused on millennial families
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer branding and standardization
--+--------------------------------------


● | User-experience and mobile product design and development
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Cross-platform technology integration
--+--------------------------------------


● | Real estate based family entertainment and marketing
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Large-scale commercial real estate development
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Capital markets
--+----------------


● | Risk management
--+----------------


● | Intellectual property
--+----------------------

The result is a team that we believe is unique in the entertainment, travel and hospitality industry in both composition, experience and breadth of skills.



Alpine Consolidated typically operates as a venture investor by first identifying opportunities and then bringing to bear its collective skills, knowledge and judgment to evaluate them. Once an opportunity is selected, Alpine Consolidated makes it available to its advisors who can contribute capital and engage with the target’s management to provide hands-on support and access to Alpine Consolidated’s networks. Alpine Consolidated’s team members and advisors typically become highly engaged with the target opportunity as needed. Some or all of Alpine Consolidated’s management and advisors will likely become investors in ventures it elects to back.



We intend to utilize the Alpine Consolidated platform to help affect a business combination including the firm’s resources in sourcing, research, analytics, diligence, underwriting, structuring and execution. We believe that Alpine Consolidated’s reputation, experience, access, and network are well-suited to take advantage of the current and future opportunities present in the lodging, entertainment, and technology industries. Alpine Consolidated has a powerful network in our target industries.



Business Strategy and Target Industries



Our objective is to create, through a business combination, a new scalable family entertainment brand that is focused on millennials, currently the largest segment of travelers. We believe the last regional brand that was focused on families, which is an underserved, profitable and loyal market, was Great Wolf Lodge, which was launched 25 years ago. We intend to try to develop a similar type of family brand through the consummation of our initial business combination, targeting existing business conference hotels with ample space to support the integration of family-based digital entertainment, which our management team understands and has significant experience working with. We then intend to further enhance stockholder value by identifying and completing additional acquisitions, implementing operational improvements and expanding the targets’ product offerings and geographic footprints into the top 100 markets in North America.



We expect to utilize our management team’s unique experience to simultaneously identify opportunities while staying current with technological advances and consumer preferences. We expect our selection process will leverage our management team’s contacts in the digital entertainment and adjacent lodging sectors, which we believe will provide us with access to attractive business combination opportunities in these sectors.



As a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) focused on drive-to destination hotels, digital entertainment and gaming, and lodging technology businesses, we believe that we are in a unique position to capitalize on the expected recovery and pent-up demand in the top drive to North American markets for safe domestic family-based entertainment.



We believe the use of interactive gaming technology in drive-to destination hotels will drive loyalty, higher rates, and occupancy, and overall strong financial results. There is an underserved market for high-quality family entertainment in the hospitality industry. Through our business combination, we will seek to provide a new family play brand that allows families to drive to their destinations and incorporate social experiences inside guest rooms as well as large entertainment zones. Millennials are now the largest purchaser of consumer services and as “digital natives” expect their experiences to give them a progressively personalized service utilizing the best in entertainment that they are accustomed to.



Hotels were materially and adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Conference Center hotels with a focus on corporate and group travel were even more adversely affected and will have a longer recovery. Our management team believes there currently is a greater opportunity to acquire these hotels and create increased occupancy and rates by offering unique digital entertainment available only to its guests.

Our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company that compliments the unique experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational, development and marketing and brand expertise in experience-based regional hotels. Our business combination strategy will be to leverage our management team’s network of relationships, knowledge and experience in these sectors to locate and consummate an initial business combination. We believe that given the operational and investment experience of our management team in the sectors we are focusing on, we are well positioned to identify a target business that can create strong value for its customers



Competitive Strengths



We believe that we possess several competitive strengths to successfully source, evaluate and execute an initial business combination. We believe that the background, operating history and experience of our management team provides us not only with access to a broad spectrum of investment opportunities, but also with the ability to significantly improve upon the operational and financial performance of a target business.



Experienced management



Although we may pursue a target business in any stage of its corporate evolution or in any industry, sector or geographic region, we are focusing our search on drive-to hotels and digital platforms for immersive and experiential entertainment. We currently intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business in these two markets and/or adjacent industries, as well as on the reputation, significant deal-making experience and relationships of our management team to complete an initial business combination. The business executives that comprise our management team are recognized leaders in the family entertainment and hospitality industry. They were involved in the creation, development, operation and evolution of Great Wolf Lodge which became a widely recognized US brand in drive-to family entertainment hotels. In addition, our management team, through long-standing industry relationships, has global access to the operating, venture capital and financial sponsor communities, providing a key portal into a pipeline of potential target acquisition opportunities.



Our management team consists of seasoned industry executives, with proven track records of:




● | operating fast growing, location-based digital and technology-based entertainment businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creating, developing, and operating family entertainment hotels on a national level;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | merging hotel and immersive entertainment into award-winning family favorite destination resorts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing hotel companies, both organically and through acquisitions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | building local location-based portfolio infrastructure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | developing businesses focused on millennial family entertainment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | evaluating key experiential entertainment trends and building innovative hotels with content platforms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | building cohesive and productive management and operating teams across national markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sourcing, structuring, financing, acquiring and selling businesses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fostering relationships with sellers, investors and target management teams; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifying, evaluating, and scaling consumer-facing technology development opportunities and engineering teams
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that a target business will benefit from the experience and involvement of our team in the lodging, technology and family entertainment industries to create improved returns in the business we invest in.

Initial Business Combination



We will have until 12 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $0.10 per public share per three-month extension on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the time period described above, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us (net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest that may be used for liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the warrants will be worthless.



Concurrently with our initial business combination, we currently intend to combine with Two Bit Circus. We believe the combination of Two Bit Circus and another target business in the entertainment space, under the Two Bit Circus umbrella, will allow the resulting combined company to leverage Two Bit Circus’ existing licenses, experienced management team and geographic footprint and offer significant synergy and long-term value creation opportunities for our investors and serve as a platform for further growth.



We will not, however, complete an initial business combination with only Two Bit Circus. In addition, we will likely not consummate a merger with Two Bit Circus if the target business with respect to our initial business combination is not within the entertainment space. If we pursue a combination with Two Bit Circus concurrently with our initial business combination, a committee of our disinterested directors will negotiate the terms and conditions of such merger (including the valuation of Two Bit Circus) on our behalf. Such committee of disinterested directors would also obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the proposed merger with Two Bit Circus is fair to our company and our stockholders from a financial point of view. Our public stockholders will have the same voting and redemption rights with respect to any business combination including with Two Bit Circus as are applicable to a business combination which does not include Two Bit Circus, all as described elsewhere in this prospectus.



Nasdaq rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq after this offering, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination. If we combine with Two Bit Circus concurrently with our initial business combination, we will not include the fair market value of Two Bit Circus for purposes of satisfying the 80% fair market value test.





7






We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target.



However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. Similar to our approach with respect to a potential merger with Two Bit Circus, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company (or stockholders) from a financial point of view.



Members of our management team directly or indirectly own shares of common stock and warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Additionally, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity, including other blank check companies similar to our company, pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.



Sources of Target Businesses



We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus for our Initial Public Offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, and our other stockholders may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. We may also determine to engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on a formal basis, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial stockholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Lack of Business Diversification



Our business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In the case of a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
Redemption Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, for their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.



Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly.



We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Any proxy solicitation materials that we furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his redemption rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise redemption rights.



There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares prior to a specified date. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.



Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivers his certificate in connection with an election of their redemption and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).





11






If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only until the date that is 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time we have to consummate an initial business combination as described below) complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete a business combination by such date and our stockholders do not otherwise approve an extension of time to consummate an initial business combination, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes payable on such funds, less up to $100,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable (subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors). At such time, the warrants will expire, holder of warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such warrants and the warrants will be worthless.



Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our deadline and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.





12






Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.



We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, the underwriters, who have not waived their rights to indemnification provided by us under the underwriting agreement, or other third parties whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, the agreement entered into by our Sponsor specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, we cannot assure you that the per-share distribution from the trust account, if we liquidate the Trust Account because we have not completed a business combination within the required time period, will not be less than $10.20.



In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf to enforce these indemnification obligations, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per share.



If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.





13






Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period or in connection with certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights and followed the procedures described above and as detailed in the applicable proxy or tender offer materials.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the underwriters in our Initial Public Offering deferred underwriting commissions of an aggregate fee of $3,745,000 upon consummation of our initial business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------




In recent years, and especially since the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Employees



We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect each of our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.





14






Facilities



Our executive offices are located at 10141 N. Canyon View Lane, Fountain Hills, Arizona 85268, and our telephone number is (703) 899-1028.  The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay an affiliate of our Sponsor for general and administrative services. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
