Industry Background
 
Non-alcoholic beverages are among the most widely distributed food products in the world and are being sold through more than 400,000 retailers in the United States, our core market. The United States has more than 2,600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. The beverage market is controlled by two giants, The Coca-Cola Company (“Coke”) and PepsiCo, combining for over 70% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. Carbonated beverage sales are slipping, while non-carbonated beverage sales are growing. The demand for “better-for you” and functional drinks are two of the fastest growing beverage categories. Experts predict that beverage companies that only offer carbonated beverages will have to work hard to off-set flagging demand. Industry watchers believe that growth will be largely confined to non-carbonated beverages and will chiefly affect functional drinks.
 
Bottled water maintains a steady growth pace, ranking at the top of beverage sales by volume in the United States. Total bottled water sales reached $18.1B from 2019-2020 seeing a 5.7% year over year growth. The global bottled water market size is expected to reach USD 505.19 billion by 2028, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2021 to 2028. The growing awareness regarding the adverse health effects of consuming sugary drinks, such as weight gain, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, is supporting the consumption of alternative beverages, such as still and sparkling water.
 
The growth of the market is primarily attributed to rising awareness regarding the importance of hydration. According to a study conducted by the International Bottled Water Association in 2018, it was revealed that 93% of American citizens want bottled water to be sold in most stores selling beverages. A substantial part of the population prefers to quench their thirst using bottled water over other beverages.
 
Increasing preference for nutrient-fortified water is trending owing to the rising importance of health and wellness among buyers. Bottled water demand has been increasing among travelers, working professionals, and for use in households.
 
Since the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, there has been a significant boost in CBD store fronts, both brick and mortar, and online retailers across the country. In 2019, total sales of hemp-derived CBD consumer products in the U.S. were approximately $1.2 billion. In the last year, consumers likely have become more dependent on hemp-CBD products due to the events of 2020. We believe these and other factors are the reason some experts have projected CBD-related sales in 2020 to be nearly $2 billion and grow to $6.9 billion by 2025.

Distribution Systems
 
Our distribution strategy is comprised of traditional beverage distribution through established channels.
 
Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) – DSD players, and regional and local distributors touch over 90% of retail chains in the US. DSDs primarily distribute beverages, chips, snacks and milk and provide pre-sales, delivery and merchandising services to their customers. Service levels are daily and weekly, and they require 25% to 30% gross profit from sales to their customers. We will grant these independent distributors the exclusive right in defined territories to distribute finished cases of one or more of our products through written agreements. These agreements typically include compensation to those distributors in the event we provide product directly to one of our regional retailers located in the distributor’s region. We will choose our distributors based on their perceived ability to build our brand franchise in convenience stores and grocery stores.
 
Direct to Retail Channel (“Warehouse Direct”) – We are targeting listings with large retail convenience store and grocery store chains where we ship direct to the chain stores warehousing system. Retailers must have warehousing and delivery capabilities. Services to retailers will be provided by an assigned broker, approved by us, to oversee pre-sale and merchandising services. Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains, retail accounts, including mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs, we will negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products, and the account is serviced through the retailer’s appointed distribution system. These arrangements are terminable at any time by these retailers or us and will contain no minimum purchase commitments.
 
Direct to Consumer – Our brands are available for direct retail purchase on Amazon and Goodhemplivin.com. Additionally, specialty stores can set up wholesale account at goodhemplivin.com.
 
Production Facilities
 
Our strategy is to outsource the manufacturing and warehousing of our products to independent contract manufacturers (“co-packers”). We purchase our raw materials from North American suppliers which deliver to our third-party co-packers. We use two or more co-packers to manufacture and package our products. Once our products are manufactured, we store finished product in a warehouse adjacent to each co-packer or in third party warehouses. Our co-packers have been chosen based on their proximity to markets covered by our distributors. Most of the ingredients used in the formulation of our products are off-the shelf and thus readily available. Under normal circumstances, no ingredient has a lead time greater than three-to-six weeks. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers, we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time, in which case we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We regularly review our contract packing needs considering regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs.

Raw Materials
 
Substantially all the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. The raw materials used in the preparation and packaging of our products consists primarily of juice concentrates, natural flavors, stevia, pure cane sugar, bottles, labels, trays and enclosures. These raw materials are purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials, which are available from multiple suppliers.
 
We purchase our flavor concentrate from several flavor concentrate suppliers. Generally, all natural flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. The development of new products and flavors, independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. We anticipate that for future flavors and additional products, we may purchase flavor concentrate from other flavor houses with the intention of developing other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products. If we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
New Product Development
 
Our product philosophy will continue to be based on developing products in those segments of the market that offer the greatest chance of success such as health, wellness and natural refreshment and rehydration, and we will continue to seek out underserved market niches. We believe we can quickly respond, given our technical and marketing expertise, to changing market conditions with new and innovative products. We are committed to developing products that are distinct, meet a quantifiable need, are proprietary, lend themselves to a markup on production costs of least a 60%, project a quality and healthy image, and can be distributed through existing distribution channels. We are identifying brands of other companies with a view to acquiring them or taking on the exclusive distribution of their products.
Intellectual Property
 
We own the following intellectual property: Good Hemp® trademark, Good Hemp 2oh!, Good Hemp fizz!, Canna Hemp and Canna beverage formulations.
 
Seasonality
 
Our sales are expected to be seasonal and experience fluctuations in quarterly results because of many factors. Historically, the industry experiences an increase in revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. Thus, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the entire fiscal year.
