Item 1. Business 

Overview
Splunk provides innovative software solutions that ingest data from different sources including systems, devices and interactions, and turn that data into meaningful business insights across the organization. Our Data-to-Everything platform enables users to investigate, monitor, analyze and act on data regardless of format or source. Data is produced by nearly every software application and electronic device across an organization and contains a real-time record of various activities, such as business transactions, customer and user behavior, and security threats. Beyond an organization's traditional information technology (“IT”) and security infrastructure, data from the Industrial Internet, including industrial control systems, sensors, supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) systems, networks, manufacturing systems, smart meters and the Internet of Things (“IoT”), which includes consumer-oriented systems, such as electronic wearables, mobile devices, automobiles and medical devices are also continuously generating data. Our Data-to-Everything platform helps organizations gain the value contained in data by delivering real-time information to enable operational decision making.
Our mission is to make data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone in an organization. Our customers leverage our offerings for various use cases, including infrastructure and operations management, security and compliance, software development and IT operations, applications management and business analytics, and to provide insights into data generated by IoT and industrial data, among many others. Our offerings are intended to help users in various roles, including IT, security, application development, manufacturing and business professionals, quickly analyze their data and achieve real-time visibility into and intelligence about their organization’s operations. We believe this enables organizations to improve service levels, reduce operational costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate and maintain compliance, drive better business decisions, and increase efficiency through data-driven automation. This results in greater efficiency, security and competitive advantage for our customers.
Our Product Offerings 
Splunk Enterprise    Our flagship product is Splunk Enterprise, a real-time data platform, comprised of collection, indexing, search, reporting, analysis, alerting, monitoring and data management capabilities. Splunk Enterprise can collect and index petabytes of data daily, irrespective of format or source. Our data platform uses our patented data processing architecture that performs dynamic schema creation at read time, rather than write time, enabling users to run queries on data without having to define or understand the structure of the data prior to collection and indexing. This is in contrast to traditional IT systems that require users to establish the format of their data prior to collection in order to answer a pre-set list of questions. Splunk Enterprise also enables customers to interactively explore, analyze and visualize data stored in data sources such as Hadoop and Amazon S3. Our technology delivers speed, scalability and advanced analytics including machine learning when processing massive amounts of data for anomaly detection, event grouping, prediction and other methods. Our software leverages improvements in the cost and performance of commodity computing and can be deployed in a wide variety of computing environments, from a single laptop to large globally distributed data centers, as well as public, private and hybrid cloud environments.
Splunk Cloud    Splunk Cloud delivers the benefits of Splunk Enterprise deployed and managed reliably and scalably as a service. Splunk Cloud is available globally and eliminates the need to purchase, deploy and manage infrastructure. Splunk Cloud can be used to collect, analyze and store data in a public cloud environment or via a hybrid approach that spans cloud and on-premises environments. A single Splunk interface can search data stored in both on-premises Splunk Enterprise instances, as well as Splunk Cloud instances, providing a single point of visibility and analysis across the customer’s entire enterprise.

Users that prefer to deploy the software on-premises can take advantage of our free 60-day trial of Splunk Enterprise and a 15-day free trial is available to users that prefer the core functionalities of Splunk Enterprise delivered as a cloud service. These users can sign up for Splunk Cloud and avoid the need to provision, deploy and manage internal infrastructure. Alternatively, they can simply download and install the software, typically in a matter of hours, to connect to their relevant data sources. Customers can also provision a compute instance on AWS via a pre-built Amazon Machine Image, which delivers a pre-configured virtual machine instance with our Splunk Enterprise software. We offer free development-test licenses for certain commercial customers, allowing users to explore new data and use cases in a non-production environment without incurring additional fees. We also offer support, training and professional services to our customers to assist in the deployment of our software.
Our Growth Strategy 
Our goal is to make Splunk the standard platform for delivering real-time business insights from data. The key elements of our strategy are to:
Extend our technological capabilities.    We intend to continue to invest heavily in product development to deliver additional features and performance enhancements, deployment models and solutions that can address new markets and support Splunk software usage across multiple use cases. In particular, we intend to invest in our suite of cloud services to both deliver new capabilities as well as provide a cloud-first experience to our customers including more frequent, automated software updates and making the in-product experience self-service for administrators and users. To support the growth of our Cloud customer base, we will continue to invest in supporting massive ingest and search scale as a service. We will continue to expand into adjacent products, services and technologies that enable organizations to further realize the value of their data across cloud and on-premises environments. Our investments may involve hiring and internal development, acquisitions and licensing of third-party technology.
Continue to expand our direct and indirect sales organization, including our partner relationships, to increase our sales capacity and enable greater market presence.    We will continue to increase investments in our sales and marketing organizations to enable the acquisition of new customers, as well as expansion within our current customer base. Our investments will be spread across geographies, customer tiers and industries. We will continue to invest in and foster the growth of our partner relationships, both inside and outside the United States, to enable greater leverage in our go-to-market investments. We will also expand go-to-market channels that enable new ways to consume our offerings.
Further penetrate our existing customer base and drive enterprise-wide adoption.    We will continue to drive customer satisfaction and renewals by offering community, standard, enterprise and global support to ensure our customers’ success with our offerings. We will continue to cultivate incremental sales from our existing customers through increased use of our offerings within organizations, as well as consultative services that broaden the customer’s awareness of our product and service capabilities. In particular, we will continue to seek to upsell increased indexing capacity to our existing customers for additional deployments and new use cases. Our recent acquisitions of SignalFx, Omnition, and VictorOps provide us with access to customers and markets that are highly sophisticated in their use of cloud-native technologies and DevOps methodologies. We will continue to develop a SaaS model that allows for high velocity sales, especially to customers where traditional enterprise sales models are not as effective. We believe our existing customer base serves as a strong source of incremental revenues given the horizontal applicability of our offerings and the growing data volumes and use cases our customers experience. Our sales teams are responsible for securing new customers, obtaining renewals of existing contracts and increasing adoption of our software by existing customers.
Enhance our value proposition through a focus on solutions which address core and expanded use cases.    We will continue to organize our go-to-market and product strategy around our customer use cases. We have invested in market groups for Security and IT buying centers and, with the acquisition of SignalFx and Omnition in 2019, we have expanded our IT offerings with enhanced capabilities for application development teams. This approach includes offering capabilities, either in the form of platform features or premium solutions, which target both our core use cases and new use cases, as driven by our corporate strategy and customer demand. We believe premium solutions in particular will enable us to increase our market 
penetration, expand our addressable market opportunity and make our products a more targeted solution for specific challenges that our customers face across their organizations.
Grow our user communities and partner ecosystem to increase awareness of our brand, target new use cases, drive operational leverage and deliver more targeted, higher value solutions.    We believe our user community has the potential to provide significant operating leverage by delivering apps that extend the Splunk platform into new use cases. We will continue to invest in business development initiatives in order to add additional technology alliances, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and strategic relationships to enable new sales channels for our offerings as well as extend our product integrations with third-party products. In addition, once these relationships have been established, we expect that OEM vendors and managed service providers will continue to invest in and create customized application functionality based on our platform.
Continue to deliver a rich developer environment to enable rapid development of enterprise applications that leverage data and the Splunk platform.    We intend to continue our investments in SDKs and APIs that help software developers leverage the Splunk platform. Our SDKs enable developers to build solutions that deeply integrate the analytics functionality of our offerings across the enterprise. Through our investments in SDKs and APIs, we intend to promote and extend the capabilities of our offerings to customers who wish to build sophisticated applications and interfaces that leverage our software and services.
Pricing
Splunk provides flexible pricing options for customers of all sizes:
Data Ingestion Pricing.    Pricing is based on the amount of data indexed, namely the maximum aggregate volume of uncompressed data indexed on a daily basis, expressed in gigabytes, terabytes or petabytes per day. Once a data ingestion license is purchased, there is no limit or additional costs based on other product usage elements nor the customer’s preferred deployment size or model. For Splunk Cloud customers, ingestion pricing is generally based on an annual subscription fee that takes into consideration the combination of the volume of data indexed per day and the amount of data stored. 
Predictive Pricing.    We recently introduced the Predictive Pricing Program (“PPP”), a simple, tiered pricing model for private sector organizations that provides more predictability and flexibility as these organizations scale. PPP offers pricing to customers based on predefined volume tiers. Customers can consume data up to the maximum in each tier for a single price and get clear visibility in the cost of the subsequent higher tiers. PPP is available for Splunk Enterprise, Splunk ES, Splunk UBA and Splunk ITSI.
Infrastructure Pricing.    Infrastructure pricing is available for customers who want an alternative pricing metric to data ingestion. Pricing is determined by the amount of compute resources Splunk products have access to rather than data volume ingested. Infrastructure pricing is available for Splunk Enterprise, Splunk ES, Splunk ITSI, as well as equivalent offerings in Splunk Cloud, and allows customers to control the amount of product consumption while making explicit choices between search response times and amount of data indexed. 
Rapid Adoption Packages.    Splunk offers a number of Rapid Adoption Packages for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud customers which are designed for specific IT and security use cases. These packages may scale up in data volume depending on the use case and additional use cases are purchased separately. 
Some of our offerings address markets where other pricing models may be prevalent. For example, the pricing of Splunk Phantom and VictorOps is based on the number of seats that use the products.

We host “.conf” and multiple partner conferences as other ways to support the Splunk community to foster collaboration and help our customers drive further business results from our software.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our offerings, develop new end market specific solutions and apps, conduct software and quality assurance testing and improve our core technology. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing offerings.
Intellectual Property
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, internal policies and contractual provisions to protect our technology and intellectual property rights. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, its type and the jurisdiction in which it arises. We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products.
We retain ownership of software we develop. All software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code or as a cloud service pursuant to browser-wrap, embedded or on-line license or service terms, or signed customer agreements. These agreements generally contain restrictions on duplication, disclosure, transfer and license circumvention. We are currently unable to measure the full extent of unauthorized use of our software. We believe, however, that such unauthorized use is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results.
Customers
We have over 19,400 customers in more than 130 countries, including over 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, as of January 31, 2020. We exclude users of our trial software and users of VictorOps and SignalFx from our customer count. We provide offerings to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, educational institutions and government agencies. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues for any of the periods presented. Our current customer base spans numerous industry verticals, including cloud and online services; education; financial services; government; healthcare/pharmaceuticals; industrials/manufacturing; media/entertainment; retail/ecommerce; technology and telecommunications.
Backlog and Seasonality
Our backlog represents non-cancelable orders that have not been recognized as revenue and have not yet been invoiced. We had backlog of approximately $794.9 million and $379.8 million as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
For information regarding the seasonality in the sale of our offerings, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Trends” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
We compete against a variety of large cloud service providers and software vendors, as well as smaller specialized companies, open source projects and custom development efforts, which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include:

• | large cloud service providers, as well as small, specialized vendors, that provide complementary or competitive solutions in enterprise data analytics, security offerings, log aggregation and management, data warehousing, orchestration, automation, incident response and big data technologies that may compete with our offerings;


• | IT departments of potential customers which have undertaken custom software development efforts to analyze and manage their data;


• | companies targeting the big data market by commercializing open source software, such as Elastic;


• | security, systems management and other IT vendors, including BMC Software, IBM, Intel, Micro Focus, Microsoft and VMware;


• | business intelligence vendors, analytics and visualization vendors, including IBM and Oracle;


• | cloud monitoring and APM vendors, including Cisco AppDynamics, Datadog and New Relic; and


• | public cloud providers, including Amazon (Amazon Web Service), Google (Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft (Microsoft Azure).

The principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, performance and support, product scalability and flexibility, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership and time to value. We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors. For example, Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and our premium solutions all contain rich feature sets that reduce costly deployment cycles typically associated with enterprise software.
Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, broader global distribution and presence, competitive pricing and more developed ecosystems of partners and skilled users. In addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on delivering real-time business insights from data and could directly compete with us. Companies may develop open source-based alternatives that, customers may conclude, offer equivalent or superior functionality to our Splunk offerings. Smaller companies could also launch new offerings that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly.
Employees
As of January 31, 2020, we had over 5,800 employees. None of our United States employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. Employees in certain European countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
