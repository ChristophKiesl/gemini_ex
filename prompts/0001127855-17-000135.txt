We are an exploration stage mineral company.  During the year ended November 30, 2015 we were an Inactive Registrant as that term is defined in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  As such, we were not required to present within our Form 10-K audited financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2015.  We did not qualify for the Inactive Registrant exemption for the year ended November 30, 2016 due to our issuance of a controlling block of common stock to our Secretary, Mark Rodenbeck, in June 2016.  Accordingly, we have included unaudited financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2015 comparatively with our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2016.
 
On May 3, 2013, our consulting geologist acquired a 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in the MC00000266 mining claim (hereafter the "Claim") which was held in trust for us.  The Claim was located in the Northeast Athabasca Basin, in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada.  It was located on provincial lands administered by the Province of Saskatchewan.  The legal and ownership rights on the claim were limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable regulations.  The Claim totaled roughly 2,014 acres or 3.15 square miles in size and was located approximately 25 miles north of the community of Points North, Saskatchewan.
 
We were unable to raise the necessary funding to keep the mineral Claim in good standing and in May 2015, we forfeited our legal and beneficial ownership interest in the Claim for non-payment. As of November 30, 2015, we no longer held a beneficial interest in the Claim or any other mineral properties.
 
We plan to proceed with the acquisition and exploration of mineral claims to determine whether there are commercially exploitable reserves of gold, silver, or uranium.
 
Competition
 
The mineral exploration industry, in general, is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered, a ready market may not exist for the sale of the reserves.
 
Most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater resources to engage in the production of mineral claims. Our operations are not yet well-established and our resources at the present time are limited. We may exhaust all of our resources and be unable to complete full exploration of any Mineral Claim. There is also significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral exploration activities. If a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and we are unable to retain additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations. These factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable deposit is found to exist.
 
Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees as of the date of this filing, other than Dale Rasmussen who serves as our President, CEO, and CFO, and Mark Rodenbeck who serves as our Secretary.  Our Officers receive no compensation for their services to us.
