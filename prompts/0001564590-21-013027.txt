ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and delivering treatments that restore and preserve vision for people with serious back of the eye diseases. Our proprietary SCS Microinjector targeting the suprachoroidal space, or SCS, offers unique access to the macula, retina and choroid where sight-threatening disease often occurs. Our SCS injection platform is an inherently flexible, in-office, non-surgical procedure intended to provide targeted delivery to the site of disease and to work with both established and new formulations of medications, as well as future therapeutic innovations.
 We are leveraging our SCS injection platform by building an internal research and development pipeline targeting retinal diseases and by creating external collaborations with other companies. Using our suprachoroidal injection technology in conjunction with proprietary formulations of existing drugs as well as novel therapies, we believe that we have created a broad therapeutic platform for developing product candidates to treat serious eye diseases. 
 Our Suprachoroidal Injection Technology Platform
 Our suprachoroidal injection platform is a novel, patented approach for delivering pharmacotherapy to the back of the eye via the SCS. When fluid is injected between the choroid and sclera, the elasticity of the SCS allows the fluid to migrate and spread spherically toward the posterior regions of the eye where it is absorbed into adjacent tissue. Our proprietary microinjector is able to precisely administer drugs into the SCS utilizing a needle that is approximately one millimeter in length. This non-surgical method of administration facilitates more targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to chorioretinal structures and can be accomplished in an in-office setting. The suprachoroidal injection procedure is depicted in the picture below.

With suprachoroidal injections, product candidates are more directly administered to the retina and choroid, limiting exposure to non-target tissues as compared to other ocular drug administration techniques. Intravitreal injections, the current standard for delivery of many drugs for eye diseases, rely on diffusion of drug outward from the vitreous, a jelly-like substance that occupies the central portion of the eye, to the retina and choroid. This diffusion can result in lower concentrations of drug in these targeted areas and the drug spreading to unintended parts of the eye, potentially causing significant side effects. We believe treatment of eye disease via suprachoroidal injection of our product candidates may provide a number of benefits, including a non-surgical procedure, lower frequency of administration, limited exposure to non-targeted tissues, faster onset of therapeutic effect and an improved safety profile.
 Our extensive patent portfolio provides us with exclusive rights to develop and commercialize pharmacological agents for treatment of eye diseases via suprachoroidal injection. We believe this proprietary method of administration has the potential to become the standard for the delivery of therapies intended to treat retinal and choroidal diseases. Our drug candidates, SCS Microinjector and method of drug administration into the SCS are protected by 22 issued U.S. patents and more than 50 European and international patents broadly directed to the use of the device, administration of any drug into the SCS by injection, as well as specific product candidates.

Our SCS Microinjector
 Our proprietary SCS Microinjector, shown in the picture below, can be used to inject a wide variety of drugs into the SCS. Our internally developed and our collaborators’ drug candidates are specifically formulated to be injected via suprachoroidal injection with our SCS Microinjector in order to flow to the back of the eye. The SCS Microinjector is composed of a syringe and two 30-gauge hollow microneedles of varying lengths, each less than 1.2 millimeters, within a custom-designed hub that optimizes insertion and suprachoroidal administration of drugs.
 
Current intravitreal injections are performed in a procedure similar to that of suprachoroidal injections, except that the hypodermic needles and syringes used in intravitreal injection procedures are designed so that the needle penetrates through all of the layers of the eye and drug is injected into the vitreous cavity. Intravitreal injections are typically performed using a needle that is approximately five millimeters in length, or five times the length of our microneedle. Using a needle of this length, the physician penetrates past the sclera, choroid and retina until reaching the vitreous and does not receive any tactile feedback as to when the needle reaches one of the layers between the sclera and the vitreous. 
 By contrast, our SCS Microinjector is designed to inject drug into the suprachoroidal space. This suprachoroidal injection is designed to be carried out perpendicular to the sclera, at a site similar to an intravitreal injection, under local anesthesia. Once the microneedle penetrates the sclera and reaches the SCS, the boundary between the sclera and the choroid, the open bevel of the needle releases the drug between these two layers. Once drug is injected into the SCS, it spreads within the SCS to the back of the eye, precisely targeting the cells of interest. Our SCS Microinjector has been used in over 1,200 suprachoroidal injections as part of our clinical trials.
 Our Pipeline
 We have research capabilities focused on developing proprietary therapeutic formulations to utilize with our SCS Microinjector. Our internal research and development initiatives are focused on small molecules and gene therapy to address unmet 
 5

needs in back-of-the-eye diseases. In addition to growing our internal pipeline, we are also focused on collaborating with other companies to provide access to the suprachoroidal space through the use of our SCS Microinjector. 
 The current development status of our pipeline of internal product candidates and external collaborations is summarized in the chart below:


Internal Development Pipeline
 We are developing a proprietary suspension of axitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, for suprachoroidal injection, which we refer to as CLS-AX. 
In our preclinical studies, administration of CLS-AX through suprachoroidal injection was well tolerated and showed durability over several months, providing us with the opportunity to potentially reduce treatment burden and address a primary need for wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, patients.  
 In August 2020, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, had accepted our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for CLS-AX. 
 In January 2021, we announced that the first patients had been enrolled in our Phase 1/2a clinical trial of CLS-AX, known as OASIS. In March 2021, we completed patient dosing in the first cohort of OASIS and we expect to report initial safety data from this cohort in mid-2021.
 We have initiated another small molecule program utilizing suprachoroidal administration of an integrin inhibitor suspension. Integrins play a role in pathologic processes, such as inflammation, angiogenesis and fibrosis. Integrin inhibition has had some recent preliminary validation in preclinical models and clinical studies of diabetic macular edema and macular degeneration conducted by others. We believe that integrin inhibition could potentially serve as primary therapy, adjunctive therapy to anti-VEGF agents or secondary therapy in refractory cases of diabetic macular edema and macular degeneration. Suprachoroidal delivery of an integrin inhibitor suspension could provide targeting, compartmentalization and durability advantages over topical or intravitreal delivery, similar to what we have observed in other preclinical studies of small molecule suspensions, such as triamcinolone acetonide and axitinib. Therefore, we are assessing ocular tolerability, distribution and pharmacokinetics of our integrin inhibitor suprachoroidal suspension in a series of preclinical studies. We expect to conclude these studies this year.
 Based on our preclinical studies, we believe that gene therapy is a promising approach to treating retinal diseases, particularly those that are inherited, and that our suprachoroidal injection technology can enhance the benefits of this approach. Multiple, peer-reviewed publications have also validated a suprachoroidal gene therapy treatment approach.  Our work in this area includes suprachoroidal administration of therapeutic transgenes and non-viral vector gene therapy. Our preclinical proof-of-concept studies utilizing suprachoroidal delivery of marker genes using DNA nanoparticles have shown the potential for suprachoroidal administration to deliver genes. We plan to present this data at a medical conference in the second quarter of 2021.

External Collaborations Pipeline
 During the second half of 2019, we entered into three license and other agreements that we believe validate and expand the reach of our suprachoroidal injection platform. In October 2019, we announced that Bausch + Lomb, a division of Bausch Health Companies, Inc., or Bausch, acquired an exclusive license for the commercialization and development of XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide suprachoroidal injectable suspension) in the United States and Canada. In April 2020, we granted Bausch an exclusive option to develop, manufacture, distribute, promote, market and commercialize XIPERE in one or more of the following regions: (i) the European Union, including the United Kingdom, (ii) Australia and New Zealand and (iii) South America and Mexico.
 In October 2019, REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENXBIO, exercised its option to license our SCS Microinjector technology for in-office delivery of adeno-associated virus, or AAV,-based therapeutics to the SCS to potentially treat AMD, diabetic retinopathy and other conditions for which chronic anti-VEGF treatment is currently the standard of care. REGENXBIO has initiated their Phase 2 clinical trial, entitled AAVIATE, for the treatment of wet AMD and in January 2021 announced the completion of enrollment in Cohort 1. They also expect to report data from their Phase 2 clinical trial, entitled ALTITUDE, for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, in 2021. 
 In July 2019, Aura Biosciences, or Aura, licensed our SCS Microinjector to deliver Aura’s proprietary drug candidates into the SCS for the potential treatment of certain ocular cancers, including choroidal melanoma. Aura has initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of choroidal melanoma.
 In March 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the Arctic Vision License Agreement, with Arctic Vision (Hong Kong) Limited, or Arctic Vision. Pursuant to the Arctic Vision License Agreement, we granted an exclusive license to Arctic Vision to develop, distribute, promote, market and commercialize XIPERE, subject to specified exceptions, in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea, or the Arctic Territory. In December 2020, Arctic Vision announced approval of its IND for a Phase 3 clinical trial of XIPERE in China.
 By entering into these partnerships, we are able to expand the use of our suprachoroidal injection platform to other indications and geographies globally. Under these license agreements, we received $11.1 million of non-dilutive capital in the form of upfront payments during 2019 and 2020, and we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of more than $200 million in potential future development and sales milestones, as well as and royalties from net sales of covered products. 
 XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide suprachoroidal injectable suspension) 
 Our first candidate, XIPERE, formerly known as CLS-TA, is a proprietary, preservative-free suspension of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, formulated for administration via suprachoroidal injection. Corticosteroids are the standard of care in uveitis. They are effective at treating the inflammatory aspect of ocular disease, but when delivered locally, either topically as drops, intravitreally, or by periocular injection, they have been associated with significant side effects, such as cataract formation or exacerbation, and elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, which can lead to glaucoma. 
 XIPERE is being developed for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. Uveitis is a set of ocular inflammatory conditions affecting approximately 350,000 patients in the United States and more than one million worldwide. Approximately one-third of uveitis patients develop uveitic macular edema, a build-up of fluid in the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Macular edema is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in uveitis patients and can occur from uveitis affecting any anatomic location—anterior, intermediate, posterior or panuveitis. The uveitis market is expected to grow to nearly $550 million by 2024 in the United States, and over $1 billion globally.
 
XIPERE regulatory approval pathway
 In December 2018, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for XIPERE for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. In February 2019, we announced that we had received notification that the FDA had accepted the NDA and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date for completion of its review by October 2019.  
 In October 2019, we received a complete response letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for XIPERE. The FDA did not identify any efficacy issues, and there were no requests for further clinical efficacy studies. As anticipated, the CRL included the FDA’s request for additional stability data, additional clarifying information on components of the manufacturing process, and reinspection of the drug product manufacturer. The CRL included one new request for additional data on clinical use of the final to-be-marketed SCS Microinjector delivery system. In response to that request, we proposed the submission of SCS Microinjector clinical use information in 160 subjects from our TOPAZ study, as described below, for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion, or RVO. In subsequent correspondence, the FDA agreed that it would be acceptable for us to submit such data in lieu of the requested clinical use evaluation.
 7

In August 2020, we secured a new contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to manufacture the registration batches of XIPERE for the resubmission of our NDA, as well as to manufacture batches of XIPERE for potential commercialization. Our prior CMO notified us that they were no longer willing to serve as our commercial supplier for XIPERE and that they were uncertain about being prepared for an FDA pre-approval inspection on our timeline. We transferred the technology underlying the manufacturing process to the new CMO. We expect to resubmit the XIPERE NDA in the second quarter of 2021. We anticipate that the FDA will review the NDA within six months of the resubmission date.
 
We are also evaluating options for potential submissions to regulatory agencies in additional territories outside of the United States and Canada for XIPERE for the treatment of patients with macular edema associated with uveitis. 
 
License agreement for commercialization of XIPERE in United States and Canada
 In October 2019, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Bausch for the commercialization and development of XIPERE in the United States and Canada, or the License Agreement. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Bausch paid us an upfront payment of $5.0 million, which is subject to a refund if the License Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances. In addition, Bausch has agreed to make additional payments of up to $15.0 million upon the achievement of specified pre-launch development and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $56.0 million in additional milestone payments upon the achievement of regulatory approvals for specified additional indications of XIPERE and certain levels of annual net sales. Further, during the applicable royalty term, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties at increasing percentages, from the high-teens to twenty percent, based on XIPERE achieving certain annual net sales thresholds in the United States and Canada, as well as a lower royalty on annual net sales of other products, in each case subject to reductions in specified circumstances, although we will not receive any royalties on the first $30.0 million of cumulative net sales of all products.
 We are responsible for all development expenses for XIPERE until our NDA for XIPERE is approved by the FDA, subject to specified exceptions, as well as manufacturing costs in connection with the NDA. We are also responsible for all clinical and development expenses conducted to satisfy the FDA’s requests in the CRL and any subsequent CRL related to the NDA, or the CRL-related expenses. If XIPERE is approved by the FDA, Bausch will be responsible for all expenses following such approval, although we will be responsible for one-half of the costs of any post-approval clinical trials required by the FDA, up to a specified maximum amount.
 In April 2020, we amended the License Agreement to grant Bausch an exclusive option, or the Option, to develop, manufacture, distribute, promote, market and commercialize XIPERE in one or more of the following regions: (i) the European Union, including the United Kingdom, (ii) Australia and New Zealand and (iii) South America and Mexico, or collectively the Additional Regions, in exchange for Bausch extending the deadline by which we must obtain regulatory approval for XIPERE in the United States. The Option may be exercised as to any or all of the Additional Regions any time before the earlier of regulatory approval of XIPERE in the United States and August 31, 2021. Under the terms of the amendment, we will not receive any royalties on the first $45.0 million of cumulative net sales of all products.
 
License agreement for commercialization of XIPERE in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea
 In March 2020, we entered into the Arctic License Agreement and granted an exclusive license to Arctic Vision to develop, distribute, promote, market and commercialize XIPERE, subject to specified exceptions, in the Arctic Territory. Under the terms of the Arctic License Agreement, neither party may commercialize XIPERE in the other party’s territory. Arctic Vision has agreed to use commercially reasonably efforts to pursue development and commercialization of XIPERE for indications associated with uveitis in the Arctic Territory. In addition, upon receipt of the Company’s consent, Arctic Vision will have the right, but not the obligation, to develop and commercialize XIPERE for additional indications in the Arctic Territory.
 Pursuant to the Arctic License Agreement, Arctic Vision agreed to pay us up to a total of $35.5 million. This amount included an upfront payment of $4.0 million as well as an aggregate of up to $31.5 million in development milestone payments for specified events prior to and including receipt of approval of XIPERE in the United States and sales milestone payments for achievement of specified levels of net sales. Further, during the applicable royalty term, we will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties of 10% to 12% of net sales based on achieving certain annual net sales thresholds in the Arctic Territory, subject to customary reductions, payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, commencing at launch in such country and lasting until the latest of (i) the date that all valid claims within the licensed patent rights covering XIPERE have expired, (ii) the date of the loss of marketing or regulatory exclusivity of XIPERE in a given country or (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of XIPERE in a given country.

XIPERE Phase 3 clinical trial data
 In PEACHTREE, a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of XIPERE administered through the SCS in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. PEACHTREE was conducted at 63 investigational sites and enrolled 160 patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis, randomized either to a treatment arm consisting of 96 patients who received a 4.0 mg dose of XIPERE or to a sham injection procedure arm consisting of 64 patients. We used a sham injection procedure as a comparator for XIPERE, as opposed to an active drug, because there were no approved therapies for macular edema associated with uveitis against which to compare XIPERE, and there were no controlled, randomized trials with data in patients who could be used as an appropriate comparator arm. 
 PEACHTREE was the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a drug candidate for patients with uveitic macular edema in which improvement in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, was the primary efficacy endpoint. It was also the first pivotal trial in which patients were evaluated across all types of uveitis: anterior, posterior, intermediate, and panuveitis. The trial met its primary endpoint with 47% of patients who received XIPERE every 12 weeks gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA as measured using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, scale, from baseline at week 24, compared to 16% of patients who underwent a sham procedure. This difference was statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001. All key secondary and additional endpoints of the PEACHTREE trial were also achieved. 
 XIPERE was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial. Through 24 weeks, corticosteroid-related elevated IOP adverse events were reported for approximately 11.5% of patients in the treatment arm, compared to 15.6% of patients in the control arm, when including patients who received corticosteroid rescue medication. Specifically, 72% of patients in the control arm were administered rescue medication, with 37 of the 46 receiving intravitreal or periocular corticosteroid injections, such as intravitreal OZURDEX and periocular and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Of those 37 control arm patients receiving local corticosteroid rescue medication, 10 patients, or 27%, experienced elevated IOP adverse events. In the PeriOcular and INTravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema Trial (POINT) Study, a recent National Eye Institute clinical trial studying the effect of current commercial treatments on macular edema associated with uveitis, over 30% of uveitis patients who received intravitreal steroid injections experienced steroid-related elevated IOP adverse events and received treatments to lower IOP. The reduced number of IOP adverse events in the XIPERE-treated patients in PEACHTREE suggest an IOP-sparing benefit, possibly due to the unique compartmentalization and ocular distribution of the drug inherent to administration via suprachoroidal injection. Preclinical studies investigating suprachoroidal administration support this assertion, with low corticosteroid exposure observed within the anterior chamber and trabecular meshwork. 
 In PEACHTREE, adverse events involving changes in cataract grading from baseline were similar in each arm, with approximately 7.3% and 6.3% of patients in the treatment arm and control arm showing adverse event changes in cataract grading, respectively. Further, no cataract surgeries resulted from this trial. Three serious adverse events occurred in the trial, all of which were identified in the CLS-TA arm: sialadenitis, posttraumatic compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebral body, and a retinal detachment approximately 8 weeks after the injection procedure. None of these serious adverse events were deemed treatment related by the study investigator or led to study discontinuation.
 In January 2020, results of the PEACHTREE trial were published in Ophthalmology, the peer-reviewed journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
 In MAGNOLIA, our extension trial of PEACHTREE, we followed 28 of the 96 patients who were in the treatment arm of PEACHTREE across 22 clinical sites for six additional months without protocol-directed treatment to better understand XIPERE’s long-term clinical profile. In MAGNOLIA, 50% of XIPERE-treated subjects maintained a mean improvement of 12.1 letters in BCVA from baseline through 36 additional weeks after their second suprachoroidal injection of XIPERE without requiring additional treatment.
 In AZALEA, a Phase 3 safety trial, an additional 38 patients with non-infectious uveitis were enrolled in order to collect additional safety information required for our NDA submission. These patients were administered XIPERE at baseline and at week 12 and evaluated every 4 weeks after initial treatment, with a final evaluation at week 24. XIPERE was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial.
 In 2018, we were conducting SAPPHIRE, a Phase 3 trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of XIPERE together with intravitreal Eylea (aflibercept) in patients with RVO. We were also conducting TOPAZ, the companion Phase 3 trial to the SAPPHIRE trial assessing the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal XIPERE together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent (either Lucentis, ranibizumab, or Avastin, bevacizumab) in patients with RVO. In November 2018, we announced that the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating XIPERE together with intravitreal Eylea in patients with RVO was not achieved, and we discontinued the SAPPHIRE and TOPAZ trials at that time.

CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension)
 Our most advanced internal development program is our proprietary suspension of axitinib for suprachoroidal injection, which we refer to as CLS-AX. CLS-AX is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2 and -3 that we believe may benefit patients who respond suboptimally to current anti-VEGF therapies. We are developing CLS-AX for administration to the SCS as a long-acting therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, commonly referred to as wet AMD, a retinal degenerative disease that causes a progressive loss of central vision. 
 AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults over 55 years old in developed countries. Approximately 11 million individuals in the United States are affected with AMD, with a global prevalence of 170 million. Aging is the greatest risk factor; therefore, the United States prevalence of AMD is anticipated to increase to 22 million by 2050, while the global prevalence is expected to increase to 288 million by 2040. An estimated 10% to 15% of people with AMD will develop the wet form, which refers to the advanced neovascular stage of the disease in which blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the macula and damage photoreceptor cells. Wet AMD often progresses rapidly and causes substantial loss of central vision if left untreated. Current wet AMD therapy has a ceiling of efficacy as increased dosage or more intense regimens yield limited or no additional visual benefit and require adherence to a regimen of frequent injections. This treatment burden is further highlighted by recent large “real-world” retrospective studies of wet AMD which underscore the difficulty in adhering to regimens. These real-world studies demonstrate that patients are undertreated, receiving only 6 to 7 injections per year on average, resulting in mean improvement of only one to three letters in visual acuity after one year of treatment. The current anti-VEGF market for the treatment of retinal diseases consists predominantly of several drugs that generated aggregate 2020 sales of approximately $14.3 billion globally. 
 CLS-AX combines our proprietary suspension of axitinib delivered via our SCS Microinjector.  Based on preclinical data in multiple species, we believe that suprachoroidal injection of CLS-AX could benefit patients to yield potential safety, efficacy and durability benefits.
 Axitinib is a TKI currently approved to treat renal cell cancer. Because it is a well-characterized small molecule instead of a novel complex biologic, we believe there is potential for less immune response and inflammation compared to some new, contemporary biologic agents. Also, compared to other TKIs, axitinib has shown better biocompatibility with ocular cells, including retinal pigment epithelial cells, which may potentially translate to safety benefits. Importantly, we believe that our unique route of SCS administration for CLS-AX, which is compartmentalized to the site of disease, may minimize treatment related adverse events, such as vitreous floaters, snow globe or corneal off-target effects seen with other TKI administration techniques. 
 With its broad VEGF blockade, we believe axitinib may have efficacy advantages over existing retinal therapies, which predominantly focus on VEGF-A blockade and may upregulate other forms of VEGF. Axitinib achieves pan-VEGF blockade by acting at a different level of the angiogenesis cascade, directly inhibiting VEGF receptors-1, -2, and -3 with high potency and specificity. In preclinical studies, axitinib was observed to be greater than ten times more potent than other TKIs. In multiple preclinical animal studies conducted by independent investigators, axitinib has inhibited corneal, retinal and choroidal angiogenesis.  In addition, in preclinical models, axitinib more effectively inhibited and regressed experimental corneal neovascularization than other TKIs.
 In our internal preclinical studies, CLS-AX delivered through suprachoroidal injection was well tolerated and showed durability over several months. This could lead to a longer lasting, highly effective treatment that may reduce the number of treatments and visits required for wet AMD patients to achieve optimal results.
 In preclinical studies with our CLS-AX suspension of axitinib delivered via suprachoroidal injection, we have shown up to eleven times higher drug levels in affected tissues versus intravitreal administration of the same dose of axitinib. Therefore, suprachoroidal delivery of CLS-AX has the potential to compartmentalize therapy away from unaffected tissues for potential safety benefits and target the affected chorioretinal tissue layers for potential efficacy benefits. 
 Other TKIs have shown biologic effect in wet AMD clinical trials when delivered systemically, topically and intravitreally.  However, each of these routes of administration have been associated with off-target effects. Consequently, a limitation of TKIs may be associated with the delivery of the drug and not a result of the mechanism of action.
 In August 2020, we announced that the FDA had accepted our IND for CLS-AX. In January 2021, we announced the enrollment of our first patient in OASIS, a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of CLS-AX in patients with wet AMD. OASIS is an open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of CLS-AX administered through suprachoroidal injection following two or more prior treatments with aflibercept, an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent, dosed at screening. The primary endpoint for the trial will assess the safety and tolerability of CLS-AX for the three months following the administration of CLS-AX, and secondary endpoints will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, visual function, ocular anatomy and the need for additional treatment with intravitreal aflibercept during the three-month period. 
 Patient inclusion criteria for enrollment in OASIS include: active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD; two or more anti-VEGF treatments with a meaningful response in the four months preceding the screening visit with a meaningful response; and best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, score of ≥ 20 letters (20/400) and ≤ 75 letters (20/32) with < 5 letters change

between screening and baseline to ensure patient stability after anti-VEGF treatment. Patients are then assessed at weeks four, eight and twelve. Patients will be assessed for additional therapy if they experience any of the following: (1) loss of 10 or more letters in BCVA compared to the best prior study-assessed BCVA in the study eye that is attributed to intra- or sub-retinal fluid observed by the investigator; or (2) increase in central subfield retinal thickness greater than 75 microns from baseline at visit 2 in the study eye; or (3) presence of vison-threatening hemorrhage due to AMD in the study eye. The trial design consists of three cohorts of five patients each. Cohort 1 participants will receive the lowest dose, 0.03 mg of axitinib delivered via suprachoroidal injection. Dose escalation will then proceed following review of the safety data by the Safety Monitoring Committee for the trial and their recommendation to advance to the next higher dose cohort. 
 On March 2, 2021, we announced the completion of patient dosing for the first cohort and expect to announce initial safety data from this cohort in mid-2021.
 
Gene Therapy
 We believe our platform offers the potential for safer, targeted ocular gene therapy without some of the risks of surgery and subretinal administration. Suprachoroidal administration of gene therapy could ultimately enhance access to care because it does not require specialized gene therapy surgery treatment centers. The procedure for suprachoroidal injection is conducted in an office setting and is similar in terms of patient preparation and duration to the procedure for intravitreal injection.  Therefore, we believe our products could be incorporated into retina specialists’ standard medical practice.
 During the past several years, gene therapy has demonstrated in preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by third parties that genetic material can be effectively and tolerably introduced to the retinal tissues, most often using an AAV. Safe and reproducible delivery of gene therapy vector into the subretinal space is essential for successful targeting of the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, and photoreceptor rods or cones. Currently, the only approved retinal gene therapy and most investigational retinal gene therapies are delivered via retinal surgery at a limited number of specialized ocular gene therapy treatment centers. During the pars plana vitrectomy surgery, the surgeon creates a small hole in the retina to inject the gene therapy beneath the retina to the subretinal space without tearing or damaging the retina and macula. This process creates a small retinal detachment, which separates and exposes the photoreceptors and RPE to the gene therapy.  The retina is in a disease state and already compromised, and the procedure carries iatrogenic risk. However, the success of this surgery is critical for the clinical efficacy of retinal gene therapy. Consequently, the surgery requires extensive training and the limited number of specialized ocular gene therapy centers creates patient access issues. Unlike vitrectomy, suprachoroidal administration does not require detachment of the photoreceptors from the RPE, and consequently, avoids the risk of iatrogenic subretinal injection to an already-compromised retina. Suprachoroidal injection procedure training is minimal and could ultimately enhance access to care because it would not have to be administered at a specialized gene therapy surgery treatment center.
 Inherited retinal diseases, or IRDs, such as Stargardt disease and Usher syndrome, represent some of the most challenging diseases that ophthalmologists encounter. They cause progressive, relentless vision loss due to changes in genes critical to the survival of photoreceptors and RPE cells, yet delivery of therapeutics to these cells is challenging. In preclinical animal studies from which data was presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology 2019 Annual Meeting in October 2019, the suprachoroidal injection of luciferase DNA nanoparticles, or DNPs, in rabbits produced activity comparable to that seen from subretinal injections of luciferase DNPs. In these studies, SCS injections of DNPs were generally well tolerated across both rabbits and non-human primates, and no significant abnormalities were observed on ophthalmic exams. DNPs can also transfer large genes at potentially higher doses without the risks of subretinal surgery, which may allow for gene therapy in some of the most common IRDs. 
 We believe suprachoroidal administration may further enhance the value proposition of ocular gene therapy by potentially improving safety and expanding access. In preclinical studies we have observed that SCS injection can administer both viral and non-viral gene therapy. Using marker genes like green fluorescent protein and luciferase in both rabbits and non-human primates, gene therapy was delivered with our SCS injection to achieve expression in the retina and choroid. 
 We have also expanded the reach of our SCS Microinjector technology in gene therapy through a development and commercial partner. In August 2019, we entered into an option and license agreement with REGENXBIO, pursuant to which we granted REGENXBIO an exclusive option, or the Option, to enter into a commercial license agreement granting REGENXBIO an exclusive, worldwide and sublicensable license to our SCS Microinjector for the delivery of AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy and other conditions for which anti-VEGF treatment is currently the standard of care. REGENXBIO exercised the Option on October 29, 2019 and paid us an option fee equal to $2.0 million less $0.5 million received under a prior technology access agreement. Under the license agreement, REGENXBIO has agreed to make additional payments to us of up to an aggregate of $34.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and up to $102.0 million in sales-based milestone payments, as well as mid-single digit royalties on net sales of products using the SCS Microinjector during the royalty term.
 11

REGENXBIO will be responsible for all development, regulatory and commercialization activities for their gene therapy product candidates. We will be responsible for supplying the SCS Microinjector in support of REGENXBIO’s preclinical studies, clinical studies and commercial use.
 
Ocular Oncology
 On July 9, 2019, we entered into a worldwide licensing agreement with Aura for the use of our SCS Microinjector to deliver Aura’s proprietary drug candidates into the SCS for the potential treatment of certain ocular cancers, including choroidal melanoma. If the collaboration proves successful following preclinical and proof-of-concept studies, Aura may utilize the SCS Microinjector for certain future development programs. Pursuant to the licensing agreement, we are eligible to receive payments related to pre-specified development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as royalties on product sales that utilize the SCS Microinjector.
Manufacturing
 We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We utilize CMOs to formulate and produce our drug candidates and to produce our SCS Microinjector used for our clinical trials. We procure active pharmaceutical ingredients for our drugs from third-party suppliers. We expect to utilize third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs and SCS Microinjector, if approved.
 On May 8, 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Gerresheimer Regensburg GmbH to supply our SCS Microinjector. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the Gerresheimer agreement has an initial term of five years, after which it renews in three-year increments unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least one year in advance. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The Gerresheimer agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Gerresheimer with current Good Manufacturing Practices, regulations promulgated by the FDA, confidentiality and other customary matters for an agreement of this nature. We anticipate entering into commercial supply agreements with our other suppliers at a later date.
 
Commercialization 
 We have entered into exclusive license agreements for the commercialization and development of XIPERE with Bausch in the United States and Canada and with Arctic Vision in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea. We may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions. If any of our future product candidates, including CLS-AX, are approved by the applicable regulatory authorities, we may either commercialize those product candidates ourselves or through license or collaboration agreements with third parties.
Competition  
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 
XIPERE faces competition from other commercially available forms of TA and other topical, injectable and implantable corticosteroids. Bristol-Myers Squibb markets TA under the brand name Kenalog. Kenalog is indicated only for intramuscular or intraarticular injection; however, it is used off-label for intraocular inflammation using intravitreal and periocular administration. There are also a number of generic equivalents of Kenalog. In addition, Alcon’s injectable TA, Triesence, is approved in the United States for the treatment of uveitis and other inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids, although it is not indicated for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis or RVO. OZURDEX, marketed by Allergan, is a bioerodable extended release implant that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone and is approved for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye and for macular edema due to RVO in both the United States and in the European Union, and received approval from the FDA to treat diabetic macular edema, or DME. 
 Additionally, our collaborator Bausch markets Retisert, an intravitreal implant of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. Eyepoint Pharmaceuticals markets Yutiq, an injectable form of fluocinolone acetonide for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. 
 12

Axitinib, also known by its brand name Inlyta, is currently marketed by Pfizer and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, but not for any ophthalmology indications. Our product candidate, CLS-AX, could also compete with anti-VEGF drugs, which are the current standard of care for RVO and wet AMD. Genentech’s products Lucentis and Avastin are both anti-VEGF antibodies. Lucentis is currently approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO, and diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. Avastin is an anti-VEGF drug used off-label by uveitis and retina specialists in both the United States and in certain countries of the European Union for the treatment of numerous retinal diseases, but it is not indicated for ophthalmic use. In the United States, Regeneron’s anti-VEGF product, Eylea, is approved for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO and diabetic retinopathy. In the European Union, Eylea is approved for the treatment of wet AMD and RVO. Novartis’ Beovu was recently approved for the treatment of wet AMD in the United States, and has been recommended for approval in the European Union at a recent meeting of European Medicines Agency’s drug evaluation committee.
 Axitinib may also compete with other drug candidates in development in other forms for ocular use and other development candidates for wet AMD. Companies developing potentially competitive TKIs for ocular use are Ocular Therapeutics, Graybug and Eyepoint. We expect that other established companies in the ocular space will seek to develop new products with the goal of superior efficacy and duration over the current standard of care.  
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient recruitment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs before we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or obtaining FDA market exclusivity, thereby delaying our product approvals. Competitors’ patent protection could also potentially delay FDA approval of our product candidates for up to 30 months, and we may still be subject to potential patent litigation that might arise beyond the 30 months. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our technologies and methods of accessing the SCS, drug candidates and formulations as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for novel applications, uses, and technological innovations related to our drug candidates, proprietary delivery devices and core technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 Patents and patent applications 
 Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 22 granted U.S. patents broadly directed to devices and methods of administering drugs into the SCS by injection, including one design patent. In addition, our patent estate includes two allowed U.S. patent applications, 15 patent applications pending in the United States, 61 issued foreign patents and three allowed foreign patents, two pending international PCT applications and 49 patent applications pending in major international markets, including the European Union, Canada, India, Japan, China and Australia, relating to our SCS delivery technology, as well as the formulations of our current therapeutic drug candidates and delivery device. Of these patents and patent applications, we license seven of the 22 issued U.S. patents, 5 pending U.S. applications, 19 of the issued foreign patents and one of the allowed foreign patents, and seven foreign patent applications in major international markets, each relating to methods of delivering drugs to the eye by microneedle administration, pursuant to a license agreement with Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Emory University that is described below. With respect to in-licensed international PCT applications, according to the terms of the license agreement, we advise Georgia Tech and Emory regarding the countries in which patent applications should be pursued. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, our issued in-licensed U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2027 and 2029, without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or extensions. Applications relating to SCS delivery technology and methods, our current therapeutic drug candidates and formulations, various therapeutic uses, including treatment of specific indications such as macular edema 
 13

associated with uveitis and RVO, wet AMD as well as DME and improvement of specified clinical parameters, are expected to expire, if issued, between 2027 and 2041, without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be extended by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. 
 Our product candidates are protected against genericization through numerous patents. In the case of XIPERE injected into the SCS, an applicant who files a paragraph 4 Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA certifying they may circumvent our patents must also demonstrate comparability of the proposed drug, which we believe may require a clinical trial in macular edema associated with uveitis, against our product, unless a biowaiver is obtained. 
 Third-party patent filings 
 Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products, including patents and applications related to surgical methods of accessing the SCS and certain formulations of TA. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. 
 Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is novel and nonobvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. 
 License agreement with Emory and Georgia Tech 
 We have entered into a license agreement with Emory University, or Emory, and the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, or GTRC, under which we received a worldwide exclusive license to specified patents relating to methods and devices for drug delivery using a microinjector. The field of the license covers all ophthalmic uses of the microinjector for mammals and birds. Under this license agreement, we have agreed to direct all prosecution of intellectual property to the licensors’ patent counsel and have agreed to pay for all intellectual property expenses associated with the licensed patents. 
 In addition to upfront and milestone payments of $65,000 in the aggregate made to date, the license agreement requires us to make a $75,000 milestone payment upon the occurrence of a specified event relating to the commercialization of a drug developed using the licensed patents. On July 1, 2018 and 2019, we paid Emory and GTRC $75,000 and $50,000, respectively, to extend the date by which we may achieve the commercialization milestone. We are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $25,000, which will continue until the first commercial sale of a product covered by the licensed patents. Additionally, we will owe a low single-digit royalty on any worldwide net product sales related to the licensed patents, with minimum annual royalties starting at $15,000 per year after commercialization. The minimum annual royalty increases each year after the first commercial sale, up to a maximum amount of $100,000 per year in the sixth calendar year and in subsequent years. 
 We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of products related to the licensed patients. We are obligated to provide Emory and GTRC a written report detailing our activities related to the development and commercialization of products twice a year. 
 Royalties are calculated based on net sales of products covered by a patent licensed under the agreement, and are due on each such product sold as long as the patent covering that particular product is valid and unexpired. Unless otherwise terminated pursuant to its termination provisions, this license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents. We have the right to terminate this license agreement at any time upon 60 days’ written notice to Emory and GTRC. Emory and GTRC may also terminate this license agreement in the event of a material breach by us. This license agreement will immediately terminate if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents in a court or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction.

Trademarks, trade secrets and know-how 
 Our trademark portfolio currently consists of two registered trademarks in Australia and Korea, two registered trademarks in Russia, two registered trademarks in Singapore, six registered trademarks in Brazil, five registered trademarks in Canada, six registered trademarks in China, four registered trademarks in the European Union, two registered trademarks in each of India and New Zealand, two registered trademarks in Japan, three registered trademarks in Israel, seven registered trademarks in Mexico, four registered and three pending applications in South Africa, five registered trademarks in the United States and two pending applications in the United States and two registered trademarks in the United Kingdom.  We also have two international registrations: the first with pending extensions of protection to Australia, Japan, Mexico and registered in the European Union, India, New Zealand, Korea and Singapore, and the second with extensions of protection pending in India and Mexico and registered in Australia, China, European Union, Israel, Japan, Korea, Russia, and Singapore. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and employees. These and other agreements, such as invention assignment agreements, grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
 
Government regulation  
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. While it may be the case that when a drug and a device are used together, which is called a combination product, the FDA typically regulates the dispenser of a drug, such as a syringe co-packaged with a drug, as a drug itself. 
 In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. 
 Drugs 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 

• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


• | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA or an independent institutional review board, or IRB, may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant health risks arise. 
 15

In the United States, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following: 
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 
 Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval. 
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, although waivers may be granted and exemptions apply in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. 
 Review of application 
 Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. This is typically 10 months from the date of submission for drugs that are not new molecular entities, such as our product candidates. The review process can be expedited if priority review is granted.  In such a case, the FDA review period is only 6 months.  Alternatively, the FDA review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. The device component of our products will also be subject to review as part of the NDA review process and its manufacturers subject to inspection for compliance with device cGMPs embodied in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. The FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a CRL, detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and 
 16

approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for approved products, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, a medication guide, special training for prescribers and dispensers, and patient registries. 
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved devices or drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs, device cGMPs embodied in the QSR and combination product cGMPs that, for drug/device combination products, specify the requirements within the drug cGMPs and the QSR with which manufacturers must comply. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including without limitation the FDCA, the federal civil False Claims Act, other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. 
 The Hatch-Waxman amendments 
 Our regulatory strategy is to pursue development of our drugs as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs under the FDCA. As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Therefore, if we can satisfy the conditions required for a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submission, it may eliminate the need for us to conduct some of the preclinical studies or clinical trials for the new product candidate that might otherwise have been required, although the review 
 17

time is not shortened. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require us to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. 
 Orange Book listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification. 
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners file patent litigation directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. 
 Non-patent exclusivity 
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. 
 A drug, including one approved under a 505(b)(2) application, may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period. A 505(b)(2) NDA may also be subject to a five-year exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, whereby the FDA will not accept for filing, with limited exception, a product seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety or effectiveness for such new chemical entity. 
 Orphan drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan drugs are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug’s showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In addition, doctors may prescribe products for off-label uses and undermine our exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same active moiety for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. 
 18

We do not plan to pursue orphan drug designation for XIPERE for the treatment of uveitis in the United States. However, we may seek designation for other products in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain orphan drug designation for any products in any jurisdiction. Even if we are able to obtain orphan drug designation for a product, we cannot be sure that such product will be approved, that we will be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, if ever, or that we will be able to maintain any exclusivity that is granted. 
 Foreign regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Federal and state fraud and abuse, data privacy and security and transparency laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Therefore, even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend ourselves against enforcement or litigation due to the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in life sciences companies in the United States and some of the applicable laws are broad in scope.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. 
 19

The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The federal criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal and civil statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 
 Under HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including certain health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and their regulations, including the omnibus final rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access, or otherwise process protected health information. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules.  New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well. 
 In the EU/EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, went into effect on May 25, 2018 and replaced Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Privacy Directive).  The GDPR applies to identified or identifiable personal data processed by automated means (for example, a computer database of customers) and data contained in, or intended to be part of, non-automated filing systems (traditional paper files) as well as transfer of such data to a country outside of the EU/EEA. The GDPR extends the geographical scope of EU data protection law to entities and operations outside of the EU/EEA under certain conditions and imposes substantial obligations upon companies and new rights for individuals, and by certain EU Member State-level legislation. Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.  The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and creates additional rights for data subjects. In addition, the GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we may process, and we may be required to put in place additional measures in an effort to comply with the GDPR and with other laws and regulations in the EU, including those of EU Member States, relating to privacy and data protection. This may be onerous and if our efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable EU laws and regulations are not successful, or are perceived to be unsuccessful, it could adversely affect our business in the EU.

Further, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which enabled the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. for companies that had self-certified to the Privacy Shield in July 2020. The ECJ decision also raised questions about the continued validity of one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, and EU regulators have issued additional guidance regarding considerations and requirements that we and other companies must consider and undertake when using the Standard Contractual Clauses. Although the EU has presented a new draft set of contractual clauses, at present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses. To the extent that we were to rely on the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs, we will not be able to do so in the future, and the ECJ’s decision and other regulatory guidance or developments otherwise may impose additional obligations with respect to the transfer of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., each of which could restrict our activities in those jurisdictions, limit our ability to provide our products and services in those jurisdictions, or increase our costs and obligations and impose limitations upon our ability to efficiently transfer personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S.
 Additionally, in June 2016, United Kingdom voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which could also lead to 
further legislative and regulatory changes. In March 2017, the United Kingdom began the process to leave the EU by April 2019.  Under the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, the UK and EU have agreed that transfers of personal data to the UK from EEA member states will not be treated as ‘restricted transfers’ to a non-EEA country for a period of up to four months from January 1, 2021, plus a potential further two months extension (the “Extended Adequacy Assessment Period”). Although the current maximum duration of the Extended Adequacy Assessment Period is six months, it may end sooner, for example, in the event that the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of the UK, or the UK amends the UK GDPR and/or makes certain changes regarding data transfers under the UK GDPR/Data Protection Act 2018 without the consent of the EU (unless those amendments or decisions are made simply to keep relevant UK laws aligned with the EU’s data protection regime). If the European Commission does not adopt an ‘adequacy decision’ in respect of the UK prior to the expiry of the Extended Adequacy Assessment Period, from that point onwards the UK will be an ‘inadequate third country’ under the GDPR and transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will require a ‘transfer mechanism’ such as the Standard Contractual Clauses. Beginning in 2021, the UK will be a “third country” under the GDPR. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.
 Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States.  Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households.  Effective January 1, 2020, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 In addition, it is anticipated that the CCPA will be expanded on January 1, 2023, when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) becomes operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, provide for increased penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new. Although there are limited exemptions for clinical trial data under the CCPA, the CCPA and other similar laws could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted.
 With the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other state and Federal laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy and data protection imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other obligations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors or service providers, violate applicable laws or regulations or our policies, such violations may also put our or our customers’ data at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Additionally, a trend has continued of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and/or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will 
 21

also be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer and device manufacturer marketing practices, require registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs, or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to particular types of healthcare professionals and entities.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health care laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 The physicians who use our product candidates, if approved, may be reimbursed by third-party payors for both the suprachoroidal injection using our SCS Microinjector and for the drug itself. On July 1, 2016, the American Medical Association, or AMA, approved a new Category III Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code for the suprachoroidal injection of pharmacologic agents. Category III codes are a set of temporary codes maintained by the AMA for emerging technology, services and procedures. Payment for these services or procedures are based on the coverage policies of individual third-party payors, including private insurers and government-funded programs, like Medicare, and Medicare administrative contractors. We believe obtaining a separate CPT code for the use of our products is critical to maximizing our commercial success. There is no guarantee that these billing codes or the payment amounts, if any, associated with such codes will not change in the future. 
 Our strategy will include efforts to engage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and reimbursement that will facilitate access to our product candidates and the SCS injection procedure as we expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our product candidates are administered and for the drugs themselves. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for the procedures to administer our product candidates or for the product candidates themselves, or adverse changes in third-party payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. 
 In the U.S., third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. Failure to obtain favorable coverage policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, third-party payors from time to time update reimbursement amounts and also revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physicians for the procedures performed administering our products, which could directly impact the demand for any of our product candidates that may be approved. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to 
physician payments, which is done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. However, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula and established a quality payment program, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. The quality payment program has two tracks, one known as the merit-based incentive payment system for providers in the fee-for service Medicare program, and the advanced alternative payment model for providers in specific care models, such as accountable care organizations. In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the Quality Payment Program will 
 22

impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our products or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our products could materially affect our business. 
 Healthcare reform 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 
 For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. 
 The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act’s mandated medical device tax and “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made. Further, although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug 
 23

pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and implemented others under its existing authority. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021.  On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
