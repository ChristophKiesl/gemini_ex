ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
We are one of the largest public homebuilders in the United States. We are also a land developer, with a portfolio of lifestyle and master-planned communities. We provide a diverse assortment of homes across a wide range of price points. We strive to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers in traditionally high growth markets, where we design, build and sell single-family detached and attached homes. We operate under the Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding, LLC (“TMHF”) and title insurance and closing settlement services through our title company, Inspired Title Services, LLC (“Inspired Title”).
We have operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina and Texas. Our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating divisions and a mortgage and title services division, which are managed as multiple reportable segments, as follows:

East | Atlanta, Charlotte, North Florida, Raleigh, Southwest Florida, and Tampa 
Central | Austin, Dallas, and Houston (each of the Dallas and Houston markets include both a Taylor Morrison division and a Darling Homes division)
West | Bay Area, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Southern California 
Mortgage Operations | Taylor Morrison Home Funding (“TMHF”) and Inspired Title Services, LLC (“Inspired Title”) 

Our long-term strategy is built on four pillars:

• | pursuing core locations;


• | building distinctive communities;


• | maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and


• | appropriately balancing price with pace in the sale of our homes.

We are committed to building authentic homes and engaging communities that inspire, delight and enhance the lives of our customers. Delivering on this commitment involves thoughtful design and analysis to accommodate the needs of our customers and the surrounding community. The Taylor Morrison difference begins with providing our customers with homes that are both conducive to their lifestyles and that are built to last. We take pride in our quality construction, superior design and customer service. Our dedication to customer service defines our customer experience and acknowledges homeowners’ suggestions to incorporate style, quality and sustainability into every community we build. Our commitment to quality prioritizes the long-term satisfaction of our homeowners. Our communities are typically built in locations in close proximity to schools and shopping, often have amenities and public gathering areas, with a focus on delivering superior lifestyles to customers and their families.
In recognition of our commitment to home buyers, we were awarded America’s Most Trusted Home Builder® by Lifestory Research in 2016 and 2017, which is based on the reviews of more than 30,000 consumers. We are also ranked the second highest in the active adult resort home builder brands according to Lifestory Research America’s Most Trusted® 2016 and 2017 Active Adult Home Builder Brand Study, which was based on almost 11,000 consumers.
Some of our recent acquisitions include our acquisition in April 2015 of JEH Homes, an Atlanta based homebuilder, for a purchase price of approximately $63.2 million, excluding contingent consideration, which yielded approximately 2,000 lots; our acquisition in July 2015 of three divisions of Orleans Homes for a purchase price of approximately $167.3 million, which collectively yielded approximately 2,100 lots in new markets within Charlotte, Chicago and Raleigh, further expanding our geographic footprint; and our acquisition in January 2016 of Acadia Homes in Atlanta for approximately $83.6 million, which yielded approximately 1,100 additional lots with deliveries of homes at price points in the low $400 thousands, allowing us to further diversify our product offerings in the Atlanta market. All the operations acquired in 2015 and 2016 have been fully transitioned to the Taylor Morrison brand.
During 2016, our operations were located in eight states and generated revenue of $3.55 billion, net income from continuing operations of $207.0 million. In 2016, we grew our average community count by 19% year over year to 309 active communities, and ended 2016 with $1.5 billion in sales order backlog.
We believe we benefit from a well-located land portfolio, primarily in homebuilding markets that have been leading the U.S. housing recovery. During 2016, we had 309 average active communities and at December 31, 2016 we owned or controlled approximately 38,300 lots. The average sales price of homes closed during the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $465,000. During 2016, we sold 7,504 homes, an increase of 12% over the prior year.

2016 Highlights and Recent Developments

• | On January 8, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Acadia Homes in Atlanta, Georgia, yielding approximately 1,100 lots for total consideration of $83.6 million.


• | On August 10, 2016, we announced our expansion of the Taylor Morrison brand to the Dallas market. Sales for this new division are expected to begin in 2017 with the opening of two communities offering homes in the $300,000 - $500,000 price range. 


• | On February 6, 2017 we completed the sale of 11,500,000 shares of our Class A common stock in a registered public offering at a net purchase price per share of $18.2875 (the public offering price to the public of $19.00 per share less the underwriters’ discount). We used all of the net proceeds from the public offering to purchase partnership units in New TMM, our direct subsidiary, along with shares of our Class B common stock, held by our Principal Equityholders (as defined below). The aggregate number partnership units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock we purchased was equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the public offering. See — Our Structure and Note 23 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further detail. 

Business Strategy
We recognize that the housing market is cyclical and home price volatility between the peak and valley of cycles can be significant. We seek to maximize shareholder value over the long-term and operate our business to capitalize on market appreciation value and mitigate risks from market downturns. We believe we are well positioned for growth throughout market fluctuations through disciplined execution of the four pillars of our business strategy.
We execute our strategy by opportunistically acquiring prime land assets in core locations, focusing on the preferences of our buyers, building distinctive communities, continually evaluating and analyzing overhead efficiency and optimizing profit by managing volume. We regularly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder return. We also take advantage of opportunities to partner in joint ventures as they arise in order to secure desirable land, share risk and maximize returns.
We believe our extensive land position and pipeline, located in highly desirable submarkets, have positioned us for strategic growth and increased profitability in an improving housing market. We execute this strategy by:

• | Strategically opening new communities from existing land supply;


• | Combining land acquisition and development expertise with homebuilding operations;


• | Focusing product offerings on specific customer groups;


• | Building aspirational homes for our customers and delivering superior customer service;


• | Maintaining an efficient capital structure;


• | Selectively pursuing acquisitions; and


• | Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record.

We focus on developing “lifestyle” communities in core locations, which have many distinguishing attributes, including proximity to job centers, strong school systems and a variety of local amenities in well-regarded submarkets. We offer a range of award-winning and innovative designs, through our single-family detached and attached product lines. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency and cost savings to reduce the impact on the environment. Although many of the communities we build primarily attract move-up buyers, our portfolio also includes quality products for entry-level, luxury and 55+ customers. We serve all segments and generational groups through our homes and focus on the needs of homebuyers. The distribution of sales in our portfolio have gravitated toward a mix of approximately a third of entry-level and first time home buyers, a third of move-up buyers and a third of 55+ buyers. 
We strive to maintain product and price level differentiation through market and customer research. We target a balance of regional market portfolios across a variety of demographics. Our ability to build at multiple price points enables us to respond to changing consumer preferences and address shifts in affordability. We also use key indicators of market specific supply and demand characteristics to determine an optimal matching of consumer groups and specific land position.
3

We generally operate as community developers. Community development includes the acquisition and development of communities, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. In some communities we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case, we acquire fully planned and entitled lots and may construct on-site improvements but normally do not construct significant off-site utility or infrastructure improvements. We develop a wide range of communities, which may include amenity rich community centers. We also have investments in, and are participants in, a number of joint ventures to develop land and master-planned communities.
We develop a number of home designs with features such as single-story, ranch style living, split bedroom plans and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to varied buyer needs. We have integrated these designs and features in many of our homes and communities. We engage unaffiliated architectural firms and internal architectural resources to develop new designs and augment existing plans in order to ensure that our homes reflect current and local consumer tastes. We possess an extensive library of single-family detached and attached floor plans that can be utilized throughout our markets.
The life cycle of a community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of land, continuing through the land development phase, and concluding with the sale, construction, and delivery of homes. Actual community life cycle will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as developed lots.

Land Acquisition Policies and Development
Locating and acquiring suitable land positions is a core part of our strategy as a developer and homebuilder. In order to maximize our expected risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Our portfolio investment committee of senior executives meets on a regular basis. Annually, our operating divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographies. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Supply and demand are analyzed on a consumer segment and submarket basis to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary. Major development strategy decisions regarding community positioning are included in the decision making and underwriting process and are made in consultation with senior executives of our management team. Our land portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is detailed below:

Raw land represents property that has not been developed and remains in its natural state. Partially developed represents land where the grading and horizontal development process has begun. Finished lots represent those lots which we have purchased from third parties in addition to lots for which we have completed the horizontal development and are ready for the vertical development. Long-term strategic assets are those lots where we are currently not performing any development.
In the land purchasing and joint venture configuration process, specific projects of interest are typically identified by the local divisional teams, including proposed ownership structure, environmental concerns, anticipated product segmentation, competitive environment and financial returns, and they are presented to our portfolio investment committee for review. Certain portfolio opportunities will often be sourced centrally and managed at the corporate level. We also determine whether continued spending on currently owned and controlled land is a well-timed and appropriate use of capital. Our portfolio investment strategy emphasizes expected profitability to reflect the risk and timing of returns, and the level of sales volume in new and existing markets.
The following is a summary of the status of our land positions:

Homes in Inventory
We manage our inventory of homes under construction by selectively commencing construction to capture new home demand, while monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes. 
The following is a summary of our homes in inventory by homebuilding reporting segment as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Total | 3,131 | | 412 | | 1,186 | | 4,729 | | 2,932 | | 438 | 1,317 | 4,687

We expect that during 2017 we will deliver substantially all homes in backlog at December 31, 2016.
Community Development
We create a complete concept for each community, beginning with an overall community layout and then determine the size, style and price range of the homes, the layout of the streets and positioning of the individual home sites. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we improve the land by clearing and grading, installing roads, underground utility lines, staking out individual home sites and, in certain communities, erecting distinctive entrance structures and recreational amenities.
Each community has employees who perform superintendent, sales and customer service functions, in conjunction with a local management team to manage the overall project.
The construction time for our homes varies from project to project depending on geographic region, the time of year, the size and complexity of construction, the governmental approval processes, local labor availability, availability of materials and supplies, weather, and other factors. On average, we complete the construction of a typical home in approximately six months.
Procurement and Construction
We have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and national presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize efficiencies on local, regional and national levels and to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements.
6

The regional and national vendor programs currently involve over 40 vendors and includes highly reputable and well-established companies who supply us with lumber, appliances, HVAC systems, insulation, roofing, paint and lighting, among other materials. Through these relationships, we are able to realize savings on the costs of essential materials. Contracts are typically structured to include a blend of attractive upfront pricing and rebates and, in some cases, advantageous retroactive pricing in instances of contract renewals. In addition to cost advantages, these arrangements also help minimize the risk of construction delays during supply shortages, as we are often able to leverage our size to obtain our full allocation of required materials.
Trades and Labor
Our construction, land and purchasing managers coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We are a general contractor for all of our homebuilding projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices can be challenging in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth and other economic factors that affect the number of people in the workforce.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct a home. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. We generally have multiple sources for the materials we purchase and have not experienced significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials.
Sales and Marketing
We are committed to continuously enhancing our customer experience including how we target and attract our consumers. Our marketing program calls for a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our corporate sales and marketing team provides a generalized marketing framework across our regional operations as well as sales training to our local teams. Our divisional sales and marketing teams utilize local media and marketing channels to deliver a unique message that is relevant to our consumer groups in each market.
Our goal is to identify the preferences of our customers and demographic groups and offer them innovative, high-quality products that are efficient and profitable to build. To achieve this goal, we conduct extensive market research to determine preferences of our customer groups and are able to focus on particular lifestyle preferences in determining the product to build.
We are continually gathering and analyzing data regarding specific consumer preferences for various customer groups. Our approach to customer identification and segmentation guides our operations from the initial land acquisition through to our design, building, marketing and delivery of homes and our ongoing after-sales customer service. Among our peers, we believe we are at the forefront of directed marketing strategies, as evidenced by our data-driven approach to marketing and decision-making. 
The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.taylormorrison.com and www.darlinghomes.com (none of the information on or accessible through these websites is a part of this Annual Report). The main purpose of these websites is to direct potential customers to one of our sales teams. The websites also offer the ability of customers to evaluate floor plans, elevations, square footage, community amenities and geographic location. Customers are also able to use the websites to make inquiries and to receive a prompt response from one of our “Internet Home Consultants.” The websites are fully integrated with our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system. By analyzing the content of the CRM, we are able to focus our lead generation programs to deliver high-quality sales leads. With these leads we are better able to increase sale conversion rates and lower marketing costs. We believe the digital marketing strategy for our websites, which is continually reviewed and refined, provides high return on our investments. 
In addition to our website, we selectively utilize print, radio and television for advertising purposes, including directional marketing, newspapers and billboards. We also directly notify local real estate agents and firms of any new community 
7

openings in order to use the existing real estate agent/broker channels in each market. Pricing for our homes is evaluated weekly based on an analysis of market conditions, competitive environment and supply and demand characteristics.
We use furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate the advantages of the designs, features and functionality of our homes. We generally employ or contract with interior and landscape designers who create attractive model homes that highlight the features and options available for the product line within a project. Depending upon the number of homes to be built in the project and the product lines to be offered, we generally build between one and three model homes for each active selling community. 
Our homes are sold by our commissioned employees who work from sales offices generally located within our model homes. Our goal is to ensure our sales force has extensive knowledge of our homes, including our energy efficient features, sales strategies, mortgage options and community dynamics. To achieve this goal, we have on-going training for our sales team and conduct regular meetings to keep them abreast of the latest promotions, options and sales techniques and discuss geographic competition. Our sales team members are licensed real estate agents where required by law and assist our customers in adding design features to their homes, which we believe appeal to local consumer preferences. Third-party brokers who sell our homes are generally paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. In some of our divisions, we contract with third-party design studios that specialize in assisting our homebuyers with options and upgrades to personalize their homes. Utilizing these third-party design studios allows us to manage our overhead and costs more efficiently. We may also offer various sales incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades. The use, types and amount of incentives depends largely on existing economic and local competitive market conditions.
Warranty Program
We offer warranties on homes that generally provide a limited one- or two-year warranty (depending on jurisdiction) to cover various defects in workmanship or materials and structural construction defects. We may also facilitate a ten-year warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. The construction defect risk is covered by Beneva Indemnity Company (“Beneva”), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration lenders.
Competition
The homebuilding business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of location, design, quality, service, price and reputation.
In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate.
Mortgage Operations 
TMHF provides a number of mortgage-related services to our customers through our mortgage lending operations. The strategic purpose of TMHF is:

• | to utilize mortgage finance as a sales tool in the purchase process to ensure a consistent customer experience and assist in maintaining production efficiency; and


• | to control and analyze our backlog quality and to better manage projected closing and delivery dates for our customers.

TMHF operates as an independent mortgage banker and conducts its business as a FHA Full Eagle lender. TMHF funds mortgage loans utilizing warehouse credit line facilities. Revenue is earned through origination and processing fees combined with service release premiums earned in the secondary market once the loans are sold to investors. Typically, loans are sold and servicing is released within 20-30 business days.
8

TMHF competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. TMHF utilizes a multi-investor correspondent platform which gives us increased flexibility when placing loans to meet our customers’ needs. TMHF has continued to expand and strengthen our correspondent relationships. This has created stability and consistency in our origination process and delivery. 
Inspired Title operates as a title insurance agent under the title-only (examination) business model. Inspired Title searches and examines land title records, prepares title commitments and polices for homebuyers in our Florida, Georgia, and Texas markets, contracting with others (currently title insurance underwriters and attorneys) to perform the escrow closing functions. Inspired Title competes against other title underwriters and title/escrow agents that provide similar services.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal. We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. We generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Our results, therefore, may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:

• | the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects;


• | the timing of sales;


• | the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels;


• | the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction;


• | the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate;


• | mix of homes closed;


• | construction timetables;


• | the prevailing interest rates and the availability of financing, both for us and for the purchasers of our homes;


• | the cost and availability of materials and labor; and


• | weather conditions in the markets in which we build.

As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position are not necessarily representative of a full fiscal year. To illustrate the seasonality in net homes sold, homes closed and home closings revenue, a summary of the quarterly financial data follows:


 | Three Months Ended, | | Three Months Ended,
 | 2016 | | 2015 
 | March 31 | | June 30 | | September 30 | December 31 | | March 31(1) | | June 30(1) | September 30 | | December 31
Net homes sold | 24.4 | % | | 27.0 | % | 26.0 | % | | 22.6 | % | 25.9 | % | | 28.1 | % | 24.5 | % | 21.5 | %
Home closings revenue | 18.4 | % | | 24.2 | % | 23.7 | % | | 33.7 | % | 17.1 | % | | 23.6 | % | 27.0 | % | 32.3 | %
Net income from continuing operations | 12.6 | % | | 22.1 | % | 28.4 | % | | 36.9 | % | 23.5 | % | | 11.7 | % | 26.8 | % | 38.0 | %

(1) Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 was impacted by factors other than seasonality. The gain on the foreign currency forward related to the sale of our Canadian operations during the first quarter of 2015 benefited earnings, while the loss on extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2015 reduced earnings by $30.0 million and $33.3 million, respectively. 
Organizational Structure
On April 12, 2013 we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 32,857,800 shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). With an initial price to the public of $22.00 per share, it was the largest homebuilding IPO in the history of the NYSE. As a result of the completion of 
9

the IPO and a series of transactions pursuant to a Reorganization Agreement dated as of April 9, 2013, TMHC became the indirect parent of TMM Holdings Limited Partnership (“TMM Holdings”) through the formation of New TMM. TMM Holdings is a British Columbia limited partnership that acquired our operations in July 2011 and is currently the holding company for all of our operations. It was formed in 2011 by a consortium comprised of affiliates of TPG Global, LLC (the “TPG Entities” or “TPG”), investment funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) or their respective subsidiaries (together, the “Oaktree Entities”), and affiliates of JH Investments, Inc. (“JH” and together with the TPG Entities and Oaktree Entities, the “Principal Equityholders”). 
In addition to our Class A Common Stock, we have outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”). Holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval, except with respect to the amendment of certain provisions of the amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation that would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Class B Common Stock so as to affect them adversely. Such amendments must be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the shares affected by the amendment, voting as a separate class, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
For each share of TMHC Class A Common Stock outstanding, TMHC holds one limited partnership interest in New TMM (each, a “New TMM Unit”). The Principal Equityholders (through holding vehicles) hold New TMM Units and
one corresponding share of Class B Common Stock for each New TMM Unit they hold. As a result, the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock percentages were as follows for the dates presented:

Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Regulatory
We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as open space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has been to increase our overall costs, and may delay the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local 
10

governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.
TMHF is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans. Certain requirements provided for by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") have not yet been finalized or fully implemented. The effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators.
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, Veterans Administration-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state.
Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.
Environmental
We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, “environmental laws”). For example, environmental laws may affect: how we manage stormwater runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocation, and other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage, or other losses. 
As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties. To date, environmental site assessments conducted at our properties have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity or results of operations, nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns.
We manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance from the corporate and regional legal departments.
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites. We have a health and safety audit system that includes comprehensive twice-yearly independent third-party inspections of selected sites covering all aspects of health and safety. Key areas of focus are on site conditions meeting exacting health and safety standards, and on subcontractor performance throughout our operating areas meeting or exceeding expectations. All of our team members must complete an assigned curriculum of online safety courses each year. These courses vary according to job responsibility. In addition, groups such as construction and field personnel are required to attend additional health and safety related training programs. 
Information Technology
11

We have a centralized information technology organization with its core team located at our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, augmented with field support technicians in key locations across the U.S. Our approach to information technology is to continuously simplify our information technology platform and consolidate and standardize applications. We believe a common application platform enables the sharing of ideas and rapid implementation of process improvements and best practices across the entire company. Our back-office operations use a fully integrated, industry recognized enterprise resource planning package. Marketing and field sales utilize a leading CRM solution that tracks leads and prospects from all sources and manages the customer communication process from lead creation through the buying process and beyond the post-warranty period. Field operations teams collaborate with our supply chain management to schedule and manage development and construction projects with a set of standard and widely used homebuilding industry solutions.
Intellectual Property
We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,800 full-time equivalent persons. Of these, approximately 1,600 were engaged in corporate and homebuilding operations, and the remaining approximately 200 were engaged in mortgage and title services. As of December 31, 2016, we were not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are supervised by our project managers and field superintendents who manage third party subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for some architectural, engineering, advertising and legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
