Item 1 – Business

OVERVIEW
DPL is a regional energy company incorporated in 1985 under the laws of Ohio. All of DPL’s stock is owned by an AES subsidiary.
DPL has three primary subsidiaries: AES Ohio, MVIC and Miami Valley Lighting. AES Ohio is a public utility providing electric transmission and distribution services in West Central Ohio. For additional information on the primary subsidiaries, see Note 1 – OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 – OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements. All of DPL's subsidiaries are wholly-owned. DPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. See Note 12 – BUSINESS SEGMENTS of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL’s reportable segment. AES Ohio also manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. 
MVIC is our captive insurance company that provides insurance services to AES Ohio and our other subsidiaries, and Miami Valley Lighting provides street and outdoor lighting services to customers in the Dayton region. DPL also has a wholly-owned business trust, DPL Capital Trust II, formed for the purpose of issuing trust capital securities to investors.
AES Ohio’s electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, AES Ohio applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs or overcollections of riders. AES Ohio also has a 4.9% interest in OVEC, an electric generating company. OVEC has two electric generating stations located in Cheshire, Ohio and Madison, Indiana with a combined generation capacity of 2,109 MW. AES Ohio’s share of this generation capacity is 103 MW. AES Ohio does not have any subsidiaries.
DPL, through its subsidiaries, once owned all or a percentage of various generation facilities, the last of which was sold in June 2020. For additional information on this event and DPL's other previously owned EGUs, see Note 14 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
DPL's employees are essential to delivering and maintaining reliable service to our customers. DPL and its subsidiaries employed 657 people (547 full-time) at December 31, 2022, all of whom were employed by AES Ohio. Approximately 58% of all DPL employees are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 31, 2023.
Safety
As part of AES, safety is one of our core values. Conducting safe operations at our facilities, so that each person can return home safely, is the cornerstone of our daily activities and decisions. Safety efforts are led globally by the AES Chief Operating Officer and supported by safety committees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety.
We work with the AES Safety Management System (“SMS”), a global safety standard that applies to all AES employees and employees of AES subsidiaries, as well as contractors working in AES facilities and construction projects. The SMS requires continuous safety performance monitoring, risk assessment and performance of periodic integrated environmental, health and safety audits. The SMS provides a consistent framework for all AES operational businesses and construction projects to set expectations for risk identification and reduction, measure performance and drive continuous improvements. The SMS standard is consistent with the OHSA 18001/ISO 45001 standard. Our safety performance is also measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury significant injury potential incidents. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.
Talent
We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We have a comprehensive approach to managing our talent and developing our leaders in order to ensure our people have the right skills for today and tomorrow whether that requires us to build new business models or leverage leading technologies.
We emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful by focusing on experience and exposure as well as formal programs including the AES ACE Academy for Talent Development and our Trainee Program.
We believe that our individual differences make us stronger. Our Global Diversity and Inclusion Program is led by the AES Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Governance and standards are guided by the AES Chief Human Resources Officer, with input from members of AES' Executive Leadership Team.
Compensation
Our compensation philosophy emphasizes pay-for-performance. Our incentive plans are designed to reward strong performance, with greater compensation paid when performance exceeds expectations and less compensation paid when performance falls below expectations. We invest significant time and resources to ensure our compensation programs are competitive and reward the performance of our people. Every year, our people who are not part of a collective bargaining agreement are eligible for an annual merit-based salary increase. In addition, individuals are eligible for a salary increase if they receive a significant promotion. For non-collectively bargained employees at certain levels in the organization we offer annual incentives (bonus) and long-term compensation to reinforce the alignment between employees and AES.
SERVICE COMPANY
The Service Company provides services including operations, accounting, legal, human resources, information technology and other corporate services on behalf of companies that are part of the U.S. SBU, including, among other companies, DPL and AES Ohio. The Service Company allocates the costs for these services based on cost drivers designed to result in fair and equitable allocations. This includes ensuring that the regulated utilities served, including AES Ohio, are not subsidizing costs incurred for the benefit of other businesses. See Note 11 – RELATED 
PARTY TRANSACTIONS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 10 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
SEASONALITY
The power delivery business is seasonal, and weather patterns have a material effect on energy demand. In the region we serve, demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating compared to other times of the year. AES Ohio's sales typically reflect the seasonal weather patterns but can also be impacted by service territory economic activity, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the number of retail customers we have, as well as energy efficiency programs. During 2019, the impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs and economic changes in customer demand were almost entirely eliminated by AES Ohio’s Decoupling Rider, which was in place from January 1, 2019 until December 18, 2019. AES Ohio has requested authority from the PUCO to create a regulatory asset for the ongoing revenues that would have been charged in the Decoupling Rider going back to December 18, 2019. A hearing on this request was held in May 2021 and is pending a decision by the PUCO. See Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
Storm activity can also have an adverse effect on our operating performance. Severe storms often damage transmission and distribution equipment, thereby causing power outages, which reduce revenues and increase repair costs. Partially mitigating this impact is AES Ohio’s ability to timely recover certain O&M repair costs related to severe storms.
REGULATION AND MARKET STRUCTURE
Retail rate regulation
AES Ohio's distribution service to all retail customers as well as the provisions of its SSO service are regulated by the PUCO. In addition, certain costs are considered to be non-bypassable and are therefore assessed to all AES Ohio retail customers, under the regulatory authority of the PUCO, regardless of the customer’s retail electric supplier. AES Ohio's transmission rates are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act.
Ohio law establishes the process for determining SSO and non-bypassable rates charged by public utilities. Regulation of retail rates encompasses the timing of applications, the effective date of rate changes, the cost basis upon which the rates are set and other service-related matters. Ohio law also established the Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, which has the authority to represent residential consumers in state and federal judicial and administrative rate proceedings.
Ohio legislation extends the jurisdiction of the PUCO to the records and accounts of certain public utility holding company systems, including DPL. The legislation extends the PUCO's supervisory powers to a holding company system's general condition and capitalization, among other matters, to the extent that such matters relate to the costs associated with the provision of public utility service. Based on existing PUCO and FERC authorization, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheets of both DPL and AES Ohio. See Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
Ohio Retail Rates
AES Ohio rates for transmission and distribution electric service currently remain the lowest among Ohio investor-owned utilities.
ESP 1 established AES Ohio's framework for providing retail service on a going-forward basis including rate structures, non-bypassable charges and other specific rate recovery true-up rider mechanisms. For more information regarding AES Ohio's ESP, see Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
On September 26, 2018, the PUCO issued the DRO establishing new base distribution rates for AES Ohio, which became effective October 1, 2018. The DRO approved, without modification, a stipulation and recommendation previously filed by AES Ohio, along with various intervening parties and the PUCO staff. The DRO established a revenue requirement of $248.0 million for AES Ohio's electric service base distribution rates. The DRO also provided for a return on equity of 9.999% and a cost of long-term debt of 4.8%.
On December 14, 2022, the PUCO issued an order on AES Ohio's previously filed distribution rate case. Among other matters, the order establishes a revenue increase of $75.6 million for AES Ohio’s base rates for electric distribution service, which is expected to go into effect when AES Ohio has a new electric security plan in place. AES Ohio filed ESP 4 in September 2022 and anticipates approval of ESP 4 in 2023. For more information, see Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
On October 23, 2020, AES Ohio entered into a Stipulation and Recommendation (settlement) with the staff of the PUCO and various customers, and organizations representing customers of AES Ohio and certain other parties with respect to, among other matters, AES Ohio's applications pending at the PUCO for (i) approval of AES Ohio's plan to modernize its distribution grid (the Smart Grid Plan), (ii) findings that AES Ohio passed the SEET for 2018 and 2019, and (iii) findings that AES Ohio's current ESP 1 satisfies the SEET and the more favorable in the aggregate (MFA) regulatory test. On June 16, 2021, the PUCO issued their opinion and order accepting the stipulation as filed. The OCC appealed the final PUCO Order to the Ohio Supreme Court on December 6, 2021. An oral argument regarding this appeal was held on February 7, 2023 and a Court order is expected by Q4 2023. For more information, see Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
Ohio law and the PUCO rules contain targets relating to renewable energy standards. AES Ohio is currently in full compliance with renewable energy standards. AES Ohio recovers the costs of its compliance with Ohio renewable energy standards through its Standard Offer Rate Tariff, which is reviewed and audited by the PUCO.
The costs associated with providing high voltage transmission service and wholesale electric sales and ancillary services are subject to FERC jurisdiction. AES Ohio implemented a formula-based rate for its transmission service, effective May 3, 2020. For more information, see Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 2 – REGULATORY MATTERS of Notes to AES Ohio's Financial Statements.
As a member of PJM, AES Ohio also receives revenues from the RTO related to AES Ohio’s transmission assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. Ohio law includes a provision that would allow Ohio electric utilities to seek and obtain a reconcilable rider to recover RTO-related costs and credits. AES Ohio continues to recover non-market-based transmission and ancillary costs through its non-bypassable Transmission Cost Recovery Rider.
Ohio Competition
Since January 2001, AES Ohio’s electric customers have been permitted to choose their retail electric generation supplier. The SSO generation supply is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. AES Ohio continues to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in its state-certified territory and the obligation to procure and provide electricity to SSO customers that do not choose an alternative supplier. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over AES Ohio’s delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services.
As part of Ohio’s electric deregulation law, all of the state’s investor-owned utilities were required to join an RTO. AES Ohio is a member of the PJM RTO. The role of the RTO is to administer a competitive wholesale market for electricity and ensure reliability of the transmission grid. PJM ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving more than 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region’s transmission grid, administers the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to various federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of regulated materials, including ash; the use and discharge of water used in generation boilers and for cooling purposes; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials, including GHGs, into the environment; climate change; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewing permits and other governmental authorizations from federal, state 
and local agencies. Violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, other sanctions, suspension or revocation of permits and/or facility shutdowns. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with such laws, regulations and permits.
Where no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could have unfavorable outcomes for us and could require us to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022.
We have taken steps to limit our exposure to environmental claims that could be raised with respect to our previously-owned and operated coal-fired generation units, but we cannot predict whether any such claims will be raised and, if they are, the extent to which they may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
From time to time, we are subject to enforcement actions for claims of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. DPL and AES Ohio cannot assure that they will be successful in defending against any claim of noncompliance. However, we do not believe any currently open environmental investigations will result in fines material to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for human exposure to hazardous substances or for other environmental damage. Our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A discussion of the legislative and regulatory initiatives most likely to affect us follows.
Environmental Matters Related to Air Quality
As a result of DPL’s sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer Stations in 2017, retirement and subsequent sale of its Stuart and Killen Stations in 2019, and the retirement and sale of our interest in Conesville in 2020, thereby completing the exit of our generation business, the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL:
•the CAA and the following regulations:
◦CSAPR and associated updates;
◦MATS and any associated regulatory or judicial processes;
◦NAAQS; and
◦Greenhouse gas regulations established under CAA Section 111(d) for EGUs.
Environmental Matters Related to Water Quality, Waste Disposal and Ash Ponds
As a result of DPL’s retirement and subsequent sale of its Stuart and Killen Stations, the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer Stations and the 2020 retirement of Conesville, followed by the sale of our interest in Conesville and our exiting of our generation business, the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL with respect to these generating stations (although certain other requirements related to water quality, waste disposal and ash ponds are discussed further below):
•water intake regulations, including those finalized by the EPA on May 19, 2014;
•revised technology-based regulations governing water discharges from steam electric generating facilities, finalized by the EPA on November 3, 2015 (and revised on October 13, 2020) and commonly referred to as the ELG rules; and
•Clean Water Act rules for selenium.
Notice of Potential Liability for Third Party Disposal Site
In December 2003, AES Ohio and other parties received notices that the EPA considered AES Ohio and other parties PRPs for the Tremont City Landfill site, located near Dayton, Ohio. On October 16, 2019, AES Ohio received another notice from the EPA claiming that AES Ohio is a PRP for the portion of the site known as the barrel fill. While a review by AES Ohio of its records indicates that it did not contribute hazardous materials to the site, AES Ohio is currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter. If AES Ohio were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of Waste Disposal
In 2002, AES Ohio and other parties received a special notice that the EPA considered AES Ohio to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at a third-party landfill known as the South Dayton Dump (“Landfill”). Several of the parties voluntarily accepted some of the responsibility for contamination at the Landfill and, in May 2010, three of those parties, Hobart Corporation, Kelsey-Hayes Company and NCR Corporation (“PRP Group”), filed a civil complaint in Ohio federal court (the “District Court”) against AES Ohio and numerous other defendants, alleging that the defendants contributed to the contamination at the landfill and were liable for contribution to the PRP group for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the site.
While AES Ohio was able to get the initial case dismissed, the PRP Group subsequently, in 2013, entered into an additional Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”) with the EPA relating to vapor intrusion and again filed suit against AES Ohio and other defendants. Plaintiffs also added an additional ASAOC they entered into in 2016 pertaining to the investigation and remediation of all hazardous substances present in the Landfill - potentially including undefined areas outside the original dump footprint - to the vapor intrusion trial proceeding. The 2013 vapor intrusion ASAOC settled in early 2020, but the 2016 ASAOC remains to be adjudicated after completion of the remedial investigation feasibility study. While AES Ohio is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, if AES Ohio were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Regulation of CCR
On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective ("CCR Rule"). The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. The 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIIN Act"), includes provisions to implement the CCR Rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. The EPA has indicated that they will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule, which is ongoing. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. With the sale of our coal-fired generating stations, we expect that the impact of these regulations would be limited to our interest in OVEC.
On August 28, 2020, the EPA published the CCR Part A Rule that, among other amendments, required certain CCR units to cease waste receipt and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The CCR Part A Rule also allowed for extensions of the April 11, 2021 deadline if EPA determines certain criteria are met. Facilities seeking such an extension were required to submit a demonstration to EPA by November 30, 2020. On January 11, 2022, EPA released its first in a series of proposed determinations regarding nine CCR Part A Rule demonstrations, including for OVEC’s Clifty Creek and four compliance-related letters notifying certain other facilities of their compliance obligations under the federal CCR regulations. The determinations and letters include interpretations regarding implementation of the CCR Rule. On April 8, 2022, petitions for review were filed challenging these EPA actions. The petitions are consolidated in Electric Energy, Inc. v. EPA. It is too early to determine the direct or indirect impact of these letters or any determinations that may be made.
The CCR Rule, current or proposed amendments to the CCR Rule, the results of groundwater monitoring data or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Clean Water Act - Regulation of Water Discharge
AES Ohio and other utilities at times have applied the Nationwide Permit 12 ("NWP 12") issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in completing transmission and distribution projects that may involve waters of the U.S. NWP 12 is the nationwide permit for Utility Line Activities, specifically those required for construction and maintenance, provided the activity does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the U.S. for each single and complete project.
On April 15, 2020, in a proceeding involving the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana (Montana District Court) vacated NWP 12 and enjoined its application. On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the district court order, allowing the use of NWP 12 for oil and gas pipeline projects except for Keystone XL. On January 13, 2021, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rulemaking for the reissuance and modification of NWPs, including NWP 12, relating exclusively to the construction of oil or natural 
gas pipelines and the new NWP 57 for construction of electric or telecommunication utility lines. It is too early to determine whether future outcomes or decisions related to this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
On April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui case related to whether a Clean Water Act permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source such as groundwater. The U.S. Supreme Court held that discharges to groundwater require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. A number of legal cases relevant to the determination of "functional equivalent" are ongoing in various jurisdictions. It is too early to determine whether the Supreme Court decision or the result of litigation related to "functional equivalent" may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("the agencies") published a rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S., known as the "Waters of the U.S." ("WOTUS") rule. This rule, which initially became effective in August 2015, could expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to CWA permitting. However, after repealing the 2015 WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019, the agencies, on April 21, 2020, issued the final “Navigable Waters Protection” ("NWP") rule which again revised the definition of waters of the U.S. On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and remanding the NWP Rule. This vacatur of the NWP Rule applies nationwide. As such, the agencies are interpreting waters of the U.S. consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime until further notice. On January 18, 2023, the Agencies published a final rule to define the scope of waters regulated under the Clean Water Act. The rule restores regulations defining WOTUS that were in place prior to 2015, with updates intended to be consistent with relevant Supreme Court decisions. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on a wetlands case (Sackett v. EPA) on the limited question of: “whether the Ninth Circuit set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are ‘waters of the United States’ under the Clean Water Act.” The Ninth Circuit employed Justice Kennedy’s “significant nexus” test from his concurring opinion in the 2006 Rapanos v. United States decision; the plurality opinion in Rapanos required a water body to have a “continuous surface connection” with a water of the United States in order to be considered a wetland covered by the CWA. In Sackett v. EPA, the Court may finally provide clarity on which of these two tests from the 2006 Rapanos decision controls. It is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to rules interpreting federal jurisdiction over waters over the U.S. might have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Endangered Species Act
On November 30, 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final rule reclassifying the northern long-eared bat ("NLEB") from threatened to endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The classification is effective March 31, 2023. The NLEB is found in all or portions of 37 U.S. states in the eastern and north central United States, including Ohio. This reclassification may result in the need to obtain a permit or take other measures if the Company conducts activities in the range of the NLEB. It is too early to determine whether this rule might have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
Although we have exited our generation business, our continuing operations face certain risks related to existing and potential international, federal, state, regional and local GHG legislation and regulations, including risks related to increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Except as noted in the discussion below, at this time, we cannot estimate the costs of compliance with existing, proposed or potential international, federal, state or regional GHG emissions reductions legislation or initiatives due in part to the fact that many of these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final laws or regulations, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. Any international, federal, state or regional legislation adopted in the U.S. that would require the reduction of GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
On the international level, on December 12, 2015, 195 nations, including the U.S., finalized the text of an international climate change accord in Paris, France (the “Paris Agreement”), which agreement was signed and officially entered into on April 22, 2016. The Paris Agreement calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets, make these emissions targets more stringent over time and be transparent about the GHG emissions reporting and the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. A long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre-industrial era. The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement became effective on November 4, 2020. However, 
on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed and submitted an instrument for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which became effective on February 19, 2021. In November 2022, the international community gathered in Egypt at the 27th Conference to the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (“COP27”), during which multiple announcements were made, including the establishment of a loss and damage fund to support vulnerable countries dealing with the effects of climate change and certain pledges in the area of climate finance.
