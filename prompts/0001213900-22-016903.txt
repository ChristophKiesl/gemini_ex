ITEM 1. BUSINESS 



In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Thrive Acquisition Corporation. 



We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on April 27, 2021, and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Initial Business Combination”).



While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to focus on businesses in the global consumer health and wellness industry. More specific examples in these sectors include, but are not limited to, branded food, beverage, and consumer products in the better-for-you or sustainability-focused market sectors and companies supporting the consumer shift towards health and wellness through innovative platforms or technologies. Our management team and Board of Directors have extensive knowledge and relationships within these markets, and we intend to capitalize on our ability to identify and acquire businesses that stand to benefit from our unique operational and strategic expertise.



On May 5, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, to Thrive Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). Between May 2021 and September 2021, our Sponsor transferred to the Company’s executive officers, independent directors, and special advisor an aggregate of 437,520 Founder Shares at a price of $0.004 per share. In September 2021, the Sponsor transferred 798,650 Founder Shares to GR Sleep LLC (an entity controlled by Peter Graham) at a price of $0.004 per share. Our Sponsor and Charles Urbain subsequently surrendered to the Company an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares for no additional consideration resulting in a decrease in the total number of Founder Shares outstanding to 4,312,500.



On October 25, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 17,250,000 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 2,250,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $172,500,000.

On October 25, 2021, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to the Sponsor Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the GR Sleep Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement and the Urbain Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate 9,150,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor, GR Sleep and Charles Urbain at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $9,150,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the public warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Warrants”), except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor, GR Sleep or Charles Urbain, or their permitted transferees (except for certain limited exceptions).



The closing of the Initial Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants generated total proceeds of $181,650,000. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate amount of $175,950,000 has been placed in the U.S. based trust account (the “Trust Account”) established in connection with the Initial Public Offering. Transaction costs amounted to $16,408,042, consisting of $3,450,000 of underwriting discounts and commissions, $6,037,500 of deferred underwriting fees, $585,328 of other offering costs, and $6,335,214 excess fair value of anchor investor shares. In addition, on October 25, 2021, $2,216,376 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering, which is available for the payment of offering costs and for working capital purposes.



As a result of the underwriter’s exercise in full of its over-allotment option, 562,500 of the Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.



On December 7, 2021, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants included in the Units commencing on December 8, 2021 on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols of “THAC” and “THAC.W,” respectively. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “THAC.U.”
