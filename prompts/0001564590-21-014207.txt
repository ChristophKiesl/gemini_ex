Our Company 
 Vantage Drilling International is an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high specification drilling units. Our principal business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews, primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells for our customers. Through our fleet of drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major, national and independent oil and gas companies, focused on international markets. Additionally, for drilling units owned by others, we provide construction supervision services for rigs that are under construction, preservation management services for rigs that are stacked and operations and marketing services for operating rigs.
Our Fleet  
 Jackups 
 A jackup rig is a mobile, self-elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support, at which point the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations. All of our premium jackup rigs were built at PPL Shipyard in Singapore. The design of our premium jackup rigs is the Baker Marine Pacific Class 375. These units are ultra-premium jackup rigs with independent legs capable of drilling in up to 375 feet of water, a cantilever drilling floor and a total drilling depth capacity of approximately 30,000 feet. 
Drillships 
 Drillships are self-propelled and suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity. While both of our drillships are dynamically positioned and designed for drilling in water depths of up to 12,000 feet, with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to 40,000 feet, the Platinum Explorer and Tungsten Explorer are currently equipped to drill in 10,000 feet of water. Each drillship’s hull design has a variable deck load in excess of 20,000 tons and measures approximately 781 feet long by 138 feet wide. Both of our drillships were built at Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea. 
 The following table sets forth certain information concerning our offshore drilling fleet as of March 11, 2021.

Recent Developments
 The Continued Global Spread of COVID-19 
 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency as COVID-19 continued to spread globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally and the risks posed to the international community. The continued global spread of COVID-19 has caused widespread illness and significant loss of life, leading governments across the world to impose severely stringent limitations on movement and human interaction. Such governmental responses to the pandemic have depressed economic activity worldwide, impacting all industries, but with a significant adverse effect on the oil and gas industry.  The response of governments throughout the world to address the spread of COVID-19, including, among other actions, the imposition of travel bans, quarantines and entry restrictions, has notably impacted our operations, particularly challenging the ability to transport personnel and equipment to and from 
 7


our rigs, and for our customers and their suppliers to be able to seamlessly manage and conduct their respective operations.  See “Note 1. Organization and Recent Events” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our drilling contracts.
The impact of these challenges in 2020 resulted in (i) lower revenue due to terminations of (or amendments to) certain of our drilling contracts and (ii) increased expenses due to higher labor and related costs.  We cannot at this time determine with certainty how long these challenges will persist as well as the long-term impact that such challenges may have on our operations on a go-forward basis; however, the Company has been actively managing and continues to actively manage the business in an attempt to mitigate the impact of these matters on the Company’s operations.  In order to decrease the Company’s overall operating expenses, the Company undertook significant headcount and salary reductions, both onshore and offshore, as well as other cost reduction measures to reflect the lower operating activity.  For more information regarding the impact of these challenges on the status of certain of our contracts, please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 6, 2020, as further supplemented by our Current Reports on Form 8-K, which were filed with the SEC on May 12, 2020, June 2, 2020 and July 1, 2020, respectively.  
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, and the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance beyond 2020 will depend in large part on future developments, which cannot be predicted with confidence at this time.  Such developments include, but are not limited to, the duration and further spread of COVID-19, including the discovery of any new strains of COVID-19, the development, availability and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, and the general resuming of widespread economic activity. Therefore, we can give no assurances that the spread of COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in 2021 and beyond.
 Declines in the Demand for Oil and Gas, and the Resulting Oil Price and Market Share Volatility
 The collapse in global economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 caused demand for global oil and gas to significantly decline.  Moreover, members of OPEC and Russia failed to reach an agreement in March 2020 to extend previously agreed upon oil production cuts and make much needed additional oil production cuts. Thereafter, Saudi Arabia announced an immediate significant reduction in its oil export prices and Russia announced that all agreed oil production cuts between Russia and OPEC members would expire on April 1, 2020. The termination of the previous cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia had an immediate impact given that it had supported global oil prices in the past.  Saudi Arabia’s subsequent decision to dramatically increase its oil production and engage in a price war with Russia led to a massive oversupply of oil, which resulted in the overwhelming of global oil storage capacities.  
 This price and market share war was later reversed with OPEC, Russia and many of the world’s major oil producers reaching a record production cut agreement on April 12, 2020 and extending such agreement on June 6, 2020. However, the confluence of the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting global oil surplus significantly and adversely impacted the oil and gas industry beginning in the second quarter of 2020, causing (i) an unprecedented drop in oil prices, with Brent crude reaching $19.33 per barrel, its lowest price since 1999, and (ii) ensuing reductions of exploration and production company capital and operating budgets.  Though OPEC, Russia and other major oil and gas producing nations agreed to either cut or maintain levels of oil production as was the case in March 2021, the efforts to contain COVID-19 could continue to depress global economic activity in the near-term, and the supply and demand imbalance of oil and gas will likely continue for the foreseeable future.  Notwithstanding the recent recovery in global oil prices since (i) the development and availability of vaccines for COVID-19, (ii) the perception of the reopening of global economies along with (iii) the injection of substantial government monetary and fiscal stimulus, volatility of and uncertainty around global oil prices persist.
 It was this volatility and uncertainty in global oil and gas prices that caused oil and gas producers to cancel or delay drilling tenders in 2020, which negatively impacted our reported backlog and could potentially and negatively impact our future backlog.  Further, material payment delays, modifications or cancellations on our underlying contracts (including, but not limited to, delays, modifications or cancellations directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19) reduced the amount of backlog previously reported (and could further reduce the amount of backlog currently reported) and consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues.
 The potential for oil prices to decline in the future continues to put pressure on oil and gas activity levels, particularly in the deepwater segment. Oil and gas prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, changes in oil and gas inventories and industry demand, and therefore, the Company cannot predict how long oil and gas prices remain stable or further improve, if at all, or whether they could reverse course and decline. While our management is actively monitoring the foregoing events and its associated financial impact on us, it is uncertain at this time as to the full magnitude that volatile and uncertain oil and gas prices will have on our financial condition and future results of operations.  
 The Company has been, and remains focused on mitigating the impact of the foregoing events on its business.  In the second quarter of 2020, we commenced a plan to reduce our costs and preserve our cash.  For example, we (i) reduced the annual compensation payable to our independent members of the Board of Directors by 20% as well as the salaries of our workforce by approximately 15 to 20% depending on the position, and subsequently replaced it with a longer-term 10% reduction to annual compensation payable to our independent members of the Board of Directors as well as the salary of our workforce across the Company beginning on July 1, 2020, (ii) secured material price reductions from certain of our vendors and (iii) initiated significant 
 8


reductions in both our onshore and offshore personnel in June 2020 to reflect the lower levels of operating activity.  We continue to actively seek measures to reduce our operating costs and preserve our cash during these unprecedented times.  See our Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC on July 1, 2020, for further information regarding reductions in the salaries of our executive officers in an attempt to reduce the Company’s operating and corporate costs in light of the global economic challenges and the public health crisis resulting from the spread of COVID-19.
 Platinum Explorer Contract Award
 On February 3, 2021, VDI received a letter of award from Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) for a two-year contract with the Platinum Explorer.  The Platinum Explorer is currently performing under an existing three-year contract with ONGC, which is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2021.  The new contract with ONGC is expected to begin once the existing campaign concludes.  Expected revenues over the new two-year contract term, exclusive of service tax, are approximately $109 million. 
Operations and Management Agreement with Seadrill Partners
 On February 9, 2021, Vantage Holdings International (“VHI”), a subsidiary of VDI, entered into a Framework Agreement with Seadrill Partners LLC (“Seadrill Partners”) pursuant to which certain subsidiaries of VHI (the “VHI Entities”) entered into and will enter into additional, management and marketing agreements (the “Management and Marketing Agreements”) with certain subsidiaries of Seadrill Partners (the “Seadrill Entities”).  Under the Management and Marketing Agreements, the VHI Entities will provide marketing and operations management services in respect of certain deepwater floaters owned by the Seadrill Entities.  These Management and Marketing Agreements are subject to the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.
 Drilling Contract Arbitration.
On February 22, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Petrobras Parties’ petition for certiorari in their efforts to seek the reversal of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s decision to affirm the U.S. District Court – Texas’s judgment confirming the Petrobras Award.   This denial by the U.S. Supreme Court ended the drilling contract arbitration with the Petrobras Parties and all related appeals. See “Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details on the Drilling Contract Arbitration.
 Purchase and Sale Agreement to Sell the Titanium Explorer
 On December 31, 2020, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Best Oasis Limited (the “Buyer”) to sell the Titanium Explorer (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”), subject to the closing conditions contained in such agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $13.8 million and we subsequently classified the rig as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The transaction contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement closed on March 10, 2021.  Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Buyer is required to recycle the rig in an environmentally sound manner.  
Impairment of the Titanium Explorer’s Carrying Value
 During the third quarter of 2020, we evaluated our deepwater drilling rigs that had indicators of impairment and determined that the carrying value of our longer-term warm stacked drillship, the Titanium Explorer, was impaired. As a result, we recognized a non-cash loss on impairment of $128.9 million as of September 30, 2020. See “Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding the impairment of the Titanium Explorer. 
 Restructuring Agreement and the Associated Settlement Agreement
 The Company entered into a settlement agreement with VDC on March 4, 2020 to release each other from claims pertaining to certain intercompany receivables and payables as between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and VDC and its subsidiaries, on the other.  See “Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details on the Restructuring Agreement and the associated settlement agreement. Strengths 
 We believe our primary competitive strengths include the following: 
 We own and operate a diversified, premium fleet. We have a diversified fleet of seven high-specification drilling units that is capable of providing premium drilling services for both shallow water and deepwater applications. We recognize that shallow water and deepwater business cycles may differ, particularly during an industry recovery, and believe our fleet diversity reduces our reliance on any particular market segment. Our fleet currently includes five jackup rigs and two drillships. 

• | Jackup rigs. We believe that our ultra-premium jackup rigs compare favorably to the majority of the current global jackup rig fleet, which is primarily comprised of rigs that are older, smaller and less capable due to their reliance on, and utilization of, less modern equipment. Each of our jackup rigs is aged 14 years old or less and has a water depth capability of 375 feet and drilling depth capability of 30,000 feet. Our jackup rigs are equipped with offline stand-building systems, which provide significant

drilling efficiency and have at least a 1.4 million pound hook load, allowing more demanding wells to be drilled. Each of our jackup rigs have (i) a cantilever reach envelop of 75 x 30 feet, which enables each rig to reach more well slots on a platform without requiring a rig move, (ii) a large deck space, (iii) up to 3,749 tons of variable deck-load, allowing more equipment and supplies to be stored on the rig, and (iv) a 120-person accommodation, all of which we believe bring efficiencies, better logistics and significant cost savings to our customers. As a result, we believe our jackups are generally preferred by clients for their superior and more efficient drilling performance, better and more cost-effective logistics, and consistent activity levels. As demonstrated since 2015, clients have shown a preference for modern jackups, such as ours, with global modern jackup utilization rebounding more rapidly than older rigs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drillships. Both of our ultra-deepwater drillships are designed to drill in up to 12,000 feet of water, and one of our drillships has been further upgraded with a hook load of 2.5 million pounds, which further enhances its ability to drill deep, complex and demanding wells. Our drillships are currently equipped with risers to drill in water depths of up to 10,000 feet, which we believe is the optimal specification for the majority of current ultra-deepwater development projects. However, additional risers could be added to drill in water depths of up to 12,000 feet as needed by our clients. Finally, an MPD system has been installed on the Tungsten Explorer drillship, and we have the ability to equip this MPD on our other drillship. Based on our experience, a significant number of the recent and active requirements for floaters are requesting an MPD system (or a subset of an MPD system called Riser Gas Handling). We believe these high-specification and upgraded drillships are generally preferred by our clients and will better position us to secure contracts and command premium dayrates as compared to our competitors with less advanced fleets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our focus on increased efficiency has led to an optimized cost structure. Following the commodity price downturn in 2014, we implemented company-wide cost savings initiatives in an effort to reduce our rig operating expenses and general and administrative expenses through the right-sizing of shore-based teams and centralization of shore-based operational support in Dubai near key areas of operation. Further, we have significantly reduced our rig operating cost through nationalization and regionalization of senior offshore positions and active supply chain management. Additionally, as a result of the prolonged low price environment in 2020 caused by the spread of COVID-19, the resulting decline in global economic activity during the same period and the associated oil price and market share volatility, we began, and continue, to actively seek measures to reduce our operating costs and preserve cash during these challenging times. We believe our optimized cost structure is among the best in the industry and provides us with the flexibility to operate across business cycles and will lead to enhanced profitability in the event of a recovery in the offshore drilling industry. 
 
We are a leading operator with strong client relationships. We believe that our safety and operational performance, experienced and skilled employees, and modern and highly advanced fleet have produced a track record of high-quality client service and operational safety, efficiency and effectiveness. We have received special recognition from several of our clients for superior drilling services based on key operational metrics, including with respect to safe operations, drilling efficiency, low non-productive time and best contractor performance. 
 We have a proven management team. Our executive team has a strong reputation for sound execution, customer focus and delivering strong financial performance. Our management team has extensive experience in the oilfield services and offshore drilling industries, as well as experience operating in key global offshore development locations, including the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia and India, with major international and national oil companies as well as independent exploration and production companies. In addition to the members of the management team, we have highly trained personnel operating and maintaining our rigs. We believe that our team’s significant experience, technical expertise and strong client relationships, as well as the functional depth throughout our organization, enhance our ability to deliver superior drilling services to our clients and effectively operate on a global basis. 
 Strategy 
 Our principal business objective is to be the preferred provider of premium offshore drilling rig services to the oil and gas industry. Our operating strategy is designed to enable us to provide high-quality, safe and cost-competitive services through the current business cycle, positioning us to benefit from an expected increase in demand for offshore drilling and to increase our cash flow and profits. Specifically, we expect to achieve our business objectives through the following strategies: 
 Enhanced focus on safety and operational excellence. With cyclical demand for offshore drilling services, excelling in safety and operational ability is a key factor for success. We intend to continue our focus on minimizing safety incidents, while also continually increasing our operational uptime and efficiency. This dual focus is intended to enable us to develop and maintain long-term customer relationships and maximize the utilization of our fleet while also ensuring the safety of our and our customers’ employees and contractors. We intend to maintain our exemplary safety and operational performance through attentive and engaged leadership, ongoing competency and training programs, appropriate incentive structures at all levels and effective management oversight.

Efficiently manage costs to adapt to and withstand a range of market conditions. With a cost-competitive fleet, we believe we are well-positioned to operate across business cycles and achieve enhanced profitability in the event of a recovery in the offshore drilling industry. We have assembled and deployed an active fleet that we believe is at the low end of the cost-of-supply curve through right sizing and centralization of shore-based support, nationalization and regionalization of senior offshore positions, and active supply chain management. We believe these efforts to manage costs will enable us to maintain our industry-leading fleet utilization while generating positive operational cash flows in a cyclical dayrate environment. 
 Maintain high fleet utilization and consistent activity levels to capitalize on customer preferences for active rigs. We enjoy an industry-leading fleet utilization, which serves as a competitive advantage in securing contracts given operators’ strong preference for rigs with consistent activity levels. Consistent activity helps reduce the uncertainty of any associated costs and preparation time for rigs to undertake new contracts. All of our jackup rigs are currently contracted, preparing for contract or being actively marketed with contract commencements expected in 2021. One of our drillships is currently contracted and one drillship is maintained warm-stacked, scheduled to recommence operations in 2021. 
 Preserve balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity through business cycles. With approximately $154.5 million cash on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (including $12.5 million of restricted cash) and no near-term debt maturities, we continue to focus on preservation of liquidity as the offshore drilling business cycle continues. 
 Maintain high-quality asset portfolio with diverse footprint by selectively pursuing acquisitions that we believe align with our operational model and are likely to increase cash flow. Our balanced fleet of jackup rigs and drillships allows us to address the dynamic opportunity set in the offshore drilling industry. We believe the quality of our jackup rig and drillship fleets, combined with our experience in shallow and deepwater markets, position us to compete in various market segments and geographies. We maintain a young fleet with an average age of approximately twelve years; accordingly, our high-specification assets enable us to capitalize on the bifurcation in utilization levels between modern and older rigs, and to secure contracts with premium dayrates. Additionally, high-specification modern drilling units generally provide superior and more efficient drilling performance, as well as enhanced and more cost effective logistics. Newer and more modern drilling units are also generally preferred by crews, which makes it easier to hire and retain high-quality operating personnel. As a result, our fleet is well suited to meet the requirements of customers for efficiently drilling complex wells in demanding locations. To maintain our high-quality asset portfolio, we are focused on disciplined investment in, and the growth of, our active drilling fleet to maximize our profitability. Additionally, we have invested in MPD technology for the Tungsten Explorer ultra-deepwater drillship, technology which is currently required by a significant number of the tenders in the market and is becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, making such drillship highly regarded and sought after by customers. We have the ability to equip this MPD system on our other drillship.
 Our Industry 
 The offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling, workover and well construction services to oil and gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling units. Offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another. The cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions. However, significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long-term because of rig mobility. 
 The offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water (<400 ft.), midwater (>400 ft.), deepwater (>4,000 ft.) and ultra-deepwater (>7,500 ft.). The global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups. 
 Our jackup fleet is focused on the “long-legged” (>350 ft.) high specification market. The drillships that we operate are focused primarily on the ultra-deepwater segment, but can also operate efficiently and cost effectively in the midwater and deepwater markets. 
 Historically, the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand, limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in our industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time as is the case today. As is common throughout the oilfield services industry, offshore drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and gas. 
 Since 2015, in response to both market conditions and excessive levels of idle capacity in recent years, there has been intense downward pressure on operating dayrates as most drilling contractors had preferred to maintain rigs in an active state and customers had generally favored operating rigs over reactivated cold-stacked rigs. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, this downward pressure on pricing was starting to reverse itself as evidenced by opportunities for our services increasing in 2019 and early 2020 and dayrates were showing signs of general improvement. However, beginning in the second quarter of 2020, with the initial arrival, continued spread, and resulting impact of COVID-19, dayrates, rig activity and contract opportunities each declined significantly. 
 In response to the oversupply of drilling rigs, a number of our competitors began removing older, less efficient rigs from their fleets by either cold stacking the drilling rigs or taking them permanently out of service.  This trend has accelerated since the second 
 11


quarter of 2020.  In addition to the expected increase in scrapping (“recycling”), many offshore drillers, including our competitors, with significant levels of debt on their balance sheets have recently completed, are currently pursuing, or may elect to pursue in the near-term, debt restructurings. (see “Risk Factors—We may not be able to compete effectively against the actions taken by our competitors, which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and financial results” in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report). These debt restructurings may result in lower cost structures, and additional pressure and incentive to recycle rigs. As drillers emerge from these debt restructurings, consolidation could potentially occur thereby reducing the number of industry participants and potentially increasing the market share of certain of our competitors.  A combination of recycling, restructuring and consolidation will be necessary for the industry to regain firmer footing. Any industry recovery will also depend significantly on improvements to global macroeconomic conditions, including, but not limited to, the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 (see “Risk Factors—The continued global spread of COVID-19, fears relating to the spread of COVID-19, and associated oil market developments could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations” and “—The ultimate impact and effects of the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting pandemic are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time” in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report).  For further information pertaining to our business and trends in our industry, see “Business Outlook” under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

Drilling Contracts 
 Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiation with our customers, and most contracts are awarded through competitive bidding against other contractors. Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control. Currently all of our drilling contracts are on a dayrate basis. A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well (or group of wells) or covering a stated term. Certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination fee. Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of extensive downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events or for convenience by the customer. Many of these events are beyond our control. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the client exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term. Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the client to extend the contract to finish drilling a well-in-progress. During periods of depressed market conditions, our clients may seek to renegotiate drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts. Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension. To the extent (i) our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, (ii) our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or (iii) a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Contract Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2020, our owned fleet had total drilling contract backlog of approximately $94.5 million. We expect that approximately $63.9 million of our total contract backlog as of December 31, 2020 will be performed during 2021, with the remainder performed in subsequent years. 
Competition 
 The contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors, including the current and expected prices of oil and gas and the expenditures of oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and gas. In addition, demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control, including worldwide demand for oil and gas, the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non-OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves. 
 Drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis. Pricing (day rate) is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Rig availability, capabilities, age and each contractor’s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination. Operators also may consider crew experience, rig location and efficiency. We believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do, which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization, compete more effectively in a low price environment, build new rigs or acquire existing rigs. 
 Our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller, locally owned companies. Competition for rigs is usually on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that is sometimes substantial, from one region to another in response to demand. 
 Operating Hazards 
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the offshore drilling business, including, but not limited to: blowouts, craterings, fires, explosions, equipment failures, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. 
 These hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, suspension of drilling operations, or damage to the environment, including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas. Generally, we seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our customers for some of these risks. To the extent not transferred to customers by contract, we seek protection against some of these risks through insurance, including property casualty insurance on our rigs and drilling equipment, protection and indemnity, commercial general liability, which has coverage extension for underground resources and equipment coverage, commercial contract indemnity and commercial umbrella insurance. 
 There are risks that are outside of our control. Nonetheless, we believe that we are adequately insured for liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters, extensive fire damage or damage to the environment. For more information regarding the risks related to our insurance policies, see “Risk Factors—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. 
 Insurance 
 We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage, third party liability, employer’s liability, war risk, general liability, vessel pollution and other coverage. However, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.

Our primary marine package provides for hull and machinery coverage for our drilling units up to a scheduled value for each asset, which we believe approximates replacement cost. The maximum coverage for our eight drilling units, including the Titanium Explorer, which is classified as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, is $910 million. The policies are subject to certain exclusions, limitations, deductibles and other conditions. Deductibles for physical damage to our jackup rigs and our drillships are $2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, per occurrence. Our protection and indemnity policy provides liability coverage limits of $500.0 million per rig. In addition to these policies, we have separate policies providing coverage for onshore general liability, employer’s liability, auto liability and non-owned aircraft liability, with customary coverage, limits and deductibles. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 Our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to, and affected in varying degrees by, governmental laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws, regulations and duties relating to the importation and exportation of and operation of drilling units and other equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, environmental protection, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and gas companies and may continue to do so. Furthermore, these regulations have limited the opportunities for international drilling contractors to participate in tenders for contracts or to perform services in certain countries as the governments have strongly favored local service providers. Operations in less developed countries may be subject to legal systems that are not as predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. 
 The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.
 Governmental and Environmental Regulation 
 For a discussion of the effects of governmental and environmental regulation on our current operations, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages” and “—Public concern and legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the risks associated with climate change and the environmental and social impacts of fossil fuel extraction and use, and the growing emphasis by investors on investing in companies that are committed to environmental sustainability, could adversely affect our operations, the demand for oil and gas, our reputation and our access to capital and ability to refinance our debt” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. 
 Many aspects of our operations are affected by foreign, federal, state and local governmental laws, rules, regulations and policies that may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry, including those requiring us to control the discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Moreover, with the recent change in administration of the U.S. government, it is likely that new legislation, regulatory enforcement actions and executive orders, which are specifically aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil development activities in certain jurisdictions, will be proposed and adopted in the near-term (see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for further information).
 We have historically conducted work in the Gulf of Mexico and may conduct such work in the future. Although we are not currently conducting any operations under the jurisdiction of U.S. environmental and natural resource agencies, similar restrictions and concerns apply in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. These requirements and concerns may be more or less stringent than those associated with the following U.S. laws.
 Heightened environmental concerns have led to greater and more stringent environmental regulations, higher drilling costs, and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Requirements applicable to our operations include regulations that would require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or governmental approvals, control the discharge of materials into the environment, require removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent and may in 
 14


some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new or more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Environmental requirements include water quality laws, regulations and policies that prohibit and/or regulate the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum, into the waters. Certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to surface waters. Violations of monitoring, reporting, permitting and other requirements can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Laws governing air emissions and solid and hazardous waste also apply to our operations.
 A variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security have been adopted in certain jurisdictions where we operate. For example, these initiatives may require the development of vessel security plans and on-board installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications. 
 The International Maritime Organization (the “IMO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. Among the various international conventions negotiated by the IMO is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions. 
 Annex VI to MARPOL (“Annex IV”) sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. Annex VI also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling units, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. For this purpose, gross tonnage is based on the International Tonnage Certificate for the vessel. The United States has ratified Annex VI. In addition, any drilling units we operate internationally are subject to the requirements of Annex VI in those countries that have implemented its provisions. We believe the drilling units we currently offer for international projects comply with Annex VI, but changes to our equipment and ratifying countries’ regulatory interpretations of the Annex VI requirements could impose additional costs on us, which could be significant. 
 Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially adversely affected our earnings or competitive position. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental regulations to which we are subject. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to make expenditures to comply with governmental and environmental requirements. To date, we have not expended material amounts beyond those amounts spent on our basic rig designs in order to comply and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures.
