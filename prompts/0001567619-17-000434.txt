Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 Turning Point Brands, Inc. (the Company) is a leading independent provider of Other Tobacco Products (OTP) in the U.S. and the 7th largest competitor in terms of total OTP consumer units shipped to retail. In this discussion, unless the context requires otherwise, references to our Company we, our, or us refer to Turning Point Brands, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. References to TPB refer to Turning Point Brands, Inc. without any of its subsidiaries. We sell a wide range of products across the OTP spectrum, including moist snuff tobacco (MST), loose leaf chewing tobacco, premium cigarette papers, make-your-own (MYO) cigar wraps and cigar smoking tobacco, cigars, liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. We do not sell cigarettes. We estimate that the OTP industry generated approximately $10.5 billion in manufacturer revenue in 2016. In contrast to manufactured cigarettes, which have been experiencing declining sales for decades based on data published by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the OTP industry is demonstrating increased consumer appeal with low to mid-single digit consumer unit growth as reported by Management Science Associates, Inc. (MSAi), a third party analytics and information company. 
 Our portfolio of brands includes some of the most widely recognized names in the OTP industry, such as Zig-Zag®, Beech-Nut®, Stokers®, Trophy®, and VaporBeast™. We currently ship to approximately 900 direct wholesale customers with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S. that carry and sell our products. As of December 31, 2016, our products are available in over 170,000 U.S. retail locations which, with the addition of retail stores in Canada, brings our total North American retail presence to an estimated 200,000 points of distribution. Our sales team targets widespread distribution to all traditional retail channels, including convenience stores, where over 60% of all OTP volume is currently sold according to MSAi. 
 We operate under a lean, asset-light sourcing and marketing model, with a strategy that relies on outsourced product manufacturing and supply relationships and increased use of information technology and market analytics, which together allow us to maintain relatively low levels of capital expenditures compared to market participants with more significant manufacturing operations. For example, we have long-lasting relationships with some of the most well-known names in the industry, including a 19-year relationship with Bolloré, S.A. (Bolloré) – the trademark holder for Zig-Zag® – for the exclusive rights to purchase and sell Zig-Zag® cigarette paper and accessory products in the U.S. and Canada. We have partnered with Swedish Match NA, a subsidiary of Swedish Match AB (Swedish Match) for the manufacture of all of our loose leaf chewing tobacco products. We have a 3-year relationship with JJA Distributors LLC (JJA) for the sourcing of our cigars and cigarillos and an 8-year relationship with Durfort Holdings, S.A. (Durfort) for the sourcing of our MYO cigar wraps, each of which are marketed under the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand. We have a relationship with VMR Products, LLC (VMR) for the exclusive supply and distribution of VMRs V2Cigs® (V2®) brand of liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products to retail outlets throughout the U.S. 
 We operate in three segments: (i) smokeless products, (ii) smoking products and (iii) NewGen products. Information regarding net sales, operating income or loss, and assets attributable to each of our segments, is included within Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 We have successfully commercialized new products and leveraged the value of our existing brands into new OTP categories. For example:
 
• | In our smokeless products category, we leveraged our Stoker’s® brand legacy in oral tobacco (the #2 loose leaf chewing tobacco brand), to create our Stoker’s® moist snuff, which was introduced in 2009 using value-sized, 12 oz. tub packaging as opposed to the industry standard 1.2 oz. can. Through the fourth quarter of 2016, Stoker’s® had grown to be among the fastest growing moist snuff brands in the U.S., based on pounds sold, as reported by MSAi. In the third quarter of 2015 we began to introduce a traditional 1.2 oz. can of Stoker’s® moist snuff. This smaller packaging allows us to expand our presence from the approximately 25,000 retail stores that carry the large tub by targeting the greater than 135,000 convenience stores (which sell 75% of all MST volumes) for which our current large tub footprint is less commercially viable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our smoking products business, we leveraged the value of our Zig Zag® tobacco brand and entered the MYO Cigar Wraps segment. Within two years we captured a 50% share of the MYO cigar market
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  according to Nielsen Convenience and today have an 80% EQ unit share, as measured by MSAi. More recently, we introduced Rillo™ size MYO cigar wraps to match the size of cigarillo cigars, which are the most popular and fastest growing form of large cigars in terms of unit volumes.
 
• | In our NewGen products category, we introduced V2® e-cigarettes into a highly competitive market in 2013 that at the time had over 135 available brands. In just over two years, we established our V2® offering as a leading e-cigarette brand in the traditional retail space as measured by MSAi.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our May 2016 initial public offering (the IPO), we sold 6,210,000 shares of our voting common stock (including 810,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments) at a public offering price per share of $10.00. 
 We raised a total of approximately $62.1 million in gross proceeds from the IPO, or $58.2 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and other associated costs. We used the proceeds from the IPO, together with cash on hand to pay fees and expenses related to the IPO, repurchase outstanding warrants and options issued by our subsidiary, Intrepid Brands LLC (Intrepid), repay approximately $34 million of our floating rate PIK Toggle Notes due 2021 and to repay approximately $20 million in borrowings outstanding under our second lien credit facility.
 We have a portfolio of widely recognized brands with significant customer loyalty and an experienced management team that possesses long-standing industry relationships and a deep understanding of the OTP industry. However, we have historically been capital constrained by high leverage and as a result we believe our brands, management and our managements relationships are underutilized. We have identified additional opportunities to grow sales that we believe will be more readily achievable with reduced leverage following the IPO, including the launch of new products and expanding our distribution and salesforce. We also believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures across all product categories.
 Recent Acquisitions
 On November 18, 2016, we purchased five regional chewing tobacco brands from Wind River Tobacco Company (Wind River). The Wind River brands hold a 2% share of the chewing tobacco category, but command an 8% share in the stores where Wind River had secured distribution, demonstrating an opportunity to expand with our national salesforce. The purchase price was $2.5 million.
 On November 30, 2016, a subsidiary of the Company, purchased all of the capital stock of Smoke Free Technologies, Inc. d/b/a VaporBeast (VaporBeast) for an aggregate purchase price of $27 million. VaporBeast is a leading distributor of liquid vapor products servicing the non-traditional retail channel. We estimate the non-traditional retail channel sells greater than 50% of all liquid vapor products. The VaporBeast acquisition will (i) accelerate our entry into the non-traditional retailers; (ii) provide distribution of select current products; and (iii) establish a best-in-class distribution platform marrying VaporBeasts non-traditional selling skills with a national retail salesforce. 
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
 Large, Leading Brands with Significant Scale 
 We have built a portfolio of leading brands with significant scale that are well recognized by consumers, retailers and wholesalers. Our Zig-Zag®, Stokers®, and Beech-Nut® brands are each well established and date back 117 years, 77 years, and 120 years, respectively. In 2016, Zig-Zag®, Stokers®, and Beech-Nut® together generated approximately $197.4 million, or 87.1%, of our total gross sales. Specifically:
 
• | Zig-Zag® is the #1 cigarette paper brand in terms of retail dollar sales in the U.S. as measured by Nielsen Convenience, with significant distribution in Canada, and also the #1 MYO cigar wrap brand in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stoker’s® is the #2 loose leaf chewing tobacco brand and among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. We manufacture Stoker’s® MST using only 100% American Leaf utilizing a proprietary process to produce what we believe to be a superior product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beech-Nut® is the #3 premium brand in the loose leaf chewing tobacco segment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 2


  Zig-Zag® has strong, long-standing brand recognition. The Stokers® brand is seen as an innovator in both the loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff markets. The Beech-Nut® brand has a long and enduring name in premium loose leaf chewing tobacco.
 Successful Track Record of New Product Launches and Category Expansions 
 We have successfully launched new products and entered new product categories by leveraging the strength of our brands. We methodically target markets which we believe have significant growth potential. We have been successful in entering new product categories by both extending existing products and brands as well as by introducing new products. For example:

• | In 2009 we extended the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand into the MYO cigar market and captured a 50% market share within the first two years. We are now the market share leader for MYO cigar wraps, with an 80% share. We believe our success was driven by the Zig-Zag® tobacco branding, which we believe is widely understood by consumers to represent a favorable, customizable experience ideally suited to MYO products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We leveraged the proud legacy and value of the Stoker’s® brand to introduce a first-of-its-kind 12 oz. MST tub, which was not offered by any other market participant. Stoker’s® MST has been among the fastest growing moist snuff brands in the industry in terms of pounds sold. While competitors have introduced larger format tub packaging, Stoker’s® early entry and differentiated product have firmly established us as the market leader with over 50% of the Tub market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We strategically target product categories that we believe demonstrate significant growth potential and for which the value of our brands is likely to have a meaningful impact. As we continue to evaluate opportunities to extend our product lines or expand into new categories, we believe that our track record and existing portfolio of brands provide growth advantages.
 Extensive Distribution Network and Data Driven Sales Organization
 We have taken important steps to enhance our selling and distribution network and our consumer marketing capabilities, while keeping our capital expenditure requirements relatively low. We service our customer base with an experienced sales and marketing organization of approximately 140 professionals who possess in-depth knowledge of the tobacco industry. We have also adopted a data-driven culture supported by leading technology, which enables our salesforce to analyze changing trends and effectively identify evolving consumer preferences at the store level. In particular, we subscribe to a sales tracking system provided by MSAi that measures all OTP product shipments by all market participants on a weekly basis from approximately 1,000 wholesalers to over 250,000 retail stores in the U.S. This system enables us to understand volume and share trends across multiple categories at the individual store level, allowing us to target field salesforce coverage against the highest opportunity stores thereby enhancing the value of new store placements and sales activity. As the initial sales effort is critical to the success of a product launch, we believe that our experienced salesforce, expansive distribution network and our market analytics put us in a strong position to execute new product launches in response to evolving consumer and market preferences. 
Long-standing, Strong Relationships with an Established Set of Producers 
 As part of our asset-light operating model, we built long-standing and extensive relationships with leading, high-quality producers. In 2016, our four most important producers were: 
 
• | Bolloré, which provides us with exclusive access to the Zig-Zag® cigarette paper and accessories brand for the U.S. and Canada;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Swedish Match, which manufactures most of our loose leaf chewing tobacco;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Durfort, from which we source our MYO cigar wraps; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | JJA, from which we source our Zig-Zag® branded cigarillos
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 By outsourcing the production of products that represent approximately 83.5% of our gross sales to a select group of producers with whom we have strong relationships, we are able to maintain low overhead and minimal capital expenditures, which together drive our margins.

  Experienced Management Team
 With an average of 24 years of consumer products experience, including an average of 20 years in the tobacco industry, our senior management team has enabled us to grow and diversify our business while improving operational efficiency. Members of management have previous experience at other leading tobacco companies, including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris), Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company (now Liggett Group, a subsidiary of Vector Group ltd), Swedish Match, American Brands, Inc., and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a subsidiary of Altria). Notably, Lawrence Wexler, our President and CEO, brings over 20 years of experience from Altria Group, Inc., where he held various leadership positions within the finance, marketing, planning, manufacturing and sales departments. Given the professional experience of the senior management team, we are able to analyze risks and opportunities from a variety of experienced perspectives. Our senior leadership has embraced a collaborative culture, in which all of our combined experience, analytical rigor and creativity are leveraged to assess opportunities and deliver products that satisfy consumers demands.
Growth Strategies
 We are focused on building sustainable margin streams, expanding the availability of our products, new product development through innovation and improving overall operating efficiencies, with the goal of driving margins and cash flow. We adopted the following strategies to drive growth in our business and to enhance stockholder value:
Grow Share of Existing Product Lines, Domestically and Internationally
 We intend to remain a consumer centric organization with an innovative view and understanding of the OTP market. We believe that there are meaningful opportunities for growth within the traditional OTP market and expect to continue to identify unmet consumer needs and provide quality products that we believe will result in genuine consumer satisfaction and foster strengthening revenue streams. We maintain a robust product pipeline and plan to strategically introduce new products in attractive, growing OTP segments, both domestically and internationally. For example, in addition to our successful launch of Stokers® smaller 1.2 oz. MST cans, we believe there are opportunities for new products in the MST pouch, cigar and MYO cigar wrap markets. Products currently in our pipeline include Stokers® MST Pouches in the smokeless products segment; Zig-Zag® Natural Leaf Wraps and Zig-Zag® Unbleached/Hemp Paper in the smoking products segment; and Primal® Hemp Wraps/Cones, Premium e-liquids and Vape-not-Burn (VnB) Zig-Zag® in the NewGen products segment. We believe we have successfully built strong, powerful brands that have significant potential. In certain of our product categories, we have seen a positive correlation between the store call frequency by our salesforce and the increase of our retail market share. 
 In 2016, less than 5% of our revenues were generated outside of the U.S. Having established a strong infrastructure and negotiated relationships across multiple segments and products, we intend to pursue an international growth strategy to broaden sales and strengthen margins. We believe international sales represent a meaningful growth opportunity, and our goals include expanding our presence in the worldwide OTP industry on a targeted basis. For example, we have begun to sell our moist snuff tobacco products in South America, Zig-Zag® cigars in Canada, and have begun rolling out our Primal® brand internationally. To support our international expansion, we intend to pursue a dual path of introducing our own products and brands as well as partnering with other industry leaders to improve market access and profitability.
Expand into Adjacent Categories through Innovation and New Partnerships
 We continually evaluate opportunities to expand into adjacent product categories, by leveraging our portfolio or through new partnerships. In 2009, we leveraged the Zig-Zag® brand and introduced Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps with favorable results, and we now command the #1 market share position for that segment. We are currently expanding our Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps through the expansion of the Zig-Zag® ‘Rillo™ size cigar wraps, which are similar in size to machine made cigarillos, the most popular and rapidly growing cigar type. In addition, in 2015, we negotiated the worldwide exclusive distribution rights to an herbal sheet material that does not contain tobacco or nicotine, affording us the opportunity to sell on a global basis an assortment of products that meet new and emerging consumer preferences. These products are sold under our Primal® brand name and are a component of our NewGen Product segment. We intend to continue to identify new adjacent categories for which we are able to leverage our existing brands and partnerships.

  Continue to Grow a Strong NewGen Platform
 The OTP category is continually evolving as consumers actively seek out new products and product forms. Given this market demand, we have developed our NewGen Product platform, which we believe will serve new and evolving consumer demands across multiple product categories. Core products within our existing NewGen segment include: 
 
• | E-cigarette and vapor products, including liquids,
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Tobacco vaporizers, which heat rather than combust the smoking material (VnB), and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Herbal smoking products, which contain no tobacco or nicotine.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 Among these categories, we believe that the emerging liquid vapor segment may present the greatest growth opportunity as it allows each consumer to customize their experience by being able to choose both flavor and nicotine level. Although the liquid vapor segment is in its infancy, we believe that when properly commercialized, it may be highly disruptive to the traditional cigarette industry and emerge as a significant segment of the OTP market. We believe that a majority of current liquid vapor revenues are earned outside of the traditional retail environment through online sales or in non-traditional retail outlets. Our recent acquisition of VaporBeast accelerates our expansion in the non-traditional retail outlets for liquid vapor products.
 Outside of the tobacco space, we believe there are meaningful opportunities for herbal smoking products, like wraps and cones. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have obtained the exclusive rights to a proprietary and patented herbal sheet process that will enable us to meet consumer interest and achieve strong margins. These products are marketed and sold on a worldwide basis under our Primal™ brand.
 We believe that the categories within our NewGen segment are poised to be the key industry growth drivers in the future, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. We intend to continue to pursue growth of our NewGen product platform by offering unique and innovative products to address evolving consumer demands.
 Strategically Pursue Acquisitions
 We believe there are meaningful acquisition opportunities in the fragmented OTP space and with the successful completion of our IPO in May 2016, we are well-positioned to act as a consolidator. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities across the OTP landscape. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, our focus is on identifying acquisitions that strengthen our current product offerings or enable category expansion in high potential growth areas. 
 Substantially all of our 2016 U.S. gross margin was derived from sales of products that are currently regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (FDA). We have significant experience in complying with the FDA regulatory regime with a compliance infrastructure composed of legal and scientific professionals. We believe many smaller OTP manufacturers currently lack this infrastructure, which we believe is necessary to comply with the broad scope of FDA regulations. We believe our regulatory compliance infrastructure, combined with our skilled management and strong distribution platform, position us to act as a consolidator within the OTP industry. 
 We have a strong track record of enhancing our OTP business with strategic and accretive acquisitions. For example, our acquisition of the North American Zig-Zag® cigarette papers distribution rights in 1997 has made us the #1 cigarette paper brand in the U.S. in terms of retail dollar sales as measured by Nielsen. Perhaps more importantly, we own the Zig-Zag® tobacco trademark in the U.S. and have leveraged this asset effectively, with approximately 54% of our total 2016 Zig-Zag®-branded sales under our own Zig-Zag® marks, rather than those we license from Bolloré. In 2003, we acquired the Stokers® brand and have built the brand to a strong #2 position in the chewing tobacco industry while successfully leveraging the brands value through our MST expansion. More recently, and post IPO, we have completed two acquisitions. In November 2016, we purchased five chewing tobacco brands from Wind River and acquired all of the outstanding shares of VaporBeast, a leading distributor of liquid vapor products servicing the non-traditional retail channel. 
 We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they may arise, while exercising care and diligence designed to ensure that we only pursue opportunities that we believe afford operational or distribution synergies and are accretive.

  Maintain Lean, Low-Cost Operating Model
 We have a lean, asset-light manufacturing and sourcing model, with a strategy of maintaining low capital requirements, outsourced supplier relationships, and increased utilization of market and consumer analytics. We believe that our asset-light model allows us to achieve favorable margins and our market analytics allow us to efficiently and effectively address evolving consumer and market demands. In addition, our relationships allow us to increase the breadth of our product offerings and quickly enter new OTP markets as management is able to focus on brand building and innovation. We intend to continue to optimize our asset-light operating model as we grow in order to maintain a low cost of operations and healthy margins. In 2016, approximately $189 million of our gross sales, or 83.5%, were from outsourced production operations and our capital expenditures have ranged between $0.7 million and $3.2 million per year over the previous 5 years. Capital expenditures in 2016 were on the high end of the range as we purchased our previously leased Dresden Tennessee manufacturing facility for $1.3 million. We do not intend to outsource our MST production as a result of our proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of our competitors. 
Raw Materials, Product Supply and Inventory Management
 We source our products through a series of longstanding relationships that we value highly and that we rely on to allow us to continue conducting our business on an asset-light, distribution-focused basis.
 The components of inventories at December 31 were as follows (in thousands):
 
 | 2016 | 2015 
-------------------------------------------------+------+-------
Raw materials and work in process | $ | 2,596 | | $ | 1,940 | 
Leaf tobacco | | 27,391 | | | 20,839 | 
Finished goods - smokeless products | | 4,789 | | | 3,615 | 
Finished goods - smoking products | | 18,384 | | | 14,077 | 
Finished goods - electronic / vaporizer products | | 11,993 | | | 5,939 | 
Other | | 1,232 | | | 1,237 | 
 | | 66,385 | | | 47,647 | 
LIFO reserve | | (4,200 | ) | | (3,308 | )
 | $ | 62,185 | | $ | 44,339 | 

Smokeless Products 
 Our loose leaf chewing and moist snuff tobaccos are produced from air-cured and fire-cured leaf tobacco. We utilize recognized suppliers that generally maintain 12- to 24-month supplies of our various types of tobacco at their facilities. We do not believe that we are dependent on any single country or supplier source for tobacco. We generally maintain up to a two-month supply of finished loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff. This supply is maintained at our Louisville facility and in two regional public warehouses to facilitate distribution.
 We also utilize a variety of suppliers for the sourcing of additives used in our smokeless products and for the supply of our packaging materials, and we believe we are not dependent on a single supplier for these products. There are no current U.S. federal regulations that restrict tobacco flavor additives in smokeless products, and the additives that we use are food-grade, generally accepted ingredients.
 All of our loose leaf chewing tobacco production is facilitated through our agreement with Swedish Match. See —Distribution and Supply Agreements—Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement. All of our moist snuff products are manufactured at our facility in Dresden, Tennessee and packaged at our facilities in Dresden, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky.
 Smoking Products 
 Pursuant to our distribution agreements with Bolloré, which are discussed in more detail below under the heading —Distribution and Supply Agreements—Bolloré Distribution and License Agreements, we are required to purchase from Bolloré all cigarette papers, cigarette tubes and cigarette injecting machines that we sell, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these Distribution Agreements. If Bolloré is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operations in each case as set forth in the Distribution 


 6


  Agreements, we may seek third-party suppliers and continue the use of the Zig-Zag® trademark to market these products. To ensure that we have a steady supply of premium cigarette paper products as well as cigarette tubes and injectors, Bolloré is required to maintain, at its expense, a two-month supply of inventory in a bonded public warehouse in the U.S. 
 We obtain our MYO cigar wraps from the patent holder under our agreement with Durfort in the Dominican Republic. We obtain our Zig-Zag® branded cigar products under our agreement with JJA, which sources the cigars on our behalf from the Dominican Republic. 
 We obtain our MYO cigarette tobaccos, MYO cigar smoking tobaccos, and pipe tobaccos from domestic sources. We generally purchase these tobaccos through multiple sources, and we believe we are not dependent on a single supplier. We package these products at our Louisville, Kentucky facility. 
 NewGen Products
 We have developed sourcing relationships that are capable of producing liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products for other companies brands and for our own branded product line in the category, including our Zig-Zag® brand.
 Our recent acquisition of VaporBeast will (i) accelerate our entry into the non-traditional retail channel, where we believe the majority of liquid vapor products are sold; (ii) provide distribution of select current products; and (iii) establish a best-in-class distribution platform marrying VaporBeasts non-traditional selling skills with a national retail salesforce.
 Our herbal smoking products are obtained from a supplier, which owns the patented process for producing the sheet material. We have worldwide exclusive rights to the material. The production and packaging of our herbal smoking products is subject to an agreement with Durfort whereby they manufacture and package the finished goods in the Dominican Republic subject to our specifications and coordinate delivery with JJA to our designated distribution center in the U.S. We believe that our early entry into the herbal smoking products market has provided us with a meaningful opportunity to capture market share, and to increase this share as the market grows.
 Manufacturing
 We primarily outsource our manufacturing and production processes and focus on packaging, marketing and distribution. We currently manufacture approximately 15% of our products as measured by gross sales. Our in-house manufacturing operations are limited to (i) the processing and packaging of our MYO smoking products and pipe tobacco products, which is completed at our manufacturing facility in Louisville, Kentucky, (ii) the manufacturing of our moist snuff products, which occurs at our facility in Dresden, Tennessee and (iii) the packaging of our moist snuff products at our facilities in Dresden, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky. These MST products are processed in-house, rather than outsourced, as a result of our proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of our competitors.
Sales and Marketing
 We have grown the size and capacity of our salesforce and intend to continue strengthening the organization to advance our ability to deepen and broaden the retail availability of our products and brands.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a nationwide sales and marketing organization of approximately 140 professionals. Our sales and marketing group focuses on priority markets and sales channels and seeks to operate with a high level of efficiency. In 2016, our sales and marketing efforts enabled our products to reach an estimated 200,000 retail doors in North America, and over 900 direct wholesale customers with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S. 
 Our sales efforts are focused on wholesale distributors and retail merchants in the independent and chain convenience store, tobacco outlet, food store, mass merchandising and drug store channels. We have expanded and intend to continue to expand the sales of our products into previously underdeveloped geographic markets and retail channels. In 2016, we derived approximately 95% of our net sales from sales in the U.S., with the remainder primarily from sales in Canada.
 We subscribe to a sales tracking system from MSAi that measures all OTP product shipments (ours as well as those of our competitors) on a weekly basis from approximately 1,000 wholesalers to over 250,000 retail stores in 


 7


  the U.S. This system enables us to understand individual product volume and share trends across multiple categories down to the individual retail store level, allowing us to target field salesforce coverage to achieve the highest opportunity to access potential stores. In addition, the ability to select from a range of parameters and to achieve this level of granularity means that we can adapt to trends in the marketplace and constantly evolve our business planning to meet market opportunities.
 We employ marketing activities to grow awareness, trial and sales including selective trade advertising to expand wholesale availability, point-of-sale advertising and merchandising by the field salesforce and permanent and temporary displays to improve consumer visibility for our products. We comply with all regulations relating to the marketing of tobacco products, such as directing marketing efforts to adult consumers, and we are committed to full legal compliance in the sales and marketing of our products. To date, we have neither relied upon nor conducted any substantial advertising in the consumer media for our products.
 In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any customer that accounted for 10% or more of our gross sales. The Company had one customer that accounted for 10.9% of gross sales for 2014. In the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to our top three customers accounted for slightly over 20% of our gross sales. Our customers use an open purchase order system to buy our products and are not obligated to do so pursuant to ongoing contractual obligations. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral on trade receivables. Historically, we have not experienced material credit losses. 
 Competition
 Many of our competitors are better capitalized than we are and have greater financial and other resources. We believe our ability to effectively compete and our strong market positions in our principal product lines are due to our high brand recognition and the perceived quality of each of our products, and our sales, marketing and distribution efforts. We compete against big tobacco, including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris) and Reynolds American Inc., Swedish Match, Swisher International and manufacturers, including U.K. based Imperial Brands PLC, across our segments. Big tobacco has substantial resources and a customer base that has historically demonstrated loyalty to their brands. 
 Competition in the OTP market is based upon not only brand quality and positioning, but also on price, packaging, promotion and retail availability and visibility. Given the decreasing prevalence of cigarette consumption, the big tobacco companies continue to demonstrate an increased interest and participation in a number of OTP markets.
 Smokeless Products
 Our three principal competitors in the loose leaf chewing tobacco market are Swedish Match, the American Snuff Company, LLC (a unit of Reynolds American Inc.), and Swisher International Group Inc. We believe moist snuff products are used interchangeably with loose leaf products by many consumers. In the moist snuff category, we face the same competitors with the addition of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a division of Altria Group, Inc.). 
Smoking Products
 Our two major competitors for premium cigarette paper sales are Republic Tobacco, L.P. and Commonwealth Brands, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Imperial Brands PLC. Our two major competitors for MYO cigar wraps are New Image Global, Inc. and Blunt Wrap USA. In cigars, we compete in the non-tipped cigarillo market with Swisher International, Inc., Swedish Match and Good Times USA. 
 NewGen Products
 In the NewGen products segment, our competitors are varied as the market is relatively new and highly fragmented. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to our products and through the same channels through which we sell our liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through wholesalers and retailers, including but not limited to national chain stores, tobacco shops, gas stations and travel stores. Through our 2016 acquisition of VaporBeast, we now also compete directly with other non-traditional distributors including Vapor Shark.

 We are party to two long-term distribution and license agreements with Bolloré with respect to sales of cigarette papers, cigarette tubes and cigarette injector machines: one with respect to distribution in the U.S. and one with respect to distribution in Canada (collectively, the Distribution Agreements). Under the Distribution Agreements, Bolloré granted us the exclusive right to purchase the products bearing the Zig-Zag® brand name from Bolloré for resale in the U.S. and Canada. We have the sole right to determine the price and other terms upon which we may resell any products purchased from Bolloré, including the right to determine the ultimate distributors of such products within these countries. In addition, on March 19, 2013, we entered into an additional License and Distribution Agreement with Bolloré (the Bolloré License Agreement), which permits us the exclusive use of the Zig-Zag® brand name in the U.S. for electronic cigarettes and any related accessories, including vaporizers and e-liquids. The Bolloré License Agreement terminates upon termination of the Distribution Agreements. 
 Each of the Distribution Agreements were entered into on November 30, 1992 by a predecessor in interest for an initial twenty-year term, were automatically renewed in November 2012 for a second twenty year term and will automatically renew for successive twenty-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of such agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide that, in order to assure each of the parties receive commercially reasonable profits in light of inflationary trends and currency fluctuation factors, 120 days prior to December 31, 2004 and each fifth-year anniversary from such date thereafter, the parties are required to enter into good faith negotiations to agree on an index and currency adjustment formula to replace the index and formula currently in effect. If the parties are unable to agree, the dispute is to be submitted to binding arbitration. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, if at any time the price received by Bolloré fails to cover its costs, Bolloré may give us notice of this deficiency and the parties must promptly negotiate in good faith to adjust prices. If the parties cannot agree on new prices, we may purchase products from an alternative supplier reasonably acceptable to Bolloré until the next price adjustment period, subject to certain price-matching rights available to Bolloré and other terms and conditions. At the present time, we are operating under a temporary pricing structure and formula. The parties are considering a modified pricing formula and a potential new index and duration. See Risk Factors—We depend on a small number of key third-party suppliers and producers for our products. 
 Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, export duties, insurance and shipping costs are the responsibility of Bolloré and import duties and taxes in the U.S. and Canada are our responsibility. Under the Distribution Agreements, we must purchase cigarette papers, cigarette tubes and cigarette injector machines from Bolloré, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these agreements. Bolloré is required to provide us with the quantities of the products that we order consistent with specific order-to-delivery timelines detailed in the agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide us with certain safeguards to ensure that we will be able to secure a steady supply of product, including (i) granting us the right to seek third-party suppliers with continued use of the Zig-Zag® trademark if Bolloré is unable to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operation, in each case as set forth in the Distribution Agreements and (ii) maintaining a two-month supply of safety stock inventory of the premium papers, tubes and injector machines in the U.S. at Bollorés expense. 
 Under the Distribution Agreements, we have agreed that for a period of five years after the termination of the agreements we will not engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacturing, selling, distributing, marketing or otherwise promoting in the U.S. and Canada, of cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor without Bollorés consent, except for certain de minimis acquisitions of debt or equity securities of such a competitor and certain activities with respect to an alternative supplier used by us as permitted under the Distribution Agreements.
 Each of the Distribution Agreements permits Bolloré to terminate such agreement (i) if certain minimum purchases (which, in the case of both Distribution Agreements have been significantly exceeded in recent years) of cigarette paper booklets have not been made by us for resale in the jurisdiction covered by such agreement within a calendar year, (ii) if we assign such agreement without the consent of Bolloré, (iii) upon a change of control without the consent of Bolloré, (iv) upon certain acquisitions of our equity securities by one of our competitors or certain investments by our significant stockholders in one of our competitors, (v) upon certain material breaches, including our agreement not to promote, directly or indirectly, cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor or (vi) upon our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar event. Additionally, the Canada Distribution Agreement is terminable by either us or Bolloré upon the termination of the U.S. Distribution Agreement.

  Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement
 On September 4, 2008, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Swedish Match whereby Swedish Match became the exclusive manufacturer of our loose leaf chewing tobacco. Under the agreement, the production of our loose leaf chewing tobacco products was completely transitioned to Swedish Matchs plant located in Owensboro, Kentucky on September 18, 2009 and we ceased all loose leaf manufacturing. We source all of the tobacco that Swedish Match uses to manufacture our products along with certain proprietary flavorings and retain all marketing, design, formula and trademark rights over our loose leaf products. We also have the right to approve all product modifications, and are solely responsible for decisions related to package design and branding of the loose leaf tobacco produced for us. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities and inventory management with respect to our loose leaf products are allocated between us and Swedish Match as specified in the agreement. We also have rights to monitor production and quality control processes on an ongoing basis. 
 The agreement had an initial ten-year term and will automatically be renewed for five successive ten-year terms unless either party provides at least 180 days notice prior to a renewal term of its intent to terminate the agreement or unless otherwise terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. If a notice of non-renewal is delivered, the contract will expire two years after the date on which the agreement would have otherwise been renewed. The terms allow the agreement to be assumed by a buyer or it may be terminated for uncured material breach, or terminated by the Company subject to a buyout. We also hold a right of first refusal to acquire the manufacturing plant as well as Swedish Matchs chewing tobacco unit.
 JJA Distributors Service Agreement 
 On April 1, 2013 we entered into an agreement with JJA to source our Zig-Zag® branded cigars and cigarillos and other products from the Dominican Republic. Under the agreement, JJA and its Dominican Republic partner purchase and inventory all of the necessary raw materials, including packaging bearing our intellectual property, manufacture to our specifications and deliver to our designated U.S. distribution center. We retain all marketing, design and trademark rights over our cigar products.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
 We have numerous registered trademarks relating to our products, including: Beech-Nut®, Trophy®, Havana Blossom®, Durango®, Stokers®, Tequila Sunrise®, Freds Choice®, Old Hillside®, Our Pride®, Red Cap®, Tennessee Chew®, Big Mountain®, Springfield Standard®, Snake River® and VaporBeast™. The registered trademarks, which are significant to our business, expire periodically and are renewable for additional 10-year terms upon expiration. Flavor and blend formulae trade secrets relating to our tobacco products, which are key assets of our businesses, are maintained under strict secrecy. The Zig-Zag® trade name and trademark for premium cigarette papers and related products are owned by Bolloré and have been exclusively licensed to us in the U.S. and Canada. The Zig-Zag® trade name and trademark for e-cigarette and vaporizers are also owned by Bolloré and have been exclusively licensed to us in the U.S. We own the Zig-Zag® trademark with respect to its use in connection with products made with tobacco, including without limitation, cigarettes, cigars and MYO cigar wraps in the U.S. 
 Production and Quality Control 
 We use proprietary production processes and techniques, including strict quality controls. Our quality control group routinely tests the quality of the tobacco, flavorings, application of flavorings, premium cigarette papers, tubes and injectors, cigars, MYO cigar wraps, liquid vapor products, tobacco vaporizer products and packaging materials. We utilize sophisticated quality control to test and closely monitor the quality of our products. The high quality of our tobacco products is largely the result of using high-grade tobacco leaf and food-grade flavorings and an ongoing analysis of tobacco cut, flavorings and moisture content together with strict specifications for sourced products.
 Given the importance of contract manufacturing to our business, our quality control group ensures that established written procedures and standards are adhered to by each of our contract manufacturers. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, quality control and inventory management with respect to our loose leaf were allocated between us and Swedish Match under the manufacturing agreement. 
 Research and Development and Quality Assurance
 We have a research and development and quality assurance function that tests raw materials and finished products in order to maintain a high level of product quality and consistency. The research and development is also

  responsible for new product development across our segments, and largely base their efforts on our high-tech data systems. We spent approximately $1.8 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million dollars on research and development and quality control efforts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Employees
 As of March 6, 2017, we employed approximately 286 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by unions. We believe we have a positive relationship with our employees.
