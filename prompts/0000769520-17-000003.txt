The Customers and Market

Commercial Foodservice Equipment Industry

The company's end-user customers include: (i) fast food, fast casual and quick-service restaurants, (ii) full-service restaurants, including casual-theme restaurants, (iii) retail outlets, such as convenience stores, supermarkets and department stores and (iv) public and private institutions, such as hotels, resorts, schools, hospitals, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, stadiums, airports, corporate cafeterias, military facilities and government agencies. The company's domestic sales are primarily through independent dealers and distributors and are marketed by the company's sales personnel and network of independent manufacturers' representatives. Many of the dealers in the U.S. belong to buying groups that negotiate sales terms with the company. Certain large multi-national restaurant and hotel chain customers have purchasing organizations that manage product procurement for their systems. Included in these customers are several large multi-national restaurant chains, which account for a meaningful portion of the company's business, although no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.

Over the past several decades, the commercial foodservice equipment industry has enjoyed steady growth in the United States due to the development of new quick-service and casual-theme restaurant chain concepts, the expansion of foodservice into nontraditional locations such as convenience stores and store equipment modernization driven by efforts to improve efficiencies within foodservice operations. In the international markets, foodservice equipment manufacturers have been experiencing stronger growth than the U.S. market due to expanding international economies and increased opportunity for expansion by U.S. chains into developing regions.

The company believes that the worldwide commercial foodservice equipment market has sales in excess of $20.0 billion. The cooking and warming equipment segment of this market is estimated by management to exceed $1.5 billion in North America and $3.0 billion worldwide. The company believes that continuing growth in demand for foodservice equipment will result from the development of new restaurant concepts in the U.S. and the expansion of U.S. and foreign chains into international markets, the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment and new equipment requirements resulting from menu changes.

Food Processing Equipment Industry

The company's customers include a diversified base of leading food processors. Customers include several large international food processing companies, which account for a significant portion of the revenues of this business segment, although none of which is greater than 10% of net sales. A large portion of the company's revenues have been generated from producers of pre-cooked meat products such as hot dogs, dinner sausages, poultry, and lunchmeats and producers of baked goods such as muffins, cookies and bread; however, the company believes that it can leverage its expertise and product development capabilities in thermal processing to organically grow into new end markets.

Food processing has quickly become a highly competitive landscape dominated by a few large conglomerates that possess a variety of food brands. The consolidation of food processing plants associated with industry consolidation drives a need for more flexible and efficient equipment that is capable of processing large volumes in quicker cycle times. In recent years, food processors have had to conform to the demands of “big-box” retailers and the restaurant industry, including, most importantly, greater product consistency and exact package weights. Food processors are beginning to realize that their old equipment is no longer capable of efficiently producing adequate uniformity in the large product volumes required, and they are turning to equipment manufacturers that offer product consistency, innovative packaging designs and other solutions. To protect their own brands and reputations, retailers and large restaurant chains are also dictating food safety standards that are often more strict than government regulations.

3

A number of factors, including raw material prices, labor and health care costs, are driving food processors to focus on ways to improve their generally thin profitability margins. In order to increase the profitability and efficiency in processing plants, food processors pay increasingly more attention to the performance of their machinery and the flexibility in the functionality of the equipment. Food processors are continuously looking for ways to make their plants safer and reduce labor-intensive activities. Food processors have begun to recognize the value of new technology as an important vehicle to drive productivity and profitability in their plants. Due to customer requirements, food processors are expected to continue to demand new and innovative equipment that addresses food safety, food quality, automation and flexibility.
Improving living standards in developing countries is spurring increased worldwide demand for pre-cooked and convenience food products. As industrializing countries create more jobs, consumers in these countries will have the means to buy pre-cooked food products. In industrialized regions, such as Western Europe and the U.S., consumers are demanding more pre-cooked and convenience food products, such as deli tray variety packs, frozen food products and ready-to-eat varieties of ethnic foods.

The global food processing equipment industry is highly fragmented, large and growing. The company estimates demand for food processing equipment is approximately $5.0 billion in North America and $40.0 billion worldwide. The company’s product offerings compete in a subsegment of the total industry, and the relevant market size for its products is estimated by management to exceed $2.0 billion in North America and $4.0 billion worldwide.
Residential Kitchen Equipment Industry
The company’s end-user customers include the high-end residential kitchens. The premium segment of the residential kitchen equipment industry is estimated to be in excess of $1.0 billion annually in North America. This segment has grown over the past several decades after the original introduction premium cooking range. Viking was the first manufacturer to introduce the premium cooking equipment to the North American market, providing equipment that was comparable to commercial grade ranges and ovens for home chefs and culinarians. The market potential for such equipment has continued to broaden due to an increase in interest from the consumer to have high-end, luxury appliances in their home. Other important factors which affect the market size and growth include the level of new home starts, home remodels and general macro-economic factors. Macro-economic factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, inflation and consumer confidence, which impact the overall economy, impact the residential kitchen equipment industry and cause greater variability in the revenues at this segment than the other business segments the company operates in.
