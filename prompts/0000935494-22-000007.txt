The power of our open platform 
Across the world, software connections are driving our innovation. We have made significant investments in software interfaces so customers can integrate NI-based solutions into their existing architectures of preferred development tools (such as Python, Linux, C++, Mathworks, MATLAB & Simulink, Microsoft Visual Studio, .NET) and data analytics services. This flexibility allows for a seamless integration into legacy systems, while also leveraging previous work for a more complete final solution. Users can do more with our platform to develop automated, standardized, and efficient test and measurement applications and better connect the data output from those applications to a broader network of manufacturing data. This collective and open approach can deliver the right solution for customers at an effective cost of deployment. 
Over the past few years, we have demonstrated our commitment to the excellence of this software ecosystem by modernizing our flagship software, LabVIEW, while also expanding our platform by acquiring and integrating software capabilities in focus areas such as transportation, as highlighted by our 2021 acquisition of monoDrive, a provider of ultra-high fidelity simulation software for advanced driver-assistance systems ("ADAS"), and data analytics, as highlighted by our 2020 acquisition of OptimalPlus Ltd. ("OptimalPlus"), which provide customers with the needed capabilities to manage the increasing complexity and cost of their test and measurement operations. Focused on business critical actions and insights, our platform aims to support efficient use of operational assets and use advanced product manufacturing analytics to maximize product performance and overall business outcomes.
Modular Hardware 
We provide modular instrumentation that offers our customers the ability to create their own unique programmable, flexible and low-cost solutions. We believe our modular instrument approach enables us to grow our sales in the automated validation and automated production test market by delivering more test coverage and a lower-cost alternative for our customers. We offer two primary hardware form factors, PXI and NI C-series, both with a modular input/output ("I/O") approach in addition to industry standard PCI form factors. The NI PXI modular instrument platform, introduced in 1997, is a standard PC architecture in a rugged form factor with expansion slots and instrumentation extensions for timing, triggering and signal sharing. The NI PXI combines mainstream PC software and PCI hardware with advanced instrumentation capabilities. The NI C-series platform, used in our CompactRIO and CompactDAQ products, is a rugged, high-performance I/O and processing platform used in a wide variety of data acquisition applications. We believe our C-series data acquisition and control products provide unique value where diverse I/O is needed, and we believe that we can expand our user base through new distributed and rugged products. The NI PXI and C-series platforms include field programmable gate array ("FPGA") technology, providing customers programmable hardware capability that provides high performance and is user-customizable with NI LabVIEW software. 

Increasingly, our customers’ applications demand more system capabilities that more closely match their application needs. We have continually evolved our offering to include highly innovative products and application-specific systems. One example in the semiconductor industry is our NI Semiconductor Test System ("STS"), which combines NI modular instrumentation with NI software for radio frequency ("RF") and mixed-signal production testing. The STS features fully production-ready test systems that use NI technology in a form factor suitable for a semiconductor production test environment. The STS combines the NI PXI hardware, TestStand test management software, and LabVIEW graphical programming software inside a fully enclosed test head. The compact STS design houses all the key components of a production tester while using a fraction of the floor space, power, and maintenance typically required by traditional automated test equipment. With the open, modular design, engineers can take advantage of the latest industry standard PXI modules for more instrumentation and computing power. We are seeing a similar need for application specific systems in the Transportation industry. With the increase in both the volume and complexity of electrical components in vehicles, NI customers need to increase production test capacity while minimizing costs. The NI ECU Test System (ECUTS) reduces the cost of test by testing multiple engine control units (ECUs) in parallel in the same or similar footprint to traditional test systems. This system is defined by software and built on the NI modular hardware platform which increases flexibility for our customers and protects against rapid requirements changes in the future. In addition, electrification has become a major trend in the automotive industry and battery technology is a major contributor to electric vehicle capabilities such as range, performance, and charging time. Battery technology is also changing rapidly and requires long test cycle times during the development process. The NI Battery Test System (BTS) automates the process of testing battery performance during design validation by providing a system-level starting point for the most common battery cycle tests and is configurable for rapidly adjusting to unique testing requirements in order to accelerate the design process. Our acquisition of NH Research, LLC ("NHR") in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our expected acquisition of Heinzinger Automotive GmbH will also expand NI’s EV, battery, and sustainable energy portfolio, thereby providing customers with critical power-level test capabilities.

See further discussion regarding risks associated with our patents in Item 1A, Risk Factors, Our Business Depends on Our Proprietary Rights and We Have Been Subject to Intellectual Property Litigation. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We manufacture substantially all of our product at our facilities in Debrecen, Hungary and Penang, Malaysia. Our product manufacturing operations can be divided into three areas: electronic circuit card and module assembly; chassis and electronic cable assembly; and technical manuals and product support documentation. Most of our electronic circuit card assemblies, modules and chassis are manufactured in-house, although contractors are used from time to time. The majority of our electronic cable assemblies are produced by contractors; however, we do manufacture some on an exception basis. Our software, technical manuals and product support documentation are delivered digitally wherever possible. In those cases where physical media is required, we use outside partners to produce these materials.
Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources. Several of these components are only available through limited sources. Limited source items purchased include custom application specific integrated circuits, chassis and other items. We have in the past experienced delays, price increases and quality problems in connection with limited source items, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future. Accordingly, our failure to receive items from limited source item suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Our Business is Dependent on Key Suppliers and Distributors for additional discussion of the risks associated with limited source suppliers. We must comply with many different governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our operations in the U.S., Hungary, and Malaysia. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Our Operations are Subject to a Variety of Environmental Regulations and Costs for further discussion of environmental matters as they may affect our business.
Backlog
Backlog is a measure of firm orders that are received but have not yet shipped to customers. Our measure of backlog excludes amounts related to shipments where the customer has specified delivery in a future period. 
At December 31, 2021, our backlog was approximately $154 million compared to approximately $28 million at December 31, 2020, primarily driven by strong order growth during the year and longer lead times for certain components. We expect the majority of backlog to be recognized as revenue within 12 months. While backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Human Capital
At NI, we believe our company, our people and our products make a positive impact on society and the planet. We consider our employees to be one of our greatest assets and critical to our continued success. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 40% are in the Americas, 32% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region, and 28% in the Asia-Pacific ("APAC") region.
