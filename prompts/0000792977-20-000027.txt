ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
Overview
AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1981. We are a pharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative products to patients with unmet medical needs by leveraging our development and commercial expertise to invest in and grow our pharmaceutical products and product candidates across a range of therapeutic areas. Our currently marketed products support the health of patients in the areas of hematology and maternal and women’s health, including Feraheme® (ferumoxytol injection) for intravenous (“IV”) use, Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) auto-injector, Intrarosa® (prasterone) vaginal inserts and Vyleesi®(bremelanotide injection). In addition to our approved products, our portfolio includes two product candidates, AMAG-423 (digoxin immune fab (ovine)), which is being studied for the treatment of severe preeclampsia, and ciraparantag, which is being studied as an anticoagulant reversal agent. Our primary sources of revenue during 2019 were from sales of Feraheme, Makena, and Intrarosa. 
In January 2020, we announced that we had recently completed a review of our product portfolio and strategy with the objective of driving near- and long-term profitability and enhancing shareholder value. Based on this strategic review, we are currently pursuing options to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi. In addition, we also announced that William Heiden will be stepping down as our President and Chief Executive Officer. We expect that Mr. Heiden will remain at the company until the Board of Directors (the “Board”) appoints a new Chief Executive Officer. 
Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the trading symbol “AMAG.”

Feraheme
Overview
Feraheme received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in June 2009 for use as an IV iron replacement therapy for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD. In February 2018, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) to expand the label to include all eligible adult IDA patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron, in addition to patients who have CKD. With the expanded Feraheme label, we have seen and expect to continue to see increased utilization within hematology and oncology clinics and hospitals and may also see incremental usage with gastroenterologists. In 2019, sales of Feraheme accounted for approximately 51% of our total net revenues. 
The expanded Feraheme label was supported by two positive pivotal Phase 3 trials, which evaluated Feraheme versus iron sucrose or placebo in a broad population of patients with IDA and positive results from a third Phase 3 randomized, double-blind non-inferiority trial that evaluated the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension with Feraheme compared to Injectafer® (ferric carboxymaltose injection) (the “Feraheme comparator trial”). The Feraheme comparator trial demonstrated comparability to Injectafer® based on the primary composite endpoint of the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension (Feraheme incidence 0.6%; Injectafer® incidence 0.7%). Adverse event rates were similar across both treatment groups; however, the incidence of severe hypophosphatemia (defined by blood phosphorous of <0.2 mg/dl at week 2) was less in the patients receiving Feraheme (0.4% of patients) compared to those receiving Injectafer® (38.7% of patients).
Iron Deficiency Anemia
Currently, there are two common methods of iron therapy used to treat IDA: oral iron supplements and IV iron. Oral iron is the first-line iron replacement therapy for most physicians. However, oral iron supplements are poorly absorbed and not well tolerated by some patients, which may adversely impact their effectiveness, and are associated with certain side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea, and cramping, that may adversely affect patient compliance in using such products. In addition, it can take an extended time for hemoglobin levels to improve following the initiation of oral iron treatment, and even then the targeted hemoglobin levels may not be reached. Conversely, iron given intravenously allows larger amounts of iron to be delivered to patients in a shorter time frame while avoiding many of the side effects and treatment compliance issues associated with oral iron, and can result in faster rises in hemoglobin levels. We believe that IV iron is underutilized in IDA patients, and thus a significant opportunity remains to grow the market for IV iron in this patient population. 
IDA is prevalent in many different patient populations. For many of these patients, treatment with oral iron is unsatisfactory or is not tolerated. It is estimated that approximately five million people in the U.S. have IDA and we estimate that a small fraction of the patients who are diagnosed with IDA regardless of the underlying cause are currently being treated with IV iron. We estimate that the size of the total 2019 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.5 million grams, including patients with IDA due to CKD, chemotherapy-induced anemia and gastrointestinal diseases or disorders. 

• | Chronic Kidney Disease: CKD is a progressive condition that leads to chronic and permanent loss of kidney function. It contributes to the development of many complications, including anemia, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid/base abnormalities, bone disease and cardiovascular disease. Anemia, a common condition among CKD patients, is associated with cardiovascular complications, decreased quality of life, hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Anemia can develop early during the course of CKD and worsens with advancing kidney disease.


• | Cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia: IDA is also common in patients with cancer, and it is estimated that 32% to 60% of cancer patients have iron deficiency, most of whom are anemic. Iron supplementation through both oral and IV administration plays an important role in treating anemia in cancer patients. While there may be some differences in the underlying causes of anemia and iron deficiency in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy and those who are not, patients in both categories may develop IDA due to blood loss and/or the inadequate intake or absorption of iron. Oral iron has been used to treat IDA in cancer patients, but its efficacy is variable due to inconsistent bioavailability and absorption, a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, potential interactions with other treatments, and patient noncompliance. IV iron has been shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated in the cancer patient population in both patients who are receiving chemotherapy and those who are not.


• | Gastrointestinal Disease: It is estimated that among IDA patients referred to gastroenterologists, the rate of gastrointestinal pathology was found to be approximately 40% to 80%. IDA in patients with gastrointestinal diseases is likely caused by blood loss and/or the inadequate intake or absorption of iron. Oral iron has been used to treat IDA in patients with gastrointestinal diseases, but its efficacy is variable due to inconsistent bioavailability and absorption, the high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and patient noncompliance. IDA is especially an issue with patients who have inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis. These patients have recurrent and chronic anemia. Guidelines published by the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization emphasize the use of IV iron over oral iron unless the patient’s inflammatory bowel disease is stable and his or her anemia is mild.

Post-Approval Commitments for Feraheme 
As part of our post-approval Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme for the treatment of CKD, we had initiated a randomized, active-controlled pediatric study of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in pediatric CKD patients. During 2015, we suspended this trial due to difficulty in enrollment. Following discussions with the FDA, we amended the protocol and initiated a new pediatric study in 2018. Further, as part of our post-approval PREA requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA for the broader label, we have initiated a randomized, active-controlled pediatric study of Feraheme in pediatric patients with IDA. The final report submission for the IDA study is due to the FDA in November 2022. Both clinical studies are currently enrolling.
Makena
Overview
We acquired the rights to Makena in connection with our acquisition of Lumara Health Inc. (“Lumara Health”) in November 2014. Makena is indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. Makena is administered weekly by a healthcare professional with treatment beginning between 16 weeks and 20 weeks and six days of gestation and continuing until 36 weeks and six days of gestation or delivery, whichever happens first. The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea. We currently sell Makena primarily to wholesalers, specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors, which, in turn, sell Makena to healthcare providers, hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery networks. In 2019, sales of Makena, including the Makena authorized generic, accounted for approximately 37% of our total net revenues. 
Makena was approved by the FDA in February 2011 as an intramuscular (“IM”) injection (the “Makena IM product”) packaged in a multi-dose vial and in February 2016 as a single-dose preservative-free vial. In February 2018, the Makena auto-injector was approved by the FDA for administration via a pre-filled subcutaneous auto-injector, a drug-device combination product. In mid-2018, we launched our own authorized generic of both the single- and multi-dose vials (the “Makena authorized generic”) through Prasco, LLC (“Prasco”). As previously disclosed, based on manufacturing challenges and increased generic competition we no longer offer a branded IM presentation of Makena and in August 2019 we and Prasco determined it was not commercially viable to continue the relationship and mutually terminated our distribution and supply agreement, such that we no longer offer the Makena authorized generic. Further, as a result of the loss of substantial market share for the Makena IM product, in the second quarter of 2019 we revised our long-term Makena IM products forecast resulting in the recording of significant impairment charges related to the Makena IM products, as discussed in Note I, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
In March 2019, we announced topline results from the Progestin’s Role in Optimizing Neonatal Gestation clinical trial (“PROLONG” or “Trial 003”), a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating Makena in patients with a history of a prior spontaneous singleton preterm delivery. The PROLONG trial was conducted under the FDA’s “Subpart H” accelerated approval process. The approval of Makena was based primarily on the Meis trial (“Trial 002”), which was conducted by the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network, sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In contrast to the Meis trial, the PROLONG trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms for the co-primary endpoints: the incidence of preterm delivery at less than 35 weeks (Makena treated group 11.0% vs. placebo 11.5%) and the percentage of patients who met criteria for the pre-specified neonatal morbidity and mortality composite index (Makena treated group 5.6% vs. placebo 5.0%). The adverse event profile between the two arms was comparable. Adverse events of special interest, including miscarriage and stillbirth, were infrequent and similar between the treatment and placebo groups. The PROLONG trial enrolled 1,708 pregnant women, over 75% of whom were enrolled outside the U.S. 
On October 29, 2019, the Advisory Committee met to discuss the results of the PROLONG trial to inform the FDA’s regulatory decision for Makena. Following various presentations by experts and discussions at the meeting, the Advisory Committee voted as follows: (a) in response to the question “Do the findings from Trial 003 verify the clinical benefits of Makena on neonatal outcomes?”, 16 members voted “No” and no members voted “Yes”; (b) in response to the question “Based on the findings from Trial 002 and Trial 003, is there substantial evidence of effectiveness of Makena in reducing the risk of recurrent preterm birth?”, 13 members voted “No” and three members voted “Yes”; and (c) in response to the question, “Should the FDA (A) pursue withdrawal of approval for Makena, (B) leave Makena on the market under accelerated approval and require a new confirmatory trial, or (C) leave Makena on the market without requiring a new confirmatory trial?”, nine members voted for (A), seven members voted for (B) and no members voted for (C). The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its Advisory Committees, but will take them into consideration in deciding what regulatory steps to take with respect to Makena. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we reassessed the fair value of assets related to the Makena auto-injector following the Advisory Committee meeting and recorded $59.1 million in impairment charges, as discussed in Note I, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
This complex and unique situation has no clear precedent and it is therefore difficult to predict outcomes or timing of any FDA actions with respect to Makena. We remain committed to working collaboratively with the FDA to seek a path forward to ensure eligible pregnant women continue to have access to Makena and the currently approved generics that rely on Makena as the innovator drug.
Preterm Birth
Makena is a progestin whose active ingredient is hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”), which is a synthetic chemical structurally related to progesterone. Progestins, such as HPC, and progesterone belong to a class of drugs called progestogens. Progestogens have been studied to reduce preterm birth and have shown varying results depending upon the subjects enrolled. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (the “SMFM”) Publications Committee published clinical guidelines for the use of progestogens to reduce the risk of preterm birth in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in May 2012. SMFM reaffirmed their guidelines in January 2017, noting that vaginal progesterone should not be considered a substitute for HPC in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the “ACOG”) published clinical guidelines for the “Prediction and Prevention of Preterm Birth” in Practice Bulletin #130 in October 2012. Following publication of the PROLONG trial, the ACOG issued a Practice Advisory stating that it “continues to recommend offering hydroxyprogesterone caproate as outlined in Practice Bulletin #130,” explaining that consideration for treatment of “women at risk of recurrent preterm birth should continue to take into account the body of evidence for progesterone supplementation, the values and preferences of the pregnant woman, the resources available, and the setting in which the intervention will be implemented.” The SMFM also released an updated statement, in which they noted it is still “reasonable for providers to use [HPC] in women with a profile more representative of the very high-risk population reported in the Meis study.” Notably, the SMFM agreed that “substantial differences in the populations studied likely account for the different baseline rates of recurrent [preterm birth] and potentially explain some of the contrasting results observed in the Meis and PROLONG studies.”
Preterm birth is defined as a birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), preterm birth affected nearly 400,000 babies born in the U.S. in 2018, or one of every ten infants, with approximately 70% considered late preterm births. In the CDC’s June 2018 National Center for Health Statistics Report, it noted that the preterm birth rate rose in 2018 for the fourth straight year and attributed the rise primarily to an increase in late preterm births, defined as a birth between 34 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, the CDC noted that racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates remain. Although the causes of preterm birth are not fully understood, certain women are at a greater risk for preterm birth, including those who have had a previous preterm birth, are pregnant with multiples or have certain uterine or cervical problems. High blood pressure, pregnancy complications (such as placental problems) and certain other health or lifestyle factors may also be contributing factors. Makena is indicated only for use in women who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth who are pregnant with a single baby, which accounts for approximately 130,000 pregnancies annually in the U.S. 
Preterm birth can increase the risk of infant death and can also result in serious long-term health issues for the child, including respiratory problems, gastrointestinal conditions, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing impairments. According to a 2007 report by the Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy Outcome, the annual societal economic cost associated with preterm birth is at least $26.2 billion and includes medical and healthcare costs for the baby, labor and delivery costs for the mother, early intervention and special education services, and costs associated with lost work and pay.

AMAG-423 
Overview
In September 2018, we acquired the global rights to AMAG-423 for the treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia in antepartum and postpartum women pursuant to an option agreement entered into in July 2015 (the “Velo Agreement”) with Velo Bio, LLC, a privately-held life sciences company (“Velo”). AMAG-423 is an antibody fragment currently in development for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women and has been granted both orphan drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA. AMAG-423 is intended to bind to endogenous digitalis-like factors (“EDLFs”) and remove them from the circulation. EDLFs appear to be elevated in preeclampsia and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia though their inhibitory actions on Na+/K+-ATPase (the sodium pump). By decreasing circulating EDLFs, AMAG-423 is believed to improve vascular endothelial function and lead to better post-delivery outcomes in affected mothers and their babies. 
We are currently conducting a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2b/3a study in which we expect to enroll approximately 200 antepartum women with severe preeclampsia between 23 weeks and 0 days and 31 weeks and six days gestation. The study is enrolling at sites both within the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Participants in the study receive either AMAG-423 or placebo intravenously four times a day over a maximum of four days. The study’s primary endpoint is to demonstrate a reduction in the percentage of babies who develop severe intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), necrotizing enterocolitis (severe inflammation of the infant bowels) or death by 36 weeks corrected gestational age between the AMAG-423 and placebo arms. Secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in maternal creatinine clearance, maternal incidence of pulmonary edema during treatment and the period of time between treatment and delivery. In addition to these endpoints, information on both maternal as well as neonatal outcomes and complications related to preeclampsia and/or prematurity will be collected and analyzed. Severe preeclampsia presents challenges to enrollment as it is an extremely complex and dynamic condition; oftentimes, the patient needs be scheduled for immediate delivery. While we continue to work to obtain the necessary country approvals, opening new sites as well as implementing and optimizing strategies to enhance enrollment, the serious nature of the condition under study and the characteristics of the patient population make it difficult for us to predict the timing of enrollment completion.
Preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is a multi-system disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and baby. Preeclampsia is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and typically develops in women after 20 weeks of pregnancy and is characterized by elevated blood pressure, as well as vascular abnormalities, that can lead to end organ damage, intrauterine growth restriction and premature delivery. Premature delivery can lead to a number of serious health consequences for the infant, including intraventricular hemorrhage or necrotizing enterocolitis. Each year approximately 140,000 pregnant women in the U.S. are affected by preeclampsia, with approximately 50,000 impacted by severe preeclampsia, a more serious form of the condition that can be life threatening to both the mother and the baby. Severe preeclampsia can result in acute, as well as long-term, complications and a progressive deterioration in the clinical presentation for both the mother and the baby. There are currently no effective or FDA-approved treatments that address the underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia or severe preeclampsia. Delivery of the baby is the only definitive way to prevent the progression of the condition and the development of further complications. Therefore, the management of severe preeclampsia is focused on medications to address the symptoms, such as antihypertensives for the urgent control of severe hypertension and magnesium sulfate for the prevention of seizures as well as early delivery of the baby. While oftentimes features of severe preeclampsia can be an indication for delivery, in centers that are well equipped to continuously monitor the status of the mother and the fetus, the physician may choose not to immediately deliver and practice expectant management instead. Expectant management refers to an approach whereby the patient with preeclampsia is managed in an inpatient setting through standard of care measures (including corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturation) while at the same time constantly evaluating the dynamic risks and benefits by monitoring both the mother and the baby, with the goal of increasing the gestational age and improving neonatal outcome. 
Ciraparantag 
In January 2019, we acquired ciraparantag with our acquisition of Perosphere Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Perosphere”), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Perosphere Agreement”). Ciraparantag is a small molecule anticoagulant reversal agent in development as a single dose solution that is delivered intravenously to reverse the effects of certain NOACs (Xarelto®(rivaroxaban), Eliquis®(apixaban), and Savaysa®(edoxaban)) as well as Lovenox® (enoxaparin sodium injection), a low molecular weight heparin (“LMWH”) when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these products is needed for emergency surgery, urgent procedures or due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Ciraparantag has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.
Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was the first FDA-approved oral anticoagulant and for over 60 years was the only oral anticoagulant used in the U.S. Although warfarin is effective in the prevention of thromboembolism, its use necessitates frequent blood monitoring, dose adjustments and dietary restrictions. The first FDA-approved NOAC was Pradaxa®(dabigatran), which was introduced to the U.S. market in 2010. Since then Xarelto®, Eliquis® and Savaysa® were approved by the FDA as an alternative mechanism of action to warfarin in inhibiting the body’s ability to form blood clots. These NOACs offer similar efficacy to warfarin in reducing thromboembolism but are notably safer with respect to serious bleeding events and do not require monitoring for effectiveness. 
The use of NOAC therapy represents the fastest-growing segment of the anticoagulant market in the U.S. with approximately six million patients in the U.S. and nine million patients in certain ex-U.S. countries currently on NOAC and LMWH therapy. In January 2019, the American Heart Association released updated guidelines recommending the use of NOACs over warfarin in the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant treatment, particularly for those patients coming in for emergency surgery or other urgent procedures. Approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of patients on NOACs are at risk for serious bleeding complications each year. Prior to 2015, there were no FDA-approved reversal agents for these anticoagulants. Currently, Praxbind®(idarucizumab) is approved for the reversal of Pradaxa® and Andexxa® (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo) is approved for the reversal of Eliquis® and Xarelto® to treat uncontrolled bleeding in the U.S. as well as in Europe (under the trade name Ondexxya™).
Ciraparantag has been evaluated in more than 250 healthy volunteers across seven clinical trials. A first in human Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects of ciraparantag alone and following a single dose of Savaysa®, and another Phase 1 study evaluated the overall metabolism of the drug. Two Phase 2a studies evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects related to the reversal of unfractionated heparin and Lovenox® and three Phase 2b randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging studies evaluated the reversal of Savaysa®, Eliquis®, and Xarelto® to assess the safety and efficacy of ciraparantag, each of which included 12 subjects dosed with ciraparantag. In these Phase 2b clinical trials, ciraparantag or placebo was administered to healthy volunteers in a blinded fashion after achieving steady blood concentrations of the respective anticoagulant. Pharmacodynamic assessments of whole blood clotting time (“WBCT”), an important laboratory measure of clotting capacity, were sampled frequently for the first hour post study drug dose, and then periodically thereafter out to 24 hours post administration of study drug. Key endpoints in the Phase 2 trials included mean change from baseline in WBCT and the proportion of subjects that returned to within 10% of their baseline WBCT. Subjects in these studies experienced a rapid and statistically significant (p<0.001) reduction in WBCT compared to placebo as early as 15 minutes after the administration of ciraparantag in each of the four studies and the effect was sustained for 24 hours. Moreover, in both the Eliquis® and Xarelto® studies, 100% of subjects in the highest dose cohorts (180 mg of ciraparantag) were responders, as defined by a return to within 10% of baseline WBCT within 30 minutes and sustained for at least six hours. Ciraparantag has been well tolerated in clinical trials, with the most common related adverse events to date being mild sensations of coolness, warmth or tingling, skin flushing, and alterations in taste. There have been no drug-related serious adverse events to date.
We are planning to conduct a clinical study in healthy volunteers to confirm the proposed dose of ciraparantag to be used in the Phase 3 program, after reaching peak steady state blood concentrations of certain NOAC drugs. This proposed study will utilize an automated coagulometer developed by Perosphere Technologies, Inc. (“Perosphere Technologies”), an independent company, to measure WBCT. An investigational device exemption, which Perosphere Technologies will submit once the design of the healthy volunteer study is finalized, is required for use of the coagulometer in clinical studies. Over the past several months, Perosphere Technologies has completed additional analytic studies and we have continued to work with the FDA on the design of this next clinical study. Following the completion of this study, we plan to schedule an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of the Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ciraparantag in the target patient population. We currently expect enrollment in the healthy volunteer study to be completed by the end of 2020, assuming our proposed protocol is acceptable to the FDA and that additional dose exploration is not needed. 
In December 2019, we entered into a termination and settlement agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. to terminate a clinical trial collaboration agreement we acquired in connection with the Perosphere transaction. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we received $10.0 million in December 2019 as a termination payment from Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. In 2019, we also recognized $6.4 million of deferred revenue that we acquired from Perosphere related to the original agreement.
MuGard
We acquired the U.S. commercial rights to MuGard, a prescription oral mucoadhesive, under a June 2013 license agreement with Abeona (the “MuGard Rights”). We ceased selling MuGard at the end of 2019.
Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements
We are currently a party to the following collaborations and other arrangements: 
Velo
In September 2018, we acquired the global rights to AMAG-423. As part of the acquisition, in September 2018 we paid Velo an upfront option exercise fee of $12.5 million. We are obligated to pay Velo a $30.0 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of AMAG-423. In addition, we are obligated to pay sales milestone payments to Velo of up to $240.0 million in the aggregate, triggered at various annual net sales thresholds between $300.0 million and $900.0 million and low-single digit royalties based on net sales. Further, we have assumed additional obligations under a previous agreement entered into by Velo with a third party, including a $5.0 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of AMAG-423 and $10.0 million following the first commercial sale of AMAG-423, payable in quarterly installments as a percentage of quarterly gross commercial sales until the obligation is met. We are also obligated to pay the third party low-single digit royalties based on net sales. 
Perosphere
In January 2019, we acquired Perosphere, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing ciraparantag, a small molecule anticoagulant reversal agent. Pursuant to the Perosphere Agreement, in January 2019, we paid Perosphere approximately $50.0 million. In addition, we used available cash to repay $12.0 million of Perosphere’s term loan indebtedness and assumed approximately $6.2 million of Perosphere’s other liabilities. We are obligated to pay future contingent consideration of up to an aggregate of $365.0 million (the “Milestone Payments”), including (a) up to an aggregate of $140.0 million that becomes payable upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones for ciraparantag (the “Regulatory Milestone Payments”), including a $40.0 million milestone payment upon approval of ciraparantag by the European Medicines Agency and (b) up to an aggregate of $225.0 million that becomes payable conditioned upon the achievement of specified sales milestones (the “Sales Milestone Payments”). If the final label approved for ciraparantag in the U.S. includes a boxed warning, the Regulatory Milestone Payments shall no longer be payable, and any previously paid Regulatory Milestone Payments shall be credited against 50% of any future Milestone Payments that otherwise becomes payable. The first Sales Milestone Payment of $20.0 million will be payable upon annual net sales of ciraparantag of at least $100.0 million. 
Antares
In connection with a development and license agreement (the “Antares License Agreement”) with Antares we have an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to develop, use, sell, offer for sale and import and export the Makena auto-injector. Under the terms of the Antares License Agreement, as amended in March 2018, we are responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications in each country where we desire to market and sell the Makena auto-injector, including the U.S. We are required to pay royalties to Antares on net sales of the Makena auto-injector until the Antares License Agreement is terminated (the “Antares Royalty Term”). The royalty rates range from high single digit to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales of the Makena auto-injector and decrease after the expiration of licensed patents or where there are generic equivalents to the Makena auto-injector being sold in a particular country. In addition, we are required to pay Antares sales milestone payments upon the achievement of certain annual net sales. The Antares License Agreement terminates at the end of the Antares Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party. See below under “Manufacturing” for a description of the manufacturing agreement entered into with Antares in March 2018.
Manufacturing 
Overview
We do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our commercially distributed products or for our product candidates. We rely solely on third-party contract manufacturers and our licensors (who, in turn, may also rely on third-party contract manufacturers) to manufacture our products for our commercial and clinical use. Our third-party drug product contract manufacturing facilities, and those of our licensors, are subject to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) and regulations enforced by the FDA through periodic inspections to confirm such compliance. We target to maintain, where possible, second source suppliers and/or sufficient inventory levels throughout our supply chain to meet our projected near-term demand for all of our products in order to minimize risks of supply disruption. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct more of our financial resources to the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates. 
To support the commercialization and development of our products, we have developed a fully integrated manufacturing support system, including quality assurance, quality control, regulatory affairs and inventory control policies and procedures. These support systems are intended to enable us to maintain high standards of quality for our products.
Feraheme
We are party to a commercial supply agreement with Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (“SAFC”) pursuant to which SAFC agreed to manufacture and we agreed to purchase the API for use in the finished drug product of ferumoxytol for commercial sale as well as for use in clinical trials (as amended, the “SAFC Agreement”). Subject to certain conditions, the SAFC Agreement provides that we purchase all of our API from SAFC. The SAFC Agreement has an initial term that ends on December 31, 2020, which may be automatically extended thereafter for additional two year periods, unless canceled by us or SAFC within an agreed-upon notice period.
We are party to a pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon, Inc. (“Patheon”) pursuant to which Patheon agreed to manufacture ferumoxytol finished drug product for commercial sale and for use in clinical trials (as amended, the “Patheon Agreement”). The Patheon Agreement will continue in force until December 31, 2020. The Patheon Agreement may be terminated at any time upon mutual written agreement by us and Patheon or at any time by us subject to certain notice requirements and early termination fees. In addition, the Patheon Agreement may be terminated by either us or Patheon in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party provided that the breaching party fails to cure such breach within an agreed-upon notice period. 
We have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a second source supplier to produce ferumoxytol finished drug product in addition to Patheon, which second source supplier was approved by the FDA in 2019. 
Makena 
In June 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with SAFC, Inc. (“SAFC Makena”) to supply us with API for use in the finished Makena product (the “SAFC Makena Agreement”). The SAFC Makena Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements, but we are not obligated to use SAFC Makena as our sole supplier of Makena API. The SAFC Makena Agreement expires on June 4, 2021 and may be automatically extended thereafter for additional two year periods, unless canceled by us or SAFC Makena within an agreed-upon notice period. The SAFC Makena Agreement may be terminated by either us or SAFC Makena in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party provided that the breaching party fails to cure such breach within an agreed-upon notice period or insolvency by either party. 
In June 2017, we entered into a product supply agreement with Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) (Kalamazoo facility) to supply us with the API for use in the finished Makena product (the “Pfizer API Agreement”). The Pfizer API Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements but we are not obligated to use Pfizer as our sole supplier of Makena API. The Pfizer API Agreement expires on June 1, 2020 and may be extended thereafter for additional one year periods upon mutual agreement of the parties, unless canceled by us or Pfizer within an agreed-upon notice period. The Pfizer API Agreement may be terminated by either us or Pfizer in the event of an uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party. 
In September 2018, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH (“Fresenius”) to manufacture the pre-filled syringes used in the Makena auto-injector product (the “Fresenius Agreement”). The Fresenius Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements, but we are not obligated to use Fresenius as our sole supplier of pre-filled syringes. The Fresenius Agreement will continue for a set period of time, including mutually agreed upon additional renewals, but may be terminated by either us or Fresenius in the event of an uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party, by Fresenius if we undergo a change of control to a competitor of Fresenius or by us if Fresenius fails to obtain or maintain any material government licenses or approvals. 
Antares is the exclusive supplier for the auto-injection devices needed for the Makena auto-injector. In March 2018, we entered into the Antares Manufacturing Agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Antares agreed to sell to us on an exclusive basis, and we agreed to purchase, the fully packaged Makena auto-injector for commercial distribution. Antares is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the device components and assembly of the Makena auto-injector and we are responsible for the supply of the Makena drug substance in pre-filled syringes to be used in the assembly of the finished auto-injector product. The Antares Manufacturing Agreement terminates at the expiration or earlier termination of the Antares License Agreement, but is subject to early termination by us for certain supply failure situations, and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party or our permanent cessation of commercialization of the Makena auto-injector for efficacy or safety reasons. 
Products in Development
We are party to an exclusive agreement with Protherics UK Ltd, a subsidiary of BTG plc (“BTG”), for the manufacture of AMAG-423 drug substance for use in the AMAG-423 commercial product (the “BTG Agreement”). BTG has also agreed to supply drug product for our current ongoing clinical trial. BTG owns the rights to digoxin immune fab (ovine), the active ingredient of AMAG-423, which has been marketed in the U.S. for many years as an FDA-approved treatment for patients with life-threatening or potentially life-threatening digoxin toxicity or overdose. Under the terms of the BTG Agreement, we are required to differentiate our product from their product, DigiFab®, including without limitation, via labeling, dosage and/or formulation and if we are unable to show differentiation, we may be in breach of the agreement, which could give BTG the right to terminate the agreement and subject us to penalties. In addition, the BTG Agreement provides that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements. We will need to enter into one or more additional agreements to manufacture AMAG-423 drug product, especially if it is approved and we need to meet commercial demand. 
We have also assumed a commercial supply agreement with PolyPeptide Group for the supply of ciraparantag drug substance. We will need to enter into an additional agreement to manufacture ciraparantag drug product, especially if it is approved and we need to meet commercial demand. 
Raw Materials
We, our licensors and our respective third-party manufacturers currently purchase certain raw and other materials used to manufacture our products from third-party suppliers. Although certain of our raw or other materials are readily available, others may be obtained only from qualified suppliers. The qualification of an alternative source may require repeated testing of the new materials and generate greater expenses to us or our licensors if materials that we test do not perform in an acceptable manner. In addition, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers sometimes obtain raw or other materials from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers, which could make us susceptible to price inflation by the sole supplier, thereby increasing our production costs. As a result of the high-quality standards imposed on our raw or other materials, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers may not be able to obtain such materials of the quality required to manufacture our products from an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or in a timely manner, if at all. 
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
We consider the protection of our technology to be material to our business. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for our products and product candidates. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, collaborators and other business partners to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and ensure trade secret protection. We must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties or allowing third parties to infringe our rights. Our policy is to aggressively protect our competitive technology position by a variety of means, including applying for or obtaining rights to patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries. 
One of our U.S. Feraheme patents received a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) and will expire in June 2023, and the other U.S. patents relating to Feraheme will expire in 2020. In addition, in March 2018, we and Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) entered a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to a settlement agreement that dismissed and resolved a patent infringement suit regarding an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) submitted to the FDA by Sandoz. According to the terms of the settlement, if Sandoz receives FDA approval of its ANDA by a certain date, Sandoz may launch its generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances customary for settlement agreements of this nature. Sandoz will pay a royalty on the sales of its generic version of Feraheme to us until the expiration of the last Feraheme patent listed in the Orange Book. If Sandoz is unable to secure approval by such date, Sandoz will launch an authorized generic version of Feraheme supplied by us on July 15, 2022 for up to 12 months. Sandoz’s right to distribute, and our obligation to supply, the authorized generic product shall be in accordance with standard commercial terms and profit splits. 
Our U.S. patents related to the Makena auto-injector product will expire in 2036, and we have a pending patent application related to the Makena auto-injector product. In addition, we have a license to several U.S. patents and patent applications from Antares related to the Makena auto-injector device and drug-device combination with expiration dates between 2026 and 2034. Our issued patent and Antares’ eligible patents are listed in the Orange Book for the Makena auto-injector product.
Under the terms of the Velo Agreement, we obtained four issued U.S. patents covering methods of using AMAG-423 to treat women exhibiting symptoms of preeclampsia or eclampsia, each of which expires in November 2022, and several corresponding foreign patents that expire in 2023. Digoxin immune fab (ovine), the active ingredient of AMAG-423, has been approved and marketed in the U.S. for many years for a different indication and no longer has composition of matter patent protection. Accordingly, we do not have and will not be able to obtain composition of matter patent protection for AMAG-423. AMAG-423 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and, if approved, we expect it to receive seven years of marketing exclusivity.
Additionally, under the terms of the Perosphere Agreement, we obtained two issued U.S. patents and several foreign patents related to ciraparantag. One U.S. patent includes claims directed to the ciraparantag drug composition of matter with a term that expires in 2034, and the other U.S. patent includes claims directed to methods of using ciraparantag to reverse the anticoagulation effect of certain coagulation inhibitors with a term that expires in 2032. All of the foreign patents expire in 2032. Either of the issued U.S. patents may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. Whether either of these U.S. patents will be granted patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the length of any such extension cannot be determined until a product covered by such patents receives FDA approval.
With regard to pending patent applications we own or have rights to, even though further patents may be issued on such applications, we cannot be sure that any such patents will be issued on a timely basis, if at all, or with a scope that provides our products with additional protection. The claims of issued patents related to any of our products may not provide meaningful protection for the product, and third parties may challenge the validity or scope of any such issued patents. Additionally, the claims of our issued patents may be narrowed or invalidated by administrative proceedings, such as interference or derivation, inter partes review, post grant review or reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, existing or future patents of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products.
We also have numerous U.S. and foreign trademark registrations directed to our corporate and affiliate names, as well as our products and compliance programs. These marks help to further distinguish our products and enhance our overall intellectual property position.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our existing or potential competitors for all our products have or may develop products that are more widely accepted than ours, are viewed as more safe, effective, convenient or easier to administer, have been on the market longer and have stronger patient/provider loyalty, have been approved for a larger patient population, are less expensive or offer more attractive insurance coverage, discounts, reimbursements, incentives or rebates and may have or receive patent protection that dominates, blocks, makes obsolete or adversely affects our product development or business. 
Feraheme
Many of our competitors for Feraheme are large, well-known pharmaceutical companies and may benefit from significantly greater financial, sales and marketing capabilities, greater technological or competitive advantages, and other resources. 
Feraheme currently competes primarily with the following IV iron replacement therapies for the treatment of IDA:

• | Injectafer®, a ferric carboxymaltose injection, which is approved to treat IDA in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron. Injectafer® is also indicated for IDA in adult patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. Injectafer® is marketed in the U.S. by American Regent, the same distributor of Venofer®;


• | Venofer®, an iron sucrose complex, which is approved for use in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, non-dialysis dependent CKD patients and pediatric CKD patients and is marketed in the U.S. by Fresenius Medical Care North America and American Regent, Inc. (“American Regent”), a subsidiary of Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a business unit of Daiichi Sankyo Group);


• | A generic version of Ferrlecit® marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;


• | INFeD®, an iron dextran product marketed by Allergan, Inc. which is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral iron administration is unsatisfactory or impossible;


• | Ferrlecit®, a sodium ferric gluconate, which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, is approved for use only in hemodialysis patients; and


• | Auryxia®(ferric citrate), an oral phosphate binder, which is marketed by Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD not on dialysis.

In addition to the currently marketed products described above, in the future Feraheme will likely compete with Monoferric™ (iron isomaltoside 1000 for injection) (global brand name Monofer®), which is marketed by Pharmacosmos A/S in over 30 countries outside the U.S., including Canada. In January 2020, Monoferric® (ferric derisomaltose) injection 100 mg/mL was approved by the FDA for the treatment of IDA in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or who have non-hemodialysis dependent CKD. Monoferric® can be administered in a single-dose 1,000 mg infusion and does not have a boxed warning, which healthcare providers or patients may prefer over multi-dose products with a boxed warning like Feraheme. We are aware that American Regent filed a lawsuit in February 2020 against Pharmacosmos alleging that Monoferric® infringes two of American Regent’s patents. In addition, there are several hypoxia inducible factor stabilizers in various stages of development to treat anemia related to CKD that could potentially compete with Feraheme in the future, a number of which are currently in Phase III trials. 
Companies that manufacture generic products typically invest far fewer resources in research and development than the manufacturers of branded products and can therefore price their products significantly lower than those branded products already on the market. Therefore, competition from generic IV iron products could limit our sales. Feraheme may face future competition from generic IV iron replacement therapy products. For example, under our settlement agreement with Sandoz, if Sandoz receives FDA approval by a certain date, Sandoz may launch its generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2021. If Sandoz is unable to secure approval by such date, Sandoz may launch an authorized generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2022 for up to twelve months. 
Based on sales data provided to us by IQVIA Holdings Inc. (“IQVIA”), we estimate that the size of the total 2019 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.5 million grams, which represents an increase of approximately12% over 2018. Based on this IQVIA data, the following represents the 2019 and 2018 U.S. market share allocation of the total non-dialysis IV iron market based on the volume of IV iron administered:
 | 2019 U.S. Non-dialysis IV Iron Market | 2018 U.S. Non-dialysis IV Iron Market
 | (1.52 million grams) | (1.36 million grams) 
Injectafer® | 35% | 33% 
Venofer® | 32% | 34% 
Feraheme | 17% | 15% 
Generic sodium ferric gluconate | 8% | 9% 
INFeD® | 5% | 6% 
Ferrlecit® | 3% | 3% 

The market share data listed in the table above is not necessarily indicative of the market shares in dollars due to the variations in selling prices among the IV iron products. 
Makena
Makena competition currently comes mainly from generic formulations of HPC injections as well as from pharmacies that compound a non-FDA approved version of Makena. Currently, there are five generic versions of Makena, sold as 1ml and/or 5ml IM vials and no generic auto-injector products. We expect to face additional competition for Makena from future generic products as well as potentially from products currently in development that offer alternative formulations or routes of administration, such as an oral HPC product. 
Based on IQVIA data and internal analytics, we estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Makena auto-injector made up approximately 63% of the total prescriptions written for all FDA-approved HPC products. In addition to FDA-approved products for the approved indication, other at-risk patients are treated with compounded formulations of HPC or other therapies, such as vaginal progesterone, which are not approved for women pregnant with a single baby with a prior history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. Given the current uncertainty of Makena, healthcare providers may utilize these alternatives with increasing frequency.
Ciraparantag
Currently, we expect ciraparantag, if approved, will compete primarily with Andexxa® (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo), which was approved in 2018 in the U.S. and in 2019 in Europe (under the trade name Ondexxya™) for the reversal of Eliquis® and Xarelto® for patients treated with Eliquis® and Xarelto®, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Andexxa® is also in development for the reversal of Savaysa® and Lovenox®. Ciraparantag is in development as an anticoagulant reversal agent to reverse the effects of Eliquis®, Xarelto®, Savaysa® and Lovenox®. Based on clinical data to date, we expect that ciraparantag will be a ready-to-use product with the potential to be stored at room temperature and to be administered at a fixed dose for the NOACs and LMWH being studied. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Feraheme
We sell Feraheme to authorized wholesalers and specialty distributors who, in turn, sell Feraheme to healthcare providers who administer Feraheme primarily within hospitals and hematology and oncology clinics. Since many hospitals and hematology and oncology practices are members of GPOs, which leverage the purchasing power of a group of entities to obtain discounts based on the collective bargaining power of the group, we also routinely enter into pricing agreements with GPOs in these markets so the members of the GPOs have access to Feraheme and to the related discounts or rebates. 
Our sales and marketing organization uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote Feraheme, including sales calls to purchasing entities, such as hospitals and hematology and oncology clinics, in addition to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals, medical education symposia, promotional materials, local and national educational programs, and scientific meetings and conferences. In addition, we provide customer service and other related programs for Feraheme, including prescription coverage information support services, a patient assistance program for eligible uninsured or functionally under-insured patients and a customer service call center. 
Makena 
Makena prescriptions are dispensed via the payer-preferred pharmacy networks or purchased directly by hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery networks. Our sales and marketing teams use a variety of strategies and focused, multi-channel methods to promote Makena, including dedicating a managed care team to focus on health plans, including commercial payers, pharmacy benefit managers, and managed Medicaid plans as well as fee-for-service Medicaid programs. 
In addition, we offer customer support through the Makena Care Connection, which is designed to help navigate each individual patient’s needs throughout the Makena prescription process, including confirming insurance coverage, providing education and support on prior authorizations (when applicable), and working in collaboration with a payer-preferred pharmacy and home health agency to help ensure timely initiation of therapy. The Makena Care Connection also screens eligible patients for and enrolls eligible patients in financial assistance programs including (a) our copay savings program, which helps lower the out-of-pocket cost for commercially insured patients whose plan covers Makena, and (b) our patient assistance program, which provides a full course of therapy at no cost to eligible uninsured and commercially underinsured patients. Additionally, the Makena Care Connection offers education and adherence support to eligible patients to assist with increasing patient compliance by encouraging adherence to the weekly Makena injection schedule. 
Product Supply Chain
We outsource a number of our product supply chain services for our products to third-party logistics providers, including services related to warehousing and inventory management, distribution, chargeback processing, accounts receivable management, sample distribution to our sales force and customer service call center management.
Major Customers
The following table sets forth customers who represented 10% or more of our total revenues for 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
McKesson Corporation | 36 | % | | 26 | % | 24 | %
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation | 28 | % | | 27 | % | 26 | %
Cardinal Health | 13 | % | | < 10% | | < 10% | 

The loss of any of the above customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Government Regulation 
Overview
Our activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research and development, approval, label, post-approval monitoring and reporting of adverse events, manufacturing, quality control, recordkeeping, storage, distribution, and advertising and promotional labeling of pharmaceutical and biological products and medical devices. 
Failure to comply with any of the applicable U.S. requirements may result in a variety of administrative or judicially imposed sanctions including, among other things, the regulatory agency’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension, variations or withdrawals of approval, clinical holds, “warning” or “untitled” letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
Product Development and Approval Process
Clinical Development
Before we may market a new product, we must obtain FDA approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for a drug product or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic, such as AMAG-423. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA if, among other requirements, the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate can be established based on the results of preclinical and clinical studies.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice regulations. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical testing. Prior to beginning a clinical trial, an investigational new drug application (an “IND”), which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans in clinical trials, must be submitted to the FDA and must become effective. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”), before any trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. Additional ongoing regulatory requirements apply throughout the course of a clinical trial, including requirements governing the reporting of certain ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical testing typically proceeds in three phases, which may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials seek to collect initial data about safety, tolerability, and optimal dosing of the investigational product in healthy human subjects or, less commonly, in patients with the target disease or condition. The goal of Phase 2 trials is to provide preliminary evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the investigational product in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects with the target disease or condition. Phase 3 trials generally consist of expanded, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, multi-center studies of the safety and efficacy of the product in the target patient population and are used as the primary basis for regulatory approval. 
Submission and FDA Review of NDAs, sNDAs, BLAs and sBLAs
Following the successful completion of clinical trials, the sponsor submits the results to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. The NDA or BLA must also include the results of preclinical tests and studies, as the FDA requires submission of all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as, among other required information, information related to the preparation and manufacturing of the drug or biologic candidate, analytical methods, and proposed packaging and labeling. Pursuant to agreements reached during reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has a goal of acting on most original NDAs and BLAs within six months or ten months of the application submission or filing date (the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing), depending on the nature of the drug. Once the NDA or BLA submission has been accepted for filing (60 days post receipt of the application by the FDA, if at all), the FDA typically takes ten months to review the application and respond to the applicant. The review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts. The FDA can also call an advisory committee at other times and for other purposes, such as to discuss the results of post-approval studies. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA or BLA and of the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter, and the sponsor may begin marketing the drug for the approved indications, subject to any post-approval requirements, described further below. If the FDA determines it cannot approve the NDA or BLA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter indicating that the application will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the application and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA of BLA. Addressing the deficiencies noted by the FDA could be impractical, and it is possible that the sponsor could withdraw its application or approval may not be obtained or may be costly and may result in significant delays prior to approval.
Where a sponsor wishes to expand the originally approved prescribing information, such as adding a new indication, it must submit and obtain approval of an sNDA or supplemental BLA (“sBLA”). Changes to an indication generally require additional clinical studies, which can be time-consuming and require the expenditure of substantial additional resources. Under PDUFA, the target timeframe for the review of an sNDA to add a new clinical indication is six or ten months from the receipt date, depending on whether or not the sNDA has priority review. As with an NDA or BLA, if the FDA determines that it cannot approve an sNDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter as discussed above. 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
The FDA has a number of programs intended to help expedite testing, review, and approval of drug candidates that meet the applicable eligibility criteria such as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a Fast Track-designated product, the FDA may consider review of completed sections of an NDA or BLA on a rolling basis provided the sponsor provides, and the FDA accepts, a schedule for the submission of the completed sections of the NDA or BLA. This process is called rolling review. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a rolling review application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. 
A drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if the drug is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides for frequent meetings between the sponsor and the FDA, involving senior and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-functional review and the assignment of an FDA project lead to facilitate efficient review of the development program and serve as a scientific liaison with the sponsor. Breakthrough Therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of Fast Track designation, which means that the sponsor may also be eligible for rolling review.
A product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development or review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Priority review means that, for a new molecular entity or original BLA, the FDA sets a target date for FDA action on the marketing application at six months after accepting the application for filing as opposed to ten months. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application for a new molecular entity or original BLA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the disease or condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a product or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval.
Abbreviated New Drug Application
The Hatch-Waxman Act created the ANDA pathway, which allows companies to seek approval for generic versions of brand-name drugs previously approved under an NDA and listed in the Orange Book. Rather than directly demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy, as is required of an NDA, an ANDA must show that the proposed generic product is the same as the previously approved product in terms of active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form and route of administration. In addition, with certain exceptions, the generic product must have the same labeling as the product to which it refers. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved product if, in relevant part, “the rate and extent of absorption of the [generic] drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
NDA applicants and holders must provide certain information about patents related to the branded drug for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the branded product that is the reference listed drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send appropriate notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within 20 days of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application (a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted) being accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of expiration of the patent, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant, or 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice (which can be extended if the reference product has 5-year exclusivity and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted between four and five years after approval of the reference product).
The Hatch-Watchman Act also provides for a 180-day period of generic product exclusivity for the first generic applicant to submit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification for a generic version of an NDA-approved drug. Generic pharmaceutical products that are introduced by innovator companies, either directly or through partnering arrangements with other generic companies, are known as authorized generics. Authorized generics are equivalent to the innovator companies' brand name drugs but are sold at relatively lower prices than the brand name drugs. An authorized generic product may be marketed during the 180-day exclusivity period granted to the first manufacturer to submit an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification for a generic version of the brand product.
Adverse Event Reporting
The FDA requires a sponsor to submit reports of certain information on side effects and adverse events associated with its products that occur either during clinical trials or after marketing approval. These requirements include specific and timely notification of certain serious, unexpected and/or frequent adverse events, as well as regular periodic reports summarizing adverse drug experiences. Failure to comply with these FDA safety reporting requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may include civil action or criminal penalties. In addition, as a result of these reports, the FDA could create a Tracked Safety Issue for a product in the FDA’s Document Archiving, Reporting and Regulatory Tracking System, place additional limitations on an approved product’s use, such as through labeling changes, or, potentially, could require withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA could require post-approval studies or impose distribution and use restrictions and other requirements via a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) based upon new safety information obtained through adverse event reporting (discussed further below).
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Even if initial approval of an NDA, sNDA, BLA, or sBLA is granted, such approval may be subject to post-approval regulatory requirements, any or all of which may adversely impact a sponsor’s ability to effectively market and sell the approved product. The FDA may require the sponsor to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials, also known as post-marketing requirements, to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. In addition, the FDA and the sponsor may agree to the conduct of certain post-market studies, known as post-marketing commitments, to further obtain safety and efficacy information. The results of such post-marketing requirement or commitment studies may be negative and could lead to limitations on the further marketing of a product, including safety labeling changes. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to implement a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with the product. Failure to comply with REMS requirements may result in civil penalties. Further, if an approved product encounters any safety or efficacy issues, including drug interaction problems, the FDA has broad authority to require the sponsor to take any number of actions, including, but not limited to, undertaking post-approval clinical studies, implementing labeling changes, adopting a REMS, issuing Dear Health Care Provider letters, or removing the product from the market. Under PREA, the FDA may require pediatric assessment of certain drugs unless waived or deferred due to the fact that necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical to conduct in the specified age group or where the drug is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group. 
FDA Regulation of our Products 
FDA Regulation of Product Advertising and Promotional Labeling
The FDA also regulates all advertising and promotional labeling for prescription drugs, both prior to and after approval. Approved pharmaceutical products must be promoted in a manner consistent with their product label, including the scope of their approved use. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (“off-label promotion”) or for other violations of its advertising and promotional labeling laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to, among other things, adverse publicity, product seizures, civil or criminal penalties, or regulatory letters, which may include warnings and require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals.
Promotional labeling and advertising materials for all prescription pharmaceutical products must be submitted to the FDA’s Office of Promotional Drug Products (“OPDP”) at the time of initial dissemination or publication. However, under the accelerated approval regulations, promotional materials for drugs or biologics approved under Subpart H or E, respectively, and not yet converted to a full marketing approval, such as Makena, must be submitted for review to the OPDP at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the promotional labeling or initial publication of the advertisement. This extra requirement means that there is a longer lead time before we are able to introduce new promotional material to the market for Makena and other products approved via the accelerated approval pathway and sponsors are subject to increased scrutiny prior to using promotional pieces.
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Facilities 
Manufacturing procedures and quality control for approved drugs must conform to cGMP. Domestic manufacturing establishments must follow cGMP at all times and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. In addition, prior to approval of an NDA, sNDA, BLA, or sBLA, the FDA will often perform a pre-approval inspection of the sponsor’s manufacturing facility, including its equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes, to determine the facility’s compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. Vendors that supply finished products or components to the sponsor that are used to manufacture, package, and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections. If the FDA identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter should be issued for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may result in agency consideration of an enforcement action. 
Product approval may be delayed or denied due to cGMP non-compliance or other issues at the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities or contractor sites or suppliers included in the NDA, sNDA, BLA or sBLA, and the complete resolution of these inspectional findings may be beyond the sponsor’s control. If the FDA determines that the sponsor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the sponsor, including suspension of its manufacturing operations.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient population of fewer than 200,000. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period, except in very limited circumstances. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for an approved indication if that indication is for the treatment of a condition broader than that for which it received orphan drug designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Finally, the FDA may approve a subsequent drug that is otherwise the same as a currently approved orphan drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period if the sponsor of the subsequent drug can demonstrate that the drug is clinically superior to the already approved drug. According to FDA regulations, clinical superiority may be demonstrated by showing that a drug is more effective in a clinical trial, safer in a substantial portion of the target population, or provides a major contribution to patient care relative to the currently approved drug. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
Our general operations, and the research, development, manufacture, sale, and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, FDA regulations, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and their state analogues, and similar laws in countries outside of the U.S., laws governing sampling and distribution of products and government price reporting laws.

• | The AKS prohibits the knowing and willful exchange of remuneration (which the statute broadly defines as anything of value) for referrals for any item or service payable by federal healthcare programs, including prescription drugs, biologics, or medical devices. Liability may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, federal law now provides that the government may assert that a claim including items resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA, described below. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have enacted similar anti-kickback laws, including in laws that prohibit paying or receiving remuneration to induce a referral or recommendation of an item or service reimbursed by any payer, including private payers.


• | The FCA imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement of drugs for payment by a federal healthcare program. The FCA also prohibits making, using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim, avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, or having possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the federal government and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered, less than all of that money or property. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers so that claims are presented for payment for a condition other than that for which the patient was treated. Claims which include items resulting from a violation of the AKS are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. The FCA permits a private individual called a Relator (also referred to as a “whistleblower”) to bring a “qui tam” action (a lawsuit in which the Relator sues on behalf of the federal government and shares in any monetary recovery. Government enforcement agencies and Relators have asserted liability under the FCA for, among other things, claims for items not provided as claimed or for medically unnecessary items, kickbacks, promotion of off-label uses, and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies. Many states have enacted similar false claims laws, including in some cases laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer, not just government programs.


• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, contain many provisions applicable to pharmaceutical companies, including the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the codification of Health Care Fraud as a criminal offense. These laws impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payer programs), or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes standards to protect personal health information. The laws impose both civil monetary and criminal penalties, including penalties directly applicable to “business associates” of HIPAA covered entities, and authorize state attorneys general to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “ACA”), imposed annual federal reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2012, these reporting obligations were extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Many states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state and make periodic public disclosure on sales and marketing activities and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws, we could be subject to state and federal penalty provisions.


• | The FCPA prohibits U.S. publicly-traded companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records, as well as an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we violate the FCPA, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties.

Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under the above referenced laws. Federal and state authorities continue to devote significant attention and resources to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in bringing lawsuits on behalf of the government under the FCA. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry; however, these laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws in the context of particular industry practices. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, or our contractors are or will be in compliance will all federal, state, and foreign regulations. If we or our representatives fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of administrative, civil and criminal fines, penalties, and/or other sanctions could be imposed on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on how we market and sell our products, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, significant fines, exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, litigation, reputational harm, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance or other sanctions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such investigations or suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which can also have an adverse effect on our business.
Our activities are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities including the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Several states have enacted legislation requiring manufacturers operating within the state to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities. In addition, as discussed above, as part of the ACA, certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices are required to publicly report gifts and other payments or transfers of value made to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers. Compliance with these laws is difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we may face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and we could receive adverse publicity which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are also subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address data privacy and information security). The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact certain of our business activities. The CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. 
In addition, as discussed above, in the course of our business, we may obtain health information from third parties (i.e., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits) we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA/HITECH. We are also subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. 
We are also impacted by the data privacy and information security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in the countries in which we do business relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the European Union (the “EU”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules. The GDPR extended the geographical scope of EU data protection law to non-EU entities under certain conditions, tightened existing EU data protection principles and created new obligations for companies and new rights for individuals. Guidance, interpretation and enforcement, particularly in the clinical trial space and healthcare space, under the GDPR are still developing. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, expose us to substantial potential fines and increase our compliance costs. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. 
Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. 
U. S. Healthcare Reform
Our revenue and operations could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Since its enactment, however, there have been modifications and challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA. In 2020, litigation, regulation, and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing. replacing, and/or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. Individual states in the U.S. have passed legislation and implemented regulations requiring reporting related to notification of certain price increases and submissions on justifications for certain price increases. The enforcement of individual state requirements is uncertain, but failure to comply could expose us to substantial financial penalties and the potential for adverse publicity. The number of states establishing requirements to report pricing or otherwise designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing is likely to continue to increase, creating a regulatory landscape of substantial complexity. The pace of change and varying demand of individual state requirements may make it very difficult to comply.
Drug-Device Combination Regulation
Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and a device). Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. The Makena auto-injector and Vyleesi are considered drug-device combination products because of their injection delivery devices and are regulated under this framework. 
Medical Device Regulation 
All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Investigational Device Exception (“IDE”) regulations that among other things, govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. The IDE application must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
Medical devices are similarly subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive post-approval regulation under the FDCA. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as premarket notification (the “510(k) process”), requires a sponsor to obtain 510(k) clearance by demonstrating that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device that is not subject to premarket approval. The second, more rigorous process, known as premarket approval, requires a sponsor to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective.
Both before and after a device is commercially released, there are ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. For example, the FDA requires that device manufacturers maintain particular reviews, design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. If the FDA were to conclude that a sponsor is not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of its medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could, depending on the FDA’s specific findings, require the sponsor to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against the sponsor or its officers and employees.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products is dependent, in significant part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments is available from third-party payers, including state and federal governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations.
Coverage by third-party payers depends on several factors, including the third-party’s determination that the product is clinically and cost effective both individually and within its therapeutic class. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products (including combination products) and continue to institute cost containment measures to control or influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products, such as through the use of prior authorizations and step therapy. There is a continued scrutiny, intensifying criticism and political focus on pharmaceutical pricing practices at both national and regional levels. Especially in the U.S., state legislators are implementing a variety of regulations intended to increase the transparency of bio-pharmaceutical pricing, which may lead to future price control regulations at state levels. Federally, multiple price control mechanisms have been suggested in the recent past, and bi-partisan focus on the issues remains a high priority. Consolidation of pharmacy benefit managers and managed care organizations is also increasing the pricing pressure in the private sector. If these third-party payers provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement for our products, physicians and other healthcare providers may choose to prescribe alternative products, including generics, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program that is administered by the states for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and other individuals with disabilities. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. The calculation of the rebate is defined by law and is based on the quarterly reported average manufacture price (“AMP”) and best price to CMS for each product. The rebate amount is adjusted upward if AMP increases more than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are also required to report revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period. These revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. Further, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective as of April 2016, require state Medicaid programs to reimburse certain brand name covered outpatient drugs at actual acquisition cost plus a dispensing fee. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program provides for civil monetary penalties.
Medicare is a federal health insurance program, administered by CMS, for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions, irrespective of their age. Medicare Part B covers (a) products administered by physicians or other healthcare practitioners, (b) products provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment, and (c) certain oral anti-cancer and immunosuppressive drugs. We are required to provide average sales price (“ASP”) information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The submitted information is used to calculate a Medicare payment rate using ASP plus a specified percentage. These rates are adjusted periodically. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statutes provide for civil monetary penalties.
Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e. drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician), including combination products. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, administered by private prescription drug plan sponsors approved by the U.S. government. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs; and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with the manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 70% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
Effective January 2018, CMS adopted a policy to pay for separately payable, non-pass-through drugs and biologicals other than vaccines purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Services Act (the “340B Program”), with certain exceptions, at the ASP minus 22.5% rather than ASP plus 6%. Drugs not purchased under the 340B Program will continue to be paid for at a rate of ASP plus 6%. This decrease in reimbursement has been challenged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals; a decision is expected in early 2020. There have been significant increases in budget pressure, which may adversely impact premium priced agents, such as Feraheme and Makena.
Our products are available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), pursuant to a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), in which we are required to offer deeply discounted pricing to four federal agencies: VA; Department of Defense (“DOD”); the Coast Guard; and Public Health Service (“PHS”) (including the Indian Health Service) (together the “Big Four”). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is not to exceed the price we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Big Four (including products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if the non-FAMP increases more than inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.
Federal law requires that any company participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the PHS’s 340B Program for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B Program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. 
Federal, state and local governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. Since 2017, several states and local governments have either implemented or are considering implementation of price transparency legislation that may prevent or limit our ability to take price increases at certain rates or frequencies. To date, no fewer than fifteen states have implemented regulations addressing drug pricing transparency with requirements that may include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors, wholesale acquisition cost (“WAC”) disclosure to prescribers and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. For example, in 2017, California enacted a new law to facilitate greater transparency in brand-name and generic drug pricing through the implementation of specific advance notice and price reporting requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers This and other legislation could limit the price and/or payment for prescription drugs. If adequate reimbursement levels are not maintained by government and other third-party payers for our products, our ability to sell our products may be limited and/or our ability to establish acceptable pricing levels may be impaired, thereby reducing anticipated revenues and profitability.
Success of any products we may ultimately seek approval to commercialize outside of the U.S. will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining governmental coverage, as governmental healthcare programs tend to be the dominant third-party payers. Products that are not covered and funded by government entities are unlikely to be used in these markets. We cannot be certain we can obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products in markets outside the U.S. Additionally, ability to market our products on a profitable basis may be limited, given that governments control prices of prescription medicines through mechanisms such as, but not limited to, international price referencing, therapeutic price reference, price cuts, rebates, revenue related taxes, and profit controls. In markets outside the U.S., the price of prescription medicines tends to decline over the life of the medicine and/or as the volume increases, making it difficult to achieve expected growth in revenue.
Products to be Divested 
In January 2020, following a review of our product portfolio and strategy, we announced that we would be pursuing options to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi from our product portfolio.
Intrarosa
In February 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Endoceutics License Agreement”) with Endoceutics pursuant to which Endoceutics granted us the U.S. rights to Intrarosa, an FDA-approved product for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Intrarosa was approved by the FDA in November 2016 and was launched commercially in July 2017. Intrarosa is the only FDA-approved vaginal non-estrogen treatment indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Intrarosa contains prasterone, a synthetic form of dehydroepiandrosterone (“DHEA”), which is an inactive endogenous (i.e. occurring in the body) sex steroid. The mechanism of action of Intrarosa is not fully established. Intrarosa is contraindicated in women with undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding and its label contains a precaution that it has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer.
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $50.0 million and issued 600,000 shares of unregistered common stock to Endoceutics, which had a value of $13.5 million, as measured on April 3, 2017, the date of closing. In addition, we paid Endoceutics $10.0 million in 2017 upon the delivery by Endoceutics of Intrarosa launch quantities and $10.0 million in 2018 following the first anniversary of the closing. Endoceutics is also eligible to receive certain sales milestone payments and tiered royalties equal to a percentage of net sales of Intrarosa in the U.S. 
The Endoceutics License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated, including by either party for material breach that is uncured after a 90-day notice period (subject to certain extensions and dispute resolutions provisions). Either party may terminate under certain situations relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement for a valid business reason upon 365 days prior written notice to Endoceutics, or upon 60 days written notice in the event we reasonably determine in good faith, after due inquiry and after discussions with Endoceutics, that we cannot reasonably continue to develop or commercialize the product as a result of a safety issue regarding the use of Intrarosa. We may also terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement upon 180 days’ notice if there is a change of control of AMAG and the acquiring entity (alone or with its affiliates) is engaged in a competing program (as defined in the Endoceutics License Agreement) in the U.S. or in at least three countries within the EU. 
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, we received rights to U.S. patents and applications related to Intrarosa that are controlled by Endoceutics. One issued patent includes drug product claims with a term that expires in 2031, and two additional issued patents include method of use claims and pharmaceutical dosage form claims with terms that expire in 2028. Either of the patents expiring in 2028 may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. However, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant such an extension. 
In April 2017, we entered into an exclusive commercial supply agreement with Endoceutics pursuant to which Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, agreed to manufacture and supply Intrarosa to us (the “Endoceutics Supply Agreement”) and is our exclusive supplier of Intrarosa in the U.S., subject to certain rights for us to manufacture and supply Intrarosa in the event of a cessation notice or supply failure (as such terms are defined in the Endoceutics Supply Agreement). Endoceutics is developing internal manufacturing capabilities for Intrarosa, for which we expect a decision from the FDA in April 2020, which would give Endoceutics additional manufacturing capacity for the U.S. market. The Endoceutics Supply Agreement will generally remain in effect until the termination of the Endoceutics License Agreement. 
Intrarosa faces competition from a number of approved products, both branded and generic, as well as certain over the counter and compounded remedies that are marketed for dyspareunia or VVA and over the counter and compounded products that contain DHEA. 

• | Estradiol® Vaginal Cream USP, 0.01% (generic version of Estrace®), including a generic marketed by Mylan N.V., which was launched in December 2017, a generic marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”), which was launched in early 2018, a generic marketed by Impax Laboratories, Inc., which was launched in mid-2018, and a generic marketed by Alvogen Inc., which was launched in mid-2018;


• | Estradiol vaginal inserts USP (generic versions of Vagifem®), including Yuvafem, which is marketed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, a generic marketed by Teva and a generic marketed by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc.;


• | Premarin Vaginal Cream®, a vaginal cream for the treatment of VVA marketed by Pfizer;


• | Osphena®, an oral therapy marketed by Duchesnay Inc. for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause;


• | Estring®(estradiol vaginal ring), a vaginal ring marketed by Pfizer for the treatment of VVA due to menopause;


• | Estrace® Cream (Estradiol vaginal cream, USP 0.01%), a vaginal cream for the treatment of VVA marketed by Allergan PLC;


• | IMVEXXY® (estradiol vaginal inserts), an estrogen indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause, which was launched in mid-2018 and is marketed by TherapeuticsMD, Inc.;


• | Vagifem® (estradiol vaginal inserts), a suppository marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S for the treatment of VVA; and


• | Over the counter and compounded remedies that are marketed for dyspareunia or VVA and over the counter and compounded products that contain DHEA.

In July 2017, Intrarosa became available for healthcare provider prescribing and can be ordered through wholesalers and retail pharmacies. Despite significant marketing and educational efforts by industry participants intended to spread awareness of the condition and its treatment, studies suggest that women often do not recognize dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, as a treatable medical condition and are often not aware of treatment options. We will continue to educate healthcare providers and patients on dyspareunia and the benefits of Intrarosa as a treatment option and to support our sampling program, which makes samples of Intrarosa available to healthcare providers through our sales representatives, and to offer a comprehensive copay savings program to patients. 
Vyleesi
In January 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Palatin License Agreement”) with Palatin Technologies, Inc. (“Palatin”), which provides us with (a) an exclusive license in all countries of North America (the “Palatin Territory”), with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research, develop and commercialize Vyleesi and any other products containing bremelanotide (collectively, the “Vyleesi Products”), (b) a worldwide non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to manufacture the Vyleesi Products, and (c) a non-exclusive license in all countries outside the Palatin Territory, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research and develop (but not commercialize) the Vyleesi Products. On June 21, 2019, the FDA approved Vyleesi for the treatment of acquired, generalized HSDD in premenopausal women, and Vyleesi became commercially available in the U.S. in September 2019 through specialty pharmacies.
Under the terms of the Palatin License Agreement, in February 2017 we paid Palatin $60.0 million as a one-time upfront payment and subject to agreed-upon deductions we reimbursed Palatin approximately $25.0 million for reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Palatin in connection with the development and regulatory activities necessary to submit the Vyleesi NDA in the U.S. In June 2018, our NDA submission to the FDA for Vyleesi was accepted, which triggered a $20.0 million milestone payment, which we paid to Palatin in the second quarter of 2018. In June 2019, the FDA approval of Vyleesi triggered a $60.0 million milestone payment to Palatin, which we paid and recorded as an intangible asset in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, we are required to pay royalties on net sales of Vyleesi and regulatory and sales milestone payments to Palatin. 
Vyleesi, a melanocortin receptor agonist, is an “as needed” therapy used in anticipation of sexual activity and self-administered by premenopausal women with HSDD in the thigh or abdomen via a single-use subcutaneous auto-injector. The most common adverse events are nausea, flushing, injection site reactions, headache and vomiting. Vyleesi is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or known cardiovascular disease. In addition, the Vyleesi label includes precautions that it may cause (i) small, transient increases in blood pressure with a corresponding decrease in heart rate; (ii) focal hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin on certain parts of the body), including the face, gums (gingiva) and breasts; and (iii) nausea.
As part of the approval of Vyleesi, the FDA has required us to conduct three post-marketing studies. Two of these studies (one prospective and one retrospective registry) will be designed to investigate maternal, fetal/neonatal and infant outcomes in women exposed to Vyleesi during pregnancy. The third study will be designed to evaluate potential adverse outcomes from exposure to Vyleesi via breast milk from lactating women.
The Palatin License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Palatin License Agreement without cause, in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon at least 180 days prior written notice to Palatin. Either party may terminate the Palatin License Agreement for cause if the other party materially breaches or defaults in the performance of its obligations, and, if curable, such material breach remains uncured for 90 days. 
Under the Palatin License Agreement, we assumed a long-term commercial supply agreement with Catalent Belgium S.A. for drug product manufacture and packaging services for Vyleesi. In June 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Lonza Ltd. to supply us with the API for use in the finished Vyleesi product. In addition, in December 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Ypsomed AG to supply us with the device components of the auto-injector for use in the finished Vyleesi product. All of these agreements have certain minimum purchase requirements.
Under the Palatin License Agreement, we have exclusive rights in the Palatin Territory to a number of U.S. and foreign patents and applications related to Vyleesi that are owned by Palatin. Certain of Palatin’s patents include claims directed to the Vyleesi drug composition of matter and methods of use thereof with terms expiring in 2020, and other patents include claims directed to methods of treating FSD by subcutaneous administration of compositions that include Vyleesi with terms expiring in 2033. Any one of the issued U.S. patents may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. We have filed applications for patent term extension for two patents with terms expiring in 2020, but we have not yet received a determination from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as to whether patent term extension will be granted and, if so, the duration of such extension.
Vyleesi faces competition primarily from Addyi® (flibanserin), which was introduced into the market in October 2015 for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women and is marketed by Sprout2 Inc. We are not aware of any company actively developing another melanocortin receptor agonist drug for the treatment of HSDD. However, we are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are being developed for the treatment of HSDD that are to be taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. There may be other companies developing new drugs for FSD indications other than HSDD, which may compete with Vyleesi, some of which may be in clinical trials in the U.S. or elsewhere. Vyleesi may also compete with products prescribed “off-label” by healthcare providers. 
Vyleesi is distributed nationally through specialty pharmacies. Our marketing strategy focuses on efforts to establish Vyleesi as the preferred option for women and healthcare providers seeking a treatment for HSDD, which we implement through media such as direct-to-consumer marketing in search and social media channels. We also focus our Vyleesi marketing efforts towards healthcare professionals, who play a significant role in increasing HSDD and Vyleesi awareness among their patients. In order to minimize cost and injection barriers to treatment, we have implemented a competitive copay savings program and injection training to healthcare professionals. 
Backlog
We had a $1.8 million and $9.1 million sales backlog as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to recognize the $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, net of any applicable rebates or credits. These backlogs were largely due to timing of orders received by our third-party logistics providers. Generally, product orders from our customers are fulfilled within a relatively short time of receipt of a customer order.
Employees
As of March 2, 2020, we had 440 employees. We utilize consultants and independent contractors on a regular basis to assist in the development and commercialization of our products. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified sales, technical operations, managerial, scientific and medical personnel of all levels. Although we believe we have been relatively successful to date in obtaining and retaining such personnel, we may not be successful in the future. 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Foreign Operations
We have no foreign operations. We did not have material revenues from customers outside of the U.S. in 2019 and 2018.
