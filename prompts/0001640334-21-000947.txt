History

Following the World Trade Center attack in 2001, our former CEO, Albert Koenigsberg, used his extensive background in communication technologies and investigated additional technologies that could make the response efforts of emergency managers more streamlined. Hurricane Katrina presented many new problems for first responders, so Mr. Koenigsberg attended a series of Katrina Panel meetings to better understand the communication “gaps” that our responders identified. Following Katrina Mr. Koenigsberg decided to take a pro-active position to these gaps and started GEOcommand, Inc., a company focused on the research and development of new world technologies dedicated to the safety and security of people and the places they congregate. With the Sandy Hook School shooting, the Aurora Theater attack, the Boston Marathon bombing, the horrific events that have taken place in Paris and Orlando and the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida (which was only 10 miles from his office in Boca Raton), Mr. Koenigsberg continued to pursue the creation of an interoperable method of sharing critical in-building information with our first responders. When the Las Vegas attack during the Harvest Music Festival took place, everyone realized the problem of data sharing between our public servants needed to be solved. The current COVID- 19 Pandemic further identified the need for horizontal and vertical data sharing between hospitals and first responders worldwide.

After careful consideration and assessment of current market conditions, in lieu of investing in updating legacy GEOcommand solutions to modern technology platforms, we have decided to improve our product portfolio by developing new capabilities consistent with current technology innovations such as SaaS, Cloud, and e-commerce product delivery.

Business Overview

Maptelligent, Inc. (“Maptelligent,” “we”, “our” or “the Company”) technology serves a market of organizations and entities who are often at risk from threats and emergency incidents such as: schools, universities, hospitals, shopping malls, sporting events, commercial enterprises, and ports (sea and air), to name a few.

We provide a cloud based geographic platform to access information relevant to structures and sites enabling better emergency response to incidents occurring within buildings. 

Our solution integrates disparate data from sensors, cameras, alarms, access control and accountability systems creating actionable intelligence on an intuitive map display. This rapid access to relevant information enhances situational awareness to mitigate additional loss of life and property when shared with first responders. 

We also provide a suite of tools providing customers the ability to maintain and manage data in a mobile environment. Access to geospatial data in the cloud will provide customers to perform additional spatial analytics such as flood risk analysis, threatening weather analysis, transportation route optimization, etc. 

Mobile applications Apps provide the ability to create incident pre-plans for public safety and facility management tools for smart building management. 

We will continue to develop our in-building floorplan modeling GIS platform using the significant investment in the preparation of software solutions that has previously been made by using the ESRI software as well as our Reseller Agreement with GeoComm, Inc. GeoComm, provider of Public Safety Location Intelligence®, has a national reputation as a leading provider of public safety GIS systems. These systems route emergency calls to the appropriate 9-1-1 call center, map the caller’s location on a call taker or dispatcher map, and guide emergency responders to the scene of the accident on mobile displays within police, fire, and ambulance vehicles. Over the last 26 years, GeoComm has grown to serve local, regional, statewide, and military agencies in forty-nine states, helping keep more than 100 million people safe. In addition, in 2021 GeoComm’s statewide NG9-1-1 GIS project footprint has expanded to include seventeen statewide projects across the country. To learn more about GeoComm and our Public Safety Location Intelligence offerings visit www.geo-comm.com. 

We will continue to develop GeoComm’s in-building floorplan modeling GIS platform in coordination with ESRI software. ESRI is an international supplier of geographic information system software, web GIS and geodatabase management applications. Esri uses the name ArcGIS to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. ArcGIS also includes developer products and web services. In a general sense, the term GIS describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing decision making.

As a result of the agreement with ESRI as a Silver Partner – Value Added Reseller, we now are able to provide a multi-layer geographic information system which can serve as the common situational awareness tool for all community services, including fire, police, public works, local utility companies, community planners, and tax assessors. We intend to license our products through “White Labeling” and packaging our product offerings. These solutions can support Smart City Initiatives both large and small. Smart city initiatives are programs that use advanced technology like cameras, sensors and the Internet of Things to collect data on things like water usage, volume of traffic, electricity consumption, parking availability, waste management, the presence of pedestrians and bicyclists, and interactions between citizens and their city government. Analytics help to process and transform this data into actionable information. All products are scalable by design and encourage data sharing across multiple jurisdictions. Our technologies also encourage a public/private partnership for local, state, and national business enterprises the ability to provide the local responder agency the ability to assess an event while en route to an incident. We believe our approach will help save lives and property.

Struggling through the chaos of responding to everyday emergency calls and catastrophes like 9/11, firefighters, police, and other emergency responders were not able to access or share critical data - basic information such as building floor plans, emergency pre-plans, and responder locations. The result is a breakdown in a coordinated and efficient response.

Today, following various home-grown terrorist attacks on elementary schools, malls, and colleges the same breakdown still exists. Our. suite of technologies bridges this information gap by providing solutions that allow for a visually intuitive way for school administrators, business owners, and first responders to help save lives and property.

This set of comprehensive tools is designed for everyday use, scaling seamlessly from ordinary incidents to multi-agency mass response. Our software ensures that first responders can provide emergency services efficiently, safely, and effectively-whether it is a local or mutual aid response-without interrupting or impacting day-to-day operations.
We are dedicated to offering a scalable, cost-effective interoperability solution, providing any Smart City initiative vital information to the first responders when they need it most.

We are developing business partnerships that currently provide hardware and software solutions such as cameras, door access controls, metal detectors, AI, cloud services and other commonly used stand-alone technologies in security and situational awareness solutions. Each of these partnerships are designed to allow their existing customers the ability to seamlessly integrate with our market offerings. These relationships will allow their existing customers to create, maintain, and connect their systems of critical infrastructure in an intuitive GIS based map display and viewed by their local, regional and state emergency response agencies and personnel. We combine multiple layers of situational awareness into an extensible framework needed to fully implement emergency planning and facility/asset management goals.

Our technologies are a one-of-a-kind collaborative software system that can be used by multiple agencies and jurisdictions to plan & coordinate emergency and disaster response, management and mitigation.

Our solutions and related tools create seamless interoperability and timely distribution of information across disparate systems and platforms. We have created the tools that address the communication, collaboration and organizational challenges faced by responders during large-scale emergency events.

Whether a user is focused on a specific building and critical assets therein or looking broadly at a whole region of mutual response locations, the backbone of each aspect of operations is the GIS and the data displayed within.

Our platform will provide a common operating picture for first responders - enabling school and campus police to connect and share critical data sources in one location- specific situational awareness interface for viewing - with school administrators.

The technology will identify critical assets such as cameras, door access controls, metal detectors, panic buttons, etc., when breached. When an alarm is triggered, the map will automatically display the alarm location and any specific information the alarm is sending. In addition, the technology can interface with both indoor and outdoor shooter detection systems and biometrics (facial recognition) for a proactive response.

We provide a simple and intuitive way to view area-wide to specific in-building floor plans and critical assets as well as other areas of interest within your campus infrastructure.

Our technologies provide responding agencies with the ability to rapidly identify and share active threats and hazards (i.e., active shooter, fire, hazardous materials) - before arrival or at the scene and coordinate resources for better command and control of the event.

All our technologies have been designed by a team of passionately focused innovators. Our suite of proven tools empowers first responders to make well-informed critical decisions by providing them with key technological insights. 

REVENUE STREAM STRATEGY

The GEOcommand, Inc., business model was very heavy on PC based services, where we would go in, build a floor plan, capture attribute data, digitize it, and present it on a map. This essentially meant there is a lot of work up-front even before getting paid for the service and product.

To get around this, we are planning on partnering with strategic business partners so we can offer a low-cost/low-touch solutions within our buying experience such as that associated with SaaS. This can be implemented by simply directing the customer to www.maptelligent.com as they subscribe to our map conversion and data sharing service between their infrastructure and their first responders.

To create an effective buyer experience, a strategy to implement four interwoven revenue streams will provide a low cost/low touch entry point to work with us and provide customers with options as their needs grow.

The four revenue streams are as follows:


1. | SaaS (recurring subscription for a hosted solution) 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------
2. | Content Management Solutions 
3. | Products/Solutions (apps, software, and hardware per user)
4. | Professional Services (ProServ) (time, material, expenses)

Maptelligent SaaS

The SaaS model is a multi-tenant hosted solution to be used by all customer stakeholders to view and share information. Feature/functionality is extended and complemented through selling Products and Solutions. For example: Customized ArcGIS Collector App for building engineers to maintain building attributes and setup maintenance schedules. An App for teachers to initiate an emergency alert and provide location and status of each student.

SaaS is strategic to our future business because SaaS is the direction the market is moving toward in solution buying. SaaS offers customers a streamlined method to acquire new technology and shortens the sales cycle and increases profit margins through lower cost of sales.

Content Management

Today’s IT market is rapidly moving to the cloud. The cloud is a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are linked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem. These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable devices making the information available anywhere. Many companies and organizations are choosing the cloud as a cost-effective means of storing large volumes of data and information. The cloud affords organizations the ability to address and access their data storage needs rapidly and securely while only paying for what they use. This cloud utility model is a fundamental change from the legacy private data centers. 

We provide customers with a cloud content management solution to store and manage data associated with the security solutions we provide.

Products/Solutions (Maps and Apps)

As mentioned above, the product/solution revenue stream is associated with complementing and extending the SaaS product with a series of stand-alone maps and apps that will support the hosted solution with specific use cases such as building maintenance, fire department preplanning and risk analysis, and law enforcement tactical response planning and execution.

The types of maps we can provide would be proprietary content and shareable with the customer for an additional subscription fee. Customers can select map layers from a catalog of map services to use within their own map.

Professional Services

ProServ is our core business and distinctive competence and will provide work engagements for our implementation and project team. It should complement our overall solution offering but not be the leading driver of how we first engage with a customer. With that in mind, how we get building plans into the map can be as simple as adding a PDF to get the customer started, or for an additional cost, we do a complete and thorough review and assessment of the customer facility. ProServ will be our upsell, not the initial sell.

1. | We build and map high-fidelity floor plans including collecting attribute data. Our target market is school safety and physical security for critical infrastructure and large campus facilities 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A SaaS solution for organizations interested in mapping building floor plans to facilitate a better public safety response to emergency incidents at the location 
3. | We plan to utilize hosted SaaS solutions (Partner Companies) as a platform to sell to our customers for low-fidelity building plan mapping 
4. | We propose our organization creates an organization instance on Partner Company’s SaaS solutions 
5. | We will provide our own user provisioning to collect customer information and subscriptions 
6. | We will share the revenue collected with Partner Companies 
7. | We intend to use the Partner Company’s solutions as a means to facilitate a low-touch entry into mapping for schools, hospitals, and enterprises interested in providing better security of their facilities through first responders having access to information
8. | We intend to establish a proprietary content management solution for its customers to use 
9. | We will provide/share content (high-fidelity floor plans, etc.) we collect via the Partner Company’s SaaS interface so that dispatch centers, and first responders as part of the relationship with Partner Companies. 
10. | Ultimately Maptelligent, Inc., and various Partner Companies would collaborate on opportunities to drive solution utilization 

SALES & MARKETING PLAN

We are on a mission to enhance physical security of structures where large gatherings of people can be found such as, schools, universities, hospitals, sports venues, shopping malls, corporate campuses, etc. Through the use of geospatial technology, we are transforming the way data and information is accessed during a time of crisis by those who need it most...first responders. Our solution integrates disparate data from sensors, cameras, alarms, access control, accountability systems and many other sources to create actionable intelligence by presenting their location within a building and by visualizing the data/information they provide on an intuitive map interface.

We provide a geographic platform for first responders to access site-specific information enhancing situational awareness while en route and upon arrival at the incident scene. This quick access to relevant information shortens the time it takes for tactical action by allowing advanced arrival planning, thereby mitigating additional life and property threat exposure.

Our geocentric system serves as a common operational picture for all stakeholders involved in maintaining and protecting physical structures and venues. Through potential partnerships with industry leaders in physical security technology, Maptelligent, Inc., solutions act as the data integration platform for visualizing information produced by partners technologies.

Our solution serves a large market of organizations and entities who are often at risk from threats and emergency incidents such as: schools, universities, hospitals, shopping malls, sporting events, commercial enterprises, ports (sea and air), to name a few markets.

Our customers begin their solution journey by uploading a building floor plan via a PDF file to a hosted solution in the cloud. This low-touch/low-cost solution allows users to quickly share site-specific details with public safety.

Our customers seeking to share additional relevant information and data are able to use Maptelligent, Inc., content management cloud services making it accessible anywhere on any device with permission.

We offer a suite of maps and apps providing customers the ability to maintain and manage data in a mobile environment for public safety to create incident preplans associated with the building floor plan and for building engineers to manage maintenance schedules for critical elements of a building such as alarm panels, pull stations, extinguishers, and other assets which need regular attention.

We offer customers with Professional Services (ProServ) to build high fidelity floor plans, safety assessments, and system integration services making the whole system complete and comprehensive.

We have developed our sales plan to maximize our product’s market penetration and revenue potential. We intend to promote sales through a combination of in-house efforts, strategic partnerships, license arrangements and reseller agreements.

To date we have primarily been focused on research, development and field testing. Having an abundance of ambition, we have delivered multiple proofs of concept, despite a limited funding. In order to have a successful rollout of products, the company aims to be in the position to hire experienced sales managers and account executives to sell to both the public and private markets. 

We believe we represent the only community solution that addresses all four pillars of preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery in a single application. Our software will integrate fire, police, EMS (Emergency Medical Services), and private and municipal assets into a single common operating picture. Our platform allows for authentication of each end user’s data input across multi-disciplinary and interagency activities. This allows various administrative users the ability to update data on a near real-time basis, allowing for a free flow of updates from authorized administrators to end users responding to an incident.

All emergencies start at a local level. These emergencies may escalate and involve multiple community agencies, multiple jurisdictions, and sometimes even to the point of a federal response. Our suite of software focuses on both pre-incident planning and enhanced data handling during response and mitigation. Our software will allow for complete horizontal and vertical data sharing, providing a common operating picture for all agencies from the fire and police chief, to the mayor, state agencies, and federal authorities.

Our development considers the needs of emergency and public safety responders as well as the needs of the building owners to form a unique public and private partnership for community preparedness. We believe our suite of products distinguishes us from our competitors by providing detailed and interactive site-specific data. We address a critical need: a public/private partnership for the sharing of pertinent data both horizontally and vertically without undue burden on existing agency resources.

THE MARKETS

The safety and security of people and places extends to many vertical markets because the value of emergency planning is not limited to first responders themselves. The same concepts apply to other types of organizations, such as:

· | School Districts 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Colleges and Universities 
· | Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Assisted Living 
· | Hotels and Casinos 
· | Airports and Seaports 
· | Government Buildings (Courthouse complexes, DMV, Internal revenue, and more) 
· | Theaters and Cineplexes 
· | Large Commercial Property Owners and Management Companies 
· | Safe/Smart City Projects 
· | Oil & Gas Companies 
· | Telecommunication Companies 
· | Sport Venues 
· | Global corporations with widespread facilities and critical assets. e.g. retail stores, restaurant chains, manufacturers, industrial parks, to name a few examples.

Current Business Partnerships/Sales

Esri Business Partner: We are currently a Silver Business Partner with Esri, whose geographic software engine is the core of our GIS interface. This relationship should boost our marketing and sales substantially, as we will be providing a robust product for public safety, and Esri is the de facto in public safety mapping worldwide.

The Company has been developing strategic partnerships. Our objective is to introduce us to well established distribution outlets and technology partners. These strategic partnerships will build awareness about our products, generate significant sales, and will allow the company to focus on technology development. Today the company is involved in working with several strategic partners.

Competition

While we believe that we provide a unique software solution for use by first responders, we will face intense competition from other companies that engage or may engage in providing computer software and related technology to assist first responders.

Many of these competitors have been in existence for a considerable period of time, have substantially greater resources than we do and have developed relationships with regulators and government officials that may facilitate their ability to attract government contracts to their companies rather than ours.

Seasonality

We do not expect any seasonality in our business.

Employees

Other than our Officers and Directors we have three full-time and no part-time employees. We anticipate adding additional employees in the next 12 months, as needed. We do not feel that we would have any unmanageable difficulty in locating qualified staff.
Intellectual Property

In the future, we may rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.

We plan to have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.

Settlement with GEOcommand

On March 31, 2021, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Agreement”), GEOcommand, Inc. (“GEOcommand”) and Albert Koenigsberg (together with GEOcommand, the “Releasors”). On April 13, 2020, the Company, under its former name, as Las Vegas Xpress, Inc., entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with GEOcommand to acquire certain assets of GEOcommand (the “APA”). Under the Agreement, the Company agreed to release and relinquish any claims against the Releasors over certain assets subject to the APA, in exchange for the Releasors releasing the Company from certain potential claims related to the APA, including its obligation to acquire GEOcommand and its software. The Agreement also contained certain mutual releases, covenants and representations from both parties to the Agreement.
