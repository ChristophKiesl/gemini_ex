Corporate History and General Business Development
 
Agritek Holdings, Inc. (referred to hereafter as “AGTK,” or, the “Company”), was initially incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1997 under the name Easy Street Online, Inc.
 
In 1997, the Company changed its name to Frontline Communications Corp. (“Frontline”) and operated as a regional Internet service provider (“ISP”) providing Internet access, web hosting, website design, and related services to residential and small business customers throughout the Northeast United States and, through a network partnership agreement providing Internet access to customers nationwide.
 
On April 3, 2003, the Company acquired Proyecciones y Ventas Organizadas, S.A. de C.V. (“Provo Mexico”) and in December 2003 the Company changed the name to Provo International Inc. (“Provo”).
 
In 2008, Provo changed its name to Ebenefits Direct, Inc., which, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, L.A. Marketing Plans, LLC, engaged in the business of direct response marketing. The Company’s principal business was to market and sell non-insurance healthcare programs designed to complement medical insurance products and to provide savings for those who cannot afford or qualify for traditional health insurance products.
 
On October 14, 2008, Ebenefits Direct, Inc. changed its name to Seraph Security, Inc. (“Seraph”).
 
On April 25, 2009, Seraph acquired Commerce Online Technologies, Inc., a credit and debit card processing company.
 
On May 20, 2009, Seraph Security, Inc. changed its name to Commerce Online, Inc. to more accurately reflect its core business of merchant processing, and financial services.
 
As of February 18, 2010, Commerce Online, Inc. changed its name to Cannabis Medical Solutions, Inc. (“CMSI”) as a provider of merchant processing payment technologies for the medical marijuana and wellness sector.
 
On March 8, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of 800 Commerce, Inc. (“800 Commerce”) a Florida Corporation incorporated by the Company’s then Chief Executive Officer.

Description of Business
 
Agritek Holdings, Inc. together with its subsidiaries collectively (“the Company” or “Agritek Holdings”) is a public company incorporated pursuant to the laws of the state of Delaware and quoted on the OTC Markets Pink Tier under the symbol “AGTK”. Our corporate headquarters is located at 777 Brickell Avenue Suite 500, Miami, Fl. 33131 and our telephone number is (305) 721.2727. Our website address is as follows: www.agritekholdings.com. Information available on or accessible through our websites is not a part of and shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
Agritek Holdings is a fully integrated, active investor and operator in the legal cannabis sector. Specifically, Agritek Holdings provides strategic capital and functional expertise seeking to accelerate the commercialization of its diversified portfolio of holdings. The Company is focused on three high-value segments of the cannabis market, including real estate investment, intellectual property brands; and infrastructure, with operations in U.S. States, including Florida, Colorado and California. Agritek Holdings invests its capital via real estate holdings, licensing agreements, royalties and equity in acquisition operations.
 
We intend to provide key business services to the legal cannabis sector including:
 

• | Funding and Financing Solutions for Agricultural Land and Properties zoned for the regulated Cannabis Industry; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Dispensary and Retail Solutions; 
• | Commercial Production and Equipment Build Out Solutions; 
• | Multichannel Supply Chain Solutions; 
• | Branding, Marketing and Sales Solutions of proprietary product lines; and 
• | Consumer Product Solutions. 

 
The Company intends to bring its’ array of services to each new state that legalizes the use of cannabis according to appropriate state and federal laws. Our primary objective is acquiring commercial properties to be utilized in the commercial marijuana industry as cultivation facilities in compliance with state laws. This is an essential aspect of our overall growth strategy because once acquired and re-zoned, the value of such real property is substantially higher than under the previous zoning and use.
 
Once properties are identified and acquired to be used for purposes related to the commercial marijuana industry as provided for by state law, we plan to create vertical channels within that legal jurisdiction including equipment financing, payment processing and marketing of exclusive brands and services to retail dispensaries.
 
The Company’s business focus is primarily to hold, develop and manage real property. The Company shall also provide oversight on every property that is part of its portfolio. This can include complete architectural design and subsequent build-outs, general support, landscaping, general up-keep, and state of the art security systems.
 
At this time, the Company does not grow, process, own, handle, transport, or sell marijuana as the Company is organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws. As the legal environment changes in Colorado, California and other states, the Company’s management may explore business opportunities that involve ownership interests in dispensaries and growing operations if and when such business opportunities become legally permissible under applicable state and federal laws.
 
The Company also owns several Hemp and cannabis brands for distribution including "Hemp Pops", “MD Vapes”, “Rehab Rx”, “Higher Society” and "California Premiums". Agritek Holdings, Inc. does not directly grow, harvest, or distribute or sell cannabis or any substances that violate or contravene United States law or the Controlled Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the future. 
 
Through its vertically integrated business model, the Company also strives to produce, brand and distribute hemp based products to improve customers’ lives and meet their demands for stringent product quality, efficacy and consistency. The Company does not produce or sell medicinal or recreational marijuana or products derived therefrom. The Company’s hemp products are made from high quality strains of whole-plant hemp extracts containing a broad spectrum of phytocannabinoids, including CBD, CBN, CBN terpenes, flavonoids and other minor but valuable hemp compounds. The Company believes the presence of these various compounds work synergistically to heighten the effects of the products, making them superior to single-compound CBD isolates. The Company’s hemp extracts are produced from hemp, which is defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta9 tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. THC causes psychoactive effects when consumed and is typically associated with marijuana (i.e. Cannabis with high-THC content). The Company does not produce or sell medicinal or recreational marijuana or products derived from high-THC Cannabis/marijuana plants. Hemp products have no psychoactive effects. 
 
Our operations include a portfolio of wholly owned and licensed brands that cover high growth segments of the cannabis sector including CBD edibles and topicals under our newly acquired Rehab Rx brand. Present and future brand launches are planned to be offered by a strong in-house team complemented by independent advisors with the objective of assisting clients and partners in accelerating the commercialization of their product(s) or services, and ultimately in leveraging their unique selling proposition to create a leadership position in their chosen niche within the global cannabis industry. The Company’s current product categories include human ingestible (tinctures, capsules, and gummies), topicals, and pet products. Planned product categories, as or when approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) include powdered supplements, beverage, food, beauty, sport, professional (dedicated health care practitioner products) and over-the-counter wellness. The Company’s products are distributed through its ecommerce websites RehabRx.com, Hemppops.com and third party ecommerce websites including Amazon, select distributors and a variety of brick and mortar retailers. The Company sources high-quality hemp through long term contract farming operations in Colorado and California.

We also have a “rollup” growth strategy, which includes the following components:
 

· | With our brand recognition and experienced management team, maximize productivity, provide economies of scale, and increase profitability through our public market vehicle;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire unique products and niche players where barriers to entry are high and margins are robust, providing them clients a broader outlet for their products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop and acquire multiple cannabis brands to capture the market vertically from manufacturing to production up to retail.

Going concern
 
As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had net loss of $8,045,888 and $1,412,278 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net cash used in operations were $1,448,001 and $1,260,492 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $35,036,243 and $26,990,355 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, had a working capital deficit of $5,355,872 at December 31, 2019, had no revenues from operations in 2019 and 2018 and we defaulted on our debt. Management believes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report.
 
Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that our capital resources are not currently adequate to continue operating and maintaining its business strategy for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The Company will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future.
 
Although the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail or cease operations.
 
Recent Developments
 
Currently, we are exploring strategic alternatives for certain operational and non-operational assets in both Colorado and California as well as in Canada. We’re working with financial advisors to identify locations or permits that we believe can generate non-dilutive capital that can be reinvested in strategic locations to produce greater returns. We have identified multiple opportunities that we believe to be a more accretive use of capital. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our exploration of strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.
 
On March 3, 2019, the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, with the Delaware Secretary of State, to increase its authorized common stock from 1,250,000,000 shares to 1,499,000,000 shares. The Company’s 1,500,000,000 authorized shares consisted of 1,499,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.
 
On March 26, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective in the stock market upon commencement of trading on March 26, 2019. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every two-hundred shares of our Pre-Reverse Stock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of two-hundred as of March 26, 2019. All historical share and per share amounts reflected throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The authorized number of shares and the par value per share of our common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. 
 
Share Exchange Agreement with Full Spectrum Biosciences, Inc.
 
On March 9, 2020, the Company and Full Spectrum Bioscience, Inc., (“FSB”), a private corporation and a related party, incorporated in Colorado on December 11, 2018 (collectively as “Parties”), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) to acquire 100% of controlling interest in FSB. On March 31, 2020, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company issued to 10,000,000 shares of its common stock to FSB in exchange for 1,500 shares of FSB common stock which constitutes all of FSB’s authorized and outstanding common stock held by a sole stockholder. At the time of the Exchange Agreement FSB was owned by the spouse of our Interim Chief Executive Officer.

On May 5, 2020, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with a lender, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of up to $565,556 (“May 2020 Note”) to be funded in several tranches, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the May 2020 Note and five-year warrants (the “May 2020 Warrants”) to purchase up to 10,282,828 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to 110% of the VWAP of the common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the funding date of the respective tranche, (subject to adjustments under certain conditions as defined in the May 2020 Warrants). The May 2020 Note accrues interest at a rate of 9% per year (which shall be increased to 18% per year upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the May 2020 Note).

The maturity date of each tranche funded shall be six months from the effective date of each tranche. The lender has the right at any time to convert all or any part of the funded portion of the May 2020 Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 58% of the lowest trading price during the twenty-five trading day period ending on either (i) the last complete trading day prior to the conversion date or (ii) the conversion date (subject to adjustment as provided in the May 2020 Note), at the Lender’s sole discretion.

Industry Overview
 
The Company is not engaged in the direct growth, cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis. However, we do offer consulting services to licensed operators and applicants for state offered cannabis licenses, who seek to engage in the medical and/or recreational cannabis business in those state jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized. We also sell ancillary products and own trademarked brands which are used in the legalized cannabis industry.
 
As of the date of this filing, thirty-four (34) states and the District of Columbia currently have laws broadly legalizing cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis is a “Schedule 1” drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”) and is illegal under federal law.
 
On August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The “Cole Memorandum” provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.
 
On January 4, 2018, then Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 “Cole Memorandum”.
 
In rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.

On March 23, 2018, then President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis.”
 
On December 20, 2018, then President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and was illegal under the federal CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under the CSA and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 
The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 
On November 1, 2019, Colorado Bill HB-19-1090, was passed and made effective. This law allows publicly traded corporations to apply for and qualify for the ownership of Colorado cannabis licenses. Other states that have legalized cannabis for recreational and/or medicinal use restrict public companies from owning interests in state cannabis licenses altogether, or have enacted regulations which make it difficult for corporations to comply with application requirements, including all shareholders submitting to and passing background checks.
 
We at times that seem prudent seek to acquire minority equity ownership in development stage businesses that our cannabis licensee applicants intend to operate, where not precluded by state laws. In exchange for a reduced fee for consulting services, we negotiate for minority equity positions in applicant corporations, or minority interests in applicant limited liability companies, with the contingent expectations that if a license is awarded, and the licensee obtains funding and commences operations, the Company may share in those profits and losses.

Real Estate and Construction Operations
 
The Company holds equity interest in real property in Pueblo, Colorado which is approved for a cultivation operation for Hemp once we have completed a settlement agreement and payment for water and mineral rights.
 
Agritek Holdings intends to build on its existing relationships by developing operating plans and providing oversight, strategy and management of the business units’ growth and integration. Further, Agritek Holdings plans to continue expanding its reach by building new partnerships with vertical market partners and end-user products companies as well as exploring opportunities with successful cultivators and processors. Through its expansion efforts, Agritek Holdings intends to utilize online sales and marketing platforms, participate in relevant trade shows and develop various advertising materials to communicate its multiple licensed brands including “RehabRx”, “MD Vapes” “California Premiums”, “Hemp Pops” and additional CBD products.
 
We believe that Agritek Holdings is also well-positioned to participate in the large and growing legal cannabis market for enhanced downstream cannabis products and new products with various consumer and medical applications.
 
Agritek Holdings focuses on the growth of its business units and expanding their reach to end-users and partners. Although the business units are primarily responsible for developing and operating their respective businesses, the Company is available to provide functional expertise, financing, oversight and a framework of disciplined planning to the operations of the business units when needed.
 
Agritek Holdings’ short-term objective is to create a sustainable business in the key states of California, Colorado as well as in Canada and Puerto Rico by integrating its holdings to create synergies and true end-to-end solutions geared to the needs of patients and consumers. Agritek Holdings has positioned itself for commercial growth by focusing its expanded resource base on finding and partnering with the best and most innovative companies, projects, assets and overall business frameworks in the legal cannabis sector in the aforementioned jurisdictions.
 
To achieve its objectives, the Company seeks to continue making specific and deliberate investments, including acquisitions, to:
 

1. | Increase the diversity and quality of the Company’s product offerings across different market segments; and 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Increase the strength and segmentation of the Company’s diversified portfolio of real estate holdings and product brands.

 
In addition, management believes that significant opportunities exist today and will develop further in the future, to leverage the Company’s expertise, financial strength and business model in legal cannabis markets around the world. Agritek Holdings intends on pursuing opportunities in a number of jurisdictions where cannabis use is legal, and/or where governments are actively pursuing legalization.
 
Subject to legislative and regulatory compliance, strategic business opportunities pursued by the Company could include:
 

1. | Providing advisory services to third-parties that are interested in establishing licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and sales operations;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Entering into strategic relationships that create value by sharing expertise and industry knowledge; 
3. | Providing capital in the form of debt, royalties, or equity to new business units; and

Services and Markets
 
To date, we have invested and been successful in receiving approval for licenses on behalf of multiple manufacturing and cultivation service contracts in areas which include the state of Colorado, California and the territory of Puerto Rico.
Funding and Financing Solutions
 
Our goal is to become the funding and financing service partner of choice in the legal Colorado and California cannabis market before expanding nationwide if and when applicable state and federal law allows us to do so. We offer financing and financial aid to cultivators, collectives, dispensaries and product businesses in the legal cannabis industry with alternative funding and financing solutions. In the evolving legal cannabis industry, where traditional banking opportunities are grossly limited, we step in to provide the “traditional” bank lending services; lines of credit, property financing, and/or commercial loans. Businesses and individuals seeking funding and financing solutions are qualified and scored based on their experience, current operations, financial records, and compliance grades given by our proprietary banking partners and credit lines that comply with all state governance rules.
Finance and Real Estate
 
Real Estate Leasing
 
Our real estate leasing business primarily includes the acquisition and leasing of manufacturing and cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. Management anticipates that these facilities will range in size from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet. These facilities will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate our tenants’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
As of the date of this report, we have a prior investment interest in one cultivation property that is located in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado (the “Pueblo West Property”). The property consists of approximately eighty (80) acres of land. The property is currently zoned for cultivating cannabis and we are currently evaluating strategic options for this property.
 
Canada
 
We maintain a management contract with a “420” style proposed bed and breakfast property located in Quebec, Canada. Agritek Holdings is entitled to all rental revenue from vacation stays and sale of hemp based products generated from the property.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries which we operate:
 
Range of Services. We are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver a comprehensive, integrated solution to companies in the cannabis industry – from operational and compliance consulting to security and marketing to financing needs.
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to rapid growth through acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy in pursuing these alliances are based on the target’s ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs, and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
Industry Breadth. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance our industry breadth.
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our services and products throughout the United States in states that have implemented regulated cannabis programs as well as Canada. We intend to expand our offerings as more new countries, states and jurisdictions as they adopt state-regulated or Federal programs.

Intellectual Property
 
On November 17, 2016, we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) a federal trademark registration for “Hemp Pops” in the category of Staple Food Products. We also have pending trademark applications pending to protect our branding and logos. These pending applications included trademarks for Rehab Rx (stylized and/or with design logo).
Competition
 
Our competitors include professional services firms dedicated to the regulated cannabis and hemp industries, as well as suppliers of equipment and supplies commonly utilized in the cultivation, processing, or retail sale of cannabis and hemp. We compete in markets where cannabis and hemp has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States, it’s territories and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the cannabis and hemp industries mature. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience and success to date, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our operations and results.
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that provide similar products and/or services, such as direct finance, leasing of real estate, including shared workspace, warehouse sales, and consulting services to the cannabis industry. In the future we fully expect that other companies will recognize the value of ancillary businesses serving the cannabis industry and enter into the marketplace as competitors.
 
The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation propounded on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants.
 
Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified underwriters, investment banking partners and loan managers, consultants and advisors with industry depth, and talented managerial, operational and other personnel. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to develop and acquire effective proprietary products and solutions, personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We expect to compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, and ease of use of our services.
 
FinCEN
 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidance on February 14, 2014 about how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a “financial institution” includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:
 

• | Bank (except bank credit card systems); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Broker or dealer in securities; 
• | Money services business; 
• | Telegraph company; 
• | Casino; 
• | Card club; and 
• | A person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority. 

 
In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.
 
In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.

As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement’s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports.
 
While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in. We realize that there is a discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities. The CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this filing, thirty-four (34) states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabis-related activity.
 
Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we have 2 full-time employees, all of whom are U.S based, primarily in Florida at our headquarters. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
