ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
MBI is a preclinical-stage pharmaceutical company organized as a Delaware corporation in July 2015 to focus on the development of anti-cancer drug candidates, some of which are based on license agreements with The University of Texas System on behalf of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which we refer to as MD Anderson. Our lead drug candidate is liposomal Annamycin, which we refer to as Annamycin, an anthracycline being studied for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. Annamycin has been in clinical trials pursuant to an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, that had been filed with the FDA. Due to a lack of development activity by a prior drug developer, this IND was terminated. To permit the renewed investigation of Annamycin, we are submitting a new IND augmenting the data that supported the original IND, with subsequent clinical data and additional information. We have two other drug development projects in process, one involving a collection of small molecules, which we refer to as the WP1066 Portfolio, focused on the modulation of key regulatory transcription factors involved in the progression of cancer, and the WP1222 Portfolio, a suite of molecules targeting the metabolic processes involved in cancer in general and glioblastoma (the most common form of brain tumor) in particular. We also continue to sponsor ongoing research at MD Anderson in order to improve and expand our drug development pipeline.
 
We have been granted royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive licenses for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1066 Portfolio and WP1122 Portfolio drug technologies, as these patent rights are owned by MD Anderson. The Annamycin drug substance is no longer covered by any existing patent protection. We intend to submit patent applications for formulation, synthetic process and reconstitution related to our Annamycin drug product candidate, although there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such patent protection. Independently from potential patent protection, we have received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for Annamycin for the treatment of AML, which would entitle us to market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the United States. If we submit and receive approval for a New Drug Application (NDA) for Annamycin for the treatment of AML, we may then benefit from Orphan Drug exclusivity, during which period FDA generally could not approve another Annamycin product for the same use. We also intend to apply for similar status in the European Union (EU) where market exclusivity extends to 10 years from the date of Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). Separately, the FDA may also grant market exclusivity of 5 years for newly approved new chemical entities (of which Annamycin would be one), but there can be no assurance that such exclusivity will be granted.

Corporate History
 
We were founded in 2015 by Walter Klemp (our chairman and CEO), Dr. Don Picker (our President and Chief Operating Officer) and Dr. Waldemar Priebe of MD Anderson (Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board) in order to combine and consolidate development efforts that include several MD Anderson anti-cancer technologies. This effort began with the acquisition of the Annamycin development project from AnnaMed, Inc., or AnnaMed, followed by the acquisition of the license rights to the WP1122 Portfolio from IntertechBio Corporation, or IntertechBio. Further, we undertook an effort to gain control of the WP1066 Portfolio, which culminated with the merger of Moleculin, LLC and MBI and the establishment of a co-development agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or HPI, coincident with our IPO.
 
AnnaMed was formed in 2012 to take over the development of Annamycin from a prior drug development company, Callisto Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Callisto. Callisto ceased development work on Annamycin, leading to the termination of its IND by the FDA. Callisto disclosed publicly in its Form 10-K filing for the year ended 2009 that the clinical data relating to acute leukemia patients “did not support further clinical evaluation of L-Annamycin as a single agent to treat relapsed or refractory adult acute leukemia patients.” In order to satisfy unmet license obligations, Callisto agreed to transfer all available Annamycin data to AnnaMed, which data we are using and have augmented with additional data and information to apply for a new IND. As such, notwithstanding Callisto’s determination to terminate its development of Annamycin, we are utilizing the clinical data from Callisto’s trials to apply for a new IND. The basis for our decision to proceed notwithstanding Callisto’s determination is that we believe the actual clinical data as reported by Dr. Robert Shepard, our Chief Medical Officer and who was Callisto’s Chief Medical Officer at the time of the clinical trials, to the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and as further reported by the Principal Investigators of the clinical trials in a peer-reviewed journal article (Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 August; 13(4): 430–434. doi:10.1016/j.clml.2013.03.015.), supports further clinical evaluation. In addition, the conclusion published in the 2013 Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia journal article was that “Single agent nanomolecular liposomal annamycin appears to be well-tolerated and evidence of clinical activity as a single agent in refractory adult ALL.” As reported in both the ASCO presentation and the 2013 journal article referenced, the definition of efficacy is based on the following Response Criteria: “Response criteria were achievement of CR defined as ≤5% blasts, granulocyte count of ≥1×109/L, and a platelet count of ≥100×109/L. Partial remission was defined the same as CR, except for the presence of 6% to 25% blasts. Hematologic improvement was defined as for CR but platelet count <100×109/L.” The summary of patient response from the 2013 journal article reads: “After determining the MTD, a 10-patient phase IIA was conducted. Eight of the patients completed one cycle of the three days of treatment at the MTD. Of these, five (62%) demonstrated encouraging anti-leukemic activity with complete clearing of circulating peripheral blasts. Three of these subjects also cleared bone marrow blasts with one subsequently proceeding onto successful stem cell transplantation. The other two developed tumor lysis syndrome and unfortunately expired prior to response assessment.” In the Company’s review of these trials, it confirmed that the activity demonstrated in this summary corresponds with a “Partial remission” as described in the Response Criteria and that the three subjects who “cleared bone marrow blasts” correspond with “CR” (Complete Response).
 
In 2012, AnnaMed out-licensed development rights in a limited territory to a Polish special purpose drug development company called Dermin in exchange for Dermin’s development work based on its successful effort to obtain Polish government grant funding to assist in the development of Annamycin. Since that time, such grant funding has been used to produce Annamycin in preparation for future clinical trials. In August 2015, we entered into a rights transfer agreement with AnnaMed pursuant to which, in exchange for 1,431,000 shares of our common stock, AnnaMed agreed to transfer any and all data it had regarding the development of Annamycin and the Annamycin IND, including all trade secrets, know-how, confidential information and other intellectual property rights held by AnnaMed.
 
IntertechBio was formed in 2009 to license and begin development on the WP1122 Portfolio. The WP1122 Portfolio was also out-licensed to Dermin, which was awarded a Polish government grant to assist in drug development efforts. In August 2015, IntertechBio agreed to assign all license rights to us in exchange for our common stock.

Moleculin, LLC was formed in 2006 and has been working to develop the WP1066 Portfolio it licensed from MD Anderson. As a part of the formation of Moleculin, LLC, an agreement was reached with HPI to limit Moleculin, LLC’s development efforts to uses in dermatology only, leaving non-dermatology indications to HPI. From 2006 to 2014, Moleculin, LLC funded its operations through the sale of equity and debt securities and through fees received from an out-licensing agreement with a Japanese dermatology drug development company, Maruho, Ltd., or Maruho. Beginning in 2012, Moleculin, LLC conducted a series of clinical trials focused on the topical treatment of psoriasis. Although those trials demonstrated drug activity, the results were not conclusive enough to warrant full commercialization as a topical dermatology drug. Additional study was required to determine optimal dosing and scheduling regimens for the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques. As a result of this additional complexity with regard to the potential treatment of psoriasis, Maruho did not elect to continue its funding of the psoriasis drug development effort and, therefore, forfeited their license rights to the WP1066 Portfolio that had been granted to it by Moleculin, LLC. Dermin is planning to clinically evaluate a candidate from the WP1066 Portfolio for the topical treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. We do not have control of the clinical plan or timeline for Dermin’s development effort.
 
Prior to our IPO, Moleculin, LLC was merged with and into our company. The merger agreement contains mutual representations and warranties between the parties. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we agreed for a period of six years to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and/or officer of Moleculin, LLC whom Moleculin, LLC would have had the power to indemnify under Delaware law that is made a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceeding or claim by reason of the fact that he or she was a director or officer of the Moleculin, LLC prior to the effective time of the merger and arising out of actions or omissions of the indemnified party in any such capacity occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger against any losses or damages reasonably incurred in connection with any claim. To our knowledge, no such proceeding or claim exists or has been threatened on the date hereof and Moleculin, LLC made representations to this effect in the merger agreement as of the date of such agreement. As additional consideration payable to the Moleculin, LLC unit holders, we agreed pursuant to the merger agreement that if drugs for dermatology indications are successfully developed by us (or our successors) using any of the Existing IP Assets, then the Moleculin, LLC unit holders, in the aggregate, will be entitled to receive a 2.5% royalty on the net revenues generated by such drugs. Any such net revenues would include a deduction for license fees or royalty obligations payable to MD Anderson for such Existing IP Assets. The merger agreement defined “Existing IP Assets” to mean all intellectual property, licensed by us and Moleculin, LLC as of the time of the merger, including, without limitation, the intellectual property licensed from MD Anderson under the Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between IntertechBio Corporation and MD Anderson dated April 2, 2012, as amended, and the Patent and Technology License Agreement dated June 21, 2010, as amended, between MD Anderson and Moleculin, LLC, but excluding any intellectual property relating to Annamycin. The right to receive the contingent royalty payments described herein are for drugs developed only for dermatology indications, and do not include drugs developed for any other indications. We have no obligation of any nature to pursue the development of any drugs for dermatology indications.
 
From 2006 through 2015, HPI was engaged in research related to the use of the WP1066 Portfolio for the treatment of non-dermatology cancers and received grant awards totaling approximately $4.9 million toward this effort. Prior to our IPO, we entered into a co-development agreement with HPI whereby HPI is continuing its grant-funded research and making all resulting data available for our use in exchange for a development fee. We may buy HPI out of its co-development rights in the WP1066 Portfolio at our option. Please see the section “Business – License Agreements” for a description of our agreement with HPI.
 
Neither our founders nor MBI have or will have any ownership stake in Dermin, our Polish licensee. No Dermin-related grant money is expected to be paid directly to us, but rather the sublicense agreements require Dermin to share resulting data, which we believe will reduce costs we might otherwise have to incur directly. There can be no assurance, however, that Dermin will continue to receive the funds they have been awarded or that such funds will be spent by Dermin in a manner that will benefit MBI. The sublicensed territories granted to Dermin for the WP1066 Portfolio are Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. For the WP1122 Portfolio, the territory expanded to include Russia and Kazakhstan. For Annamycin, the territory is further expanded to include Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Greece, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Iceland, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Germany. However, in the case of Germany, this territory may be reclaimed by us for a payment of $500,000 to Dermin.

Our Drug Candidates
 
Annamycin
 
Our lead product candidate is Annamycin, for which FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of AML. We intend to conduct clinical trials for Annamycin as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. If Annamycin is ultimately approved on this basis, it is possible, with the necessary subsequent testing and approval, that it could be used in the future in combination with other drugs.
Market for Annamycin
 
Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and acute forms of leukemia can manifest quickly and leave patients with limited treatment options. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. It occurs when a clone of leukemic progenitor white blood cells proliferates in the bone marrow, suppressing the production of normal blood cells. Currently, the only viable option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant, which is successful in a significant number of patients. However, in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, the patient’s leukemia cells must be decreased to a sufficiently low level. This usually begins with a therapy of combining two chemotherapeutic drugs, which almost always includes an anthracycline to induce remission (a complete response, or CR). This therapy has not improved since it was first used in the 1970s and we estimate that this induction therapy has a success rate of about 20%, as it has from the time of its initial use. Unfortunately, the current clinically approved anthracyclines are cardiotoxic (i.e., can damage the heart), which can limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients. Additionally, the tumor cells often present de novo or develop resistance to the first line anthracycline, through what is called “multidrug resistance,” enabling the tumor cells to purge themselves of the available anthracyclines. Consequently, there remains no effective therapy for inducing remission in these patients sufficient to enable a curative bone marrow transplant and unfortunately most will succumb quickly to their leukemia. If a patient’s leukemia reappears before they can be prepared for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to have “relapsed.” If a patient fails to achieve a sufficient response from the induction therapy to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to be “refractory” (resistant to therapy). Together, this group of relapsed and refractory AML patients constitutes our primary focus for treatment with Annamycin and our intent is to pursue FDA approval for Annamycin as a second-line induction therapy for adult relapsed and refractory AML patients.

We believe that pursuing approval as a second line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients is the shortest path to regulatory approval, but we also believe that one of the most important potential uses of Annamycin is in the treatment of children with either AML or ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is more common in children). Accordingly, we also intend to pursue approval for pediatric use in these conditions when practicable.


Of the estimated 18,860 U.S. cases of acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed in 2014, an estimated 97% were adult and although exact numbers are not available, we estimate that 70% to 80% (approximately 13,000 to 14,000 patients) were expected to relapse or be resistant to first-line therapy.
 
Prior Clinical Trials for Annamycin
 
Annamycin is a liposome formulated anthracycline (also referred to in literature as “L-Annamycin”). It has been tested in 6 clinical trials and 114 patients with little to no reported cardiotoxicity and, in the two clinical trials focused on leukemia, with fewer dose-limiting toxicities than are normally expected with doxorubicin (one of the leading first-line anthracyclines used for induction therapy). Each of these trials was conducted by a prior developer of Annamycin, and not by our company. Annamycin demonstrated significant activity in 8 of 16 patients in a Phase I study in adult relapsed or refractory AML and ALL patients, with 6 of 14 patients completely clearing leukemic bone marrow blasts. The reason only 14 (rather than 16) patients were tested for leukemic bone marrow blasts is that 2 of the 16 patients succumbed to their disease before bone marrow testing could be completed. In a 30 patient dose-ranging Phase I/II study in ALL, 3 of 8 patients treated with the maximum tolerable dose cleared their leukemic blasts to a level sufficient to qualify for a bone marrow transplant. One of these patients went on to receive a successful curative bone marrow transplant. The other two of these three patients died of tumor lysis syndrome, a condition resulting from the overloading of their system with the debris from leukemic blast cells destroyed by the induction therapy. Armed with the knowledge of this potential, prophylactic pretreatment intended to protect patients from the effects of tumor lysis syndrome will be deployed where appropriate in future trials. Based on the results of the above clinical trials, we believe Annamycin may be different from currently approved induction therapy drugs in four key ways: (i) it has demonstrated clinical activity in a patient population for whom there are currently no effective therapies, (ii) it appears to be capable of avoiding the “multi-drug resistance” mechanisms that have been associated with limiting the effectiveness of currently approved anthracyclines; (iii) it has been shown to be non-cardiotoxic in animal models and little to no cardiotoxicity has been reported from the use of Annamycin in 114 patients; and (iv) in certain AML cell lines, it has been shown to be more potent than one of the leading approved anthracyclines.
 
Based on initial conversations with the FDA, because of the serious unmet medical need, we believe Annamycin may qualify for accelerated approval based on our planned clinical trials. In order to facilitate our communication with the FDA, we requested access to and reviewed in detail the available data supporting the dose-ranging Phase I/II clinical trial discussed above, which was conducted by a previous developer of Annamycin. In October 2016, we announced that we had identified some positive findings from this review, which gave rise to a modification of our own clinical development plan. We had indicated that our plan was to conduct a detailed review of the clinical results generated by that prior developer, and then to use those results to reestablish an IND in order to continue clinical trials of Annamycin. However, in the course of our review, we identified that Annamycin may have greater potential for efficacy than we originally believed, based on an unexpected potential opportunity to increase the drug’s Maximum Tolerable Dose (“MTD”).
 
In particular, the Dose Limiting Toxicities (“DLTs”) reported in the previous trial that led to the establishment of the current MTD of 150 mg/m2 were all from patients who had an unusually high number of first-line induction therapy failures prior to being treated with Annamycin. Specifically, of the three patients in the last clinical trial who experienced these DLTs, one of them had failed nineteen prior induction therapy attempts, another had failed sixteen and the other had failed fifteen before being enrolled in the trial. We concluded from our review of this data that, if the heavily treated patients are excluded from the data set, the MTD could have been closer to 250 mg/m2, substantially higher than the level that was actually set by this previous trial.
 
6


We view this as an encouraging development because it means we may have an opportunity to increase the MTD for our next trial from 150 mg/m2 to 200 or even 250 mg/m2. If that turns out to be the case, we believe it could increase the chance for positive outcomes in our next trial.
 
With the discovery that we may be able to increase our MTD, we determined to adjust our clinical strategy by adding in a Phase I arm to our next Phase II trial, which will add expense to our development effort. We believe this change in strategy will add several months to the eventual final approval of the drug, if the drug is approved.
 
Because the prior developer of Annamycin allowed their IND to lapse, we are required to submit a new IND for continued clinical trials with Annamycin. We filed our IND application for Annamycin, with the clinical strategy of increasing the MTD mentioned above, on February 10, 2017. In subsequent discussions with us, FDA requested certain revisions to the protocol, additional information, and additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”). We have the additional information, have made the requested revisions to the protocol, and we are working on developing the CMC data. In the interim, we have withdrawn the IND application in order to resubmit it when the requested data are available. We believe that resubmission of the IND application will occur in time for the IND to go into effect and the announcement of the beginning of Phase I/II clinical trials in the first half of 2017. However, if we are unable to obtain the required CMC data on a timely basis, we will be delayed in resubmitting our IND application, which will delay the commencement of our clinical trials beyond the first half of 2017.
 
On March 21, 2017 we received notice that FDA had granted Orphan Drug designation for Annamycin for the treatment of AML, effective March 20, 2017.
 
Little to No Cardiotoxicity
 
 One of the key dose-limiting toxicities associated with currently available anthracyclines is their propensity to induce life-threatening heart damage. This is especially problematic for pediatric leukemia patients whose life spans can be severely shortened by the very induction therapy designed to cure them of acute leukemia. In the animal model relied upon by the FDA as an indicator of human cardiotoxicity, the non-liposomal (free) form of Annamycin has been shown to be significantly less likely than doxorubicin to create heart lesions in mice, and the liposomal formulation (L-Annamycin) has been shown in these same models to have reduced cardiotoxicity to the point where it is unlikely to cause harm to human patients. This possible lack of human cardiotoxicity means L-Annamycin may be able to be used more aggressively in helping patients achieve remission. This would be especially valuable in the case of pediatric acute leukemia (both AML and ALL) where long-term survival can be greatly impacted by cardiotoxicity. Unless otherwise noted, all of our references to Annamycin refer to the liposomal form (L-Annamycin).
Circumventing Multidrug Resistance
 
 In addition to cardiotoxicity, the effectiveness of currently approved anthracyclines is limited by their propensity for succumbing to “multidrug resistance,” whereby transporters (one type of which is referred to as a “P-glycoprotein pump”) develop on the outer surface of cells to expel drugs like anthracyclines as a natural defense mechanism. The dosing of current therapies cannot be increased in an attempt to overcome multidrug resistance because of the likelihood of cardiotoxicity and other serious side effects. This limitation prevents adequate dosing of current anthracyclines to produce lasting remission. A laboratory study has suggested that Annamycin may resist being expelled by P-glycoprotein pumps and other similar tested multidrug resistance transporters, which may mean the drug circumvents multidrug resistance. This characteristic has been shown in pre-clinical testing to allow for higher drug uptake in diseased cells, which we believe could allow for more effective induction therapy with less risk to the patient.


7


In order for anthracyclines to provide effective induction therapy, they must be allowed to accumulate in leukemic cells sufficiently to enter the cell’s nucleus, where they damage the cell’s DNA and induce apoptosis (cell death). As induction therapy progresses, however, the targeted cells can develop a natural defense mechanism to prevent the anthracycline activity. The graphic below provides a simplified depiction of the formation of a P-glycoprotein pump on the outer surface (membrane) of a leukemic cell. As typical anthracyclines enter the cell, they are attracted to such pumps and are expelled (referred to as “efflux”) before they can accumulate sufficiently to serve their purpose. In contrast, Annamycin appears to avoid such pumps, thereby being allowed to accumulate sufficiently to destroy the leukemia cell despite the presence of the multidrug resistance mechanisms.
 



The WP1066 Portfolio
 
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1066 Portfolio and its close analogs, molecules targeting the modulation of key oncogenic transcription factors.
Clinical Testing of WP1066 Portfolio
 
In vitro testing has shown a high level of activity for WP1066 against a wide range of solid tumors, and in vivo testing has shown significant activity against head and neck, pancreatic, stomach, and ovarian cancers, as well as metastatic melanoma and glioblastoma, among others. In vivo testing in mouse tumor models has shown that WP1066 inhibits tumor growth, blocks angiogenesis (a process that provides necessary blood supply to tumors) and increases survival.
 
With respect to our WP1066 Portfolio, we must complete pre-clinical toxicology testing, along with additional chemistry, manufacturing and control work to fully characterize the drug, establish the desired formulation and develop reference standards for future drug release, among other things, prior to submitting an application for IND. A clinician at MD Anderson has advised us that she is proceeding with a physician-sponsored IND for WP1066 treatment of brain tumors. We are not participating in this IND process. The clinician has submitted an IND to the FDA and has indicated that this IND is on hold until documentation of Good Manufacturing Process, or GMP, production of WP1066 can be presented to the FDA.

An analog of WP1066, referred to as WP1220, was previously the subject of an IND (WP1220 was referred to as MOL4239 for purposes of this IND) related to use of the molecule in the topical treatment of psoriasis. Clinical trials were commenced on WP1220 in the US, but were terminated early due to limited efficacy in the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques. Notwithstanding its limitations in treating psoriasis, our pre-clinical research has suggested that WP1220 may be effective in inhibiting cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in multiple CTCL cell lines. Based on this data, we are collaborating with a Polish drug development company, Dermin, which has received Polish government grant money to develop WP1220 in Poland for the topical treatment of early stage CTCL patients. CTCL is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer for which there are limited treatment options.
 
We also conducted a Phase II clinical trial for WP1066 for the topical treatment of psoriasis, however this trial was terminated early as a significant number of patients experienced a non-permanent worsening of their psoriatic plaques after extended use of the drug, suggesting that its use as a topical agent for non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis will require further study to optimize dosing and scheduling regimens.
 
Scientific Rationale for WP1066 Portfolio
 
Cellular biology depends upon signaling mechanisms to regulate functions such as cell growth, death and adaptation. Signal “transduction” is such a mechanism that converts an upstream stimulus to a cell into a specific cellular response. Signal transduction starts with a signal to a receptor or via a compound capable of passing through the cell membrane and ends with a change in cell function. The end result of this signal is often the activation of “transcription,” whereby genetic information is expressed and, in the case of oncogenic transcription, disease processes are initiated or maintained.
 
Receptors span the cell membrane, with part of the receptor outside and part inside the cell. When a chemical signal represented by a specific protein binds to the outer portion of the receptor, it conveys another signal inside the cell. Often there is a cascade of signals within the cell, wherein an upstream inducer starts a chain of events that resembles a domino effect. Collectively, this sequence is referred to as a “signaling pathway.” Eventually, the signal creates a change in the cell function by changing the expression of specific genes and production of specific proteins within the cell, and again, in the case of tumor development, such expression results in unwanted oncogenic processes.
 
Importantly, while normal healthy cell function relies on signaling mechanisms, diseases are capable of co-opting these mechanisms with negative consequences. Oncogenic processes (including inflammation and proliferation) depend upon signaling pathways that are responsible for coordinating functions such as cell growth, survival and cell differentiation. A particular class of proteins referred to as Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (such proteins are “STATs”) regulates the process of disease cell survival and proliferation, angiogenesis and immune system function and is persistently activated in a large number of human inflammatory processes and in hyper-proliferating diseases. Because certain of these proteins are known to be co-opted by tumor cells, we refer to them as “oncogenic transcription factors,” of which certain STATs are a subset.
 
Some STATs, such as STAT3, can be activated by any one of many different upstream inducers, making them very difficult to target by blocking just one or more of these upstream inducers. We believe that blocking a targeted STAT directly rather than via its multiple upstream inducers should result in greater efficacy with lower toxicity.

In the diagram shown below, any one of many different pathways (categorized as Growth Factor Receptors, Cytokine Receptors and Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) triggers the activation of STAT3 proteins in a process called “phosphorylation”. In this process, phosphates attach to corresponding receptors on STAT3 and, eventually, two phosphorylated STAT3 proteins (“p-STAT3”) bind together in a pair referred to as a “dimer.” Once the dimer is formed, it enters the cell nucleus and triggers gene transcription. Conversely, if we reduce the presence of p-STAT3 before dimers can be formed, we can prevent the triggering of gene transcription and effectively inhibit the disease process.
 


The upstream effectors shown in the above diagram (SRC, JAK and ABL) are just some of those capable of activating STAT3 once they themselves are activated by a variety of signal compounds. The complexity and diversity of pathways capable of activating STAT3 make it very difficult to develop effective drugs that attempt to target the upstream effectors. Furthermore, many of these upstream pathways are necessary for normal healthy cell function, so blocking them indiscriminately can lead to unwanted toxicities.
 
Published research has identified STAT3 as a master regulator of a wide range of tumors and linked STAT3 activation with the progression of these tumors. For this reason, it is believed that direct inhibition of p-STAT3 may be an effective way to reduce or eliminate the progression of these diseases.
 
Many research efforts have been directed toward development of specific methods to control activation of STAT3, but most have focused on targeting the upstream effectors of these pathways like growth factors, cytokines, and specific kinases including Janus kinases (JAKs). However, we believe that the multifactorial nature of the activation of STAT3 limits the effectiveness of such upstream approaches. Because the activity of p-STAT3 is a final and determinative step in triggering unwanted transcription, we believe it is preferable to inhibit p-STAT3 more directly and independently from upstream effectors.
 
We believe the WP1066 Portfolio represents a novel class of agents capable of hitting multiple targets, including p-STAT3, regardless of their upstream method of activation. Numerous preclinical tests involving a wide range of tumor cells suggest that by inhibiting the presence of p-STAT3, WP1066 directly attacks tumor cells. We believe the effectiveness of WP1066 is not only the result of attacking tumors directly, but also indirectly by stimulating the immune system, increasing the patient’s natural ability to fight off tumor development. STAT1 is believed to stimulate T-cell activity and thereby the immune system responsible for fighting tumors. WP1066 has been shown to increase the activity of STAT1 at the same time it inhibits the activity of p-STAT3. We believe this dual activity makes WP1066 a uniquely promising anticancer drug candidate, although we recognize that substantial additional preclinical and clinical research remains to be done, and may not bear out these early results and our optimism.

We believe the combination of the direct and indirect effects of WP1066 may ultimately be shown to provide significant tumor suppression and increased survival in a number of in vitro cancer models. Below is one example of an animal model suggesting an increase in survival by treating mice with metastatic melanoma with WP1066.
 


The WP1122 Portfolio
 
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1122 Portfolio and similar molecules targeting the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and related central nervous system malignancies.
 
We believe this technology has the potential to target a wide variety of solid tumors, which eventually become resistant to all treatments, and thereby provide a large and important opportunity for novel drugs. Notwithstanding this potential, we are focused on the treatment of central nervous system malignancies and especially GBM. Although less prevalent than some larger categories of solid tumors, cancers of the central nervous system are particularly aggressive and resistant to treatment. The prognosis for such patients can be particularly grim and the treatment options available to their physicians are among the most limited of any cancer.
 
The American Cancer Society has estimated 23,770 new cases of brain and other nervous system cancers will occur in the United States in 2016, resulting in 16,050 deaths. Despite the severity and poor prognosis of these tumors, there are few FDA-approved drugs on the market.
 
We have preliminary preclinical data for WP1122, including in vitro activity against cancer cell lines, as well as data on survival of animals subjected to xenografts of human brain tumors, including data regarding biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. In non-optimal doses and treatment regimes, WP1122 performed equal to or better than the current market leader, temozolomide and provided for superior survival for animals treated in combination with temozolomide. Notwithstanding these early results, we recognize that substantial additional preclinical and clinical research remains to be done, and may not support these initial findings or their translation into activity in humans.
 
Scientific Rationale for WP1122
 
 Science has recognized that many cancer cells have a unique metabolism, distinct from that of normal cells. Dubbed the “Warburg Effect” because of its discoverer, tumors rely preferentially on glycolysis for the metabolism of glucose, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, for energy (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) production. This alternative form of energy production makes cancer cells as much as 17 times more dependent on glucose than normal cells.
 
The fundamental mechanism for imaging actively growing tumors using positron emission tomography (PET scans) is the Warburg Effect. A radiolabeled glucose decoy called F18DG accumulates disproportionately in tumors because of their dramatically increased rate of glucose uptake and accumulation.
 
11


Researchers have theorized that if a tumor’s access to glucose could be blocked, the tumor could be starved out of existence. Previous attempts at targeting the metabolism of tumor cells have failed due to the rapid metabolism and short half-life (minutes) of the drugs being investigated. Efforts to target tumor metabolism in the brain were further thwarted by the inability to get glycolytic inhibitors into the brain in sufficient/therapeutic amounts due to the presence of what is called the “blood brain barrier.”
 
We believe WP1122 has the potential for developing a technology platform for enabling increased cellular uptake, increased drug half-life and, importantly, an increased ability to cross the blood brain barrier, enabling greater uptake in the brain. Our approach was inspired by the same principle that distinguishes morphine from heroin. Heroin is chemically the diacetyl ester of morphine. While morphine has a limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier (making it a good candidate for pain killing without impairing mental function), its diacetyl form, heroin, has the ability to accumulate in the brain by 10 to 100 times more than morphine. Once across the blood brain barrier, the acetyl groups are cleaved off by natural enzyme esterases, leaving pure morphine to accumulate in the brain. Similarly, we believe, based on pre-clinical testing, that WP1122, the diacetyl form of a glucose analog and decoy known as “2-DG,” crosses the blood brain barrier where its acetyl groups are cleaved off, allowing the resulting 2-DG to accumulate in the brain at a much higher rate than free 2-DG can do by itself.
 
Adding to the difficulty in getting free 2-DG across the blood brain barrier in therapeutic quantities is the relatively short half-life of 2-DG. The free form of 2-DG is rapidly metabolized and rendered ineffective within minutes of entering the body. In contrast, WP1122 has a half-life of approximately 6 hours, making it much more feasible to deliver quantities adequate for a therapeutic effect. In addition, we believe WP1122 may represent an improvement to current PET scan diagnostics techniques because of its unique ability to cross the blood brain barrier. These observations are based only on preliminary data and significant additional development is required to determine if these findings are valid and if they will translate into the desired activity in humans.
 
On October 25, 2016, we announced promising initial results of the preclinical toxicology work on WP1122, our unique inhibitor of glucose metabolism, which is an important driver of glycolytic brain tumor progression and survival. We view this as an important step toward future clinical trials for WP1122. A similar chemical structure to that which turns morphine into heroine has been used to allow WP1122 to successfully enter the brain and increase circulation time. We indicated that preliminary escalating single dose toxicity testing in mice (oral administration) was successfully completed and even at the highest possible dose, no toxic death was observed. In multiple therapeutic doses, WP1122 was well tolerated during intense twice-daily oral dosing.
 
Overview of the market for our anti-cancer drugs
 
 Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease. In 2014, an estimated 14.5 million people in the United States were living with a past or current diagnosis of cancer and, in 2016, the National Institutes of Health estimated that nearly 1.7 million new cases will be diagnosed and almost 600,000 Americans will die from cancer.

Digestive, reproductive, breast and respiratory cancers comprise 65% of expected cancer diagnoses in 2016, while cancers like leukemia and brain tumors are considered “rare diseases”. Leukemia in particular, can be divided into acute, chronic and other, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprising 26,540 of the estimated 60,140 new cases expected in the United States this year.
 
The worldwide cancer drug business has been estimated to represent approximately $100 billion in annual sales. Our lead drug, Annamycin, is in a class of drugs referred to as anthracyclines, which are chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA of targeted cancer cells. The most common approved anthracyclines are daunorubicin and doxorubicin and, prior to the expansion of their generic equivalents, annual revenues generated from anthracyclines have been estimated in the range of $600 million. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are treated with anthracyclines. One industry report estimates that annual drug revenues generated from the demand for AML-related therapies in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain were in the range of $151 million in 2012, and we believe that this number may increase if and when improved AML treatments are available.
 
Our other two active development projects have applications (among others) in the treatment of brain tumors, another rare disease for which there are few available treatments. The leading brain tumor drug is temozolomide, a drug introduced under the brand name Temodar. In 2012, one industry source reported annual revenues of approximately $882 million for Temodar before the expiration of its patent protection, at which point generic versions of the drug began to enter the market and reduce prices.
 
The Orphan Drug Act and other legislative initiatives provide incentives, including market exclusivity and accelerated approval pathways, for companies that pursue the development of treatments for rare diseases and serious diseases for which there are few or no acceptable available treatment alternatives. Over the last 10 years, an increasing number of companies have begun using these designations to obtain new drug approvals for drugs where patent coverage has expired and/or where accelerated approval appears possible. An IMS Health report estimated that, in 2013, the sale of drugs with full or partial Orphan Drug exclusivity represented approximately $29 billion in revenue. We consider obtaining Orphan Drug exclusivity and accelerated approval to be an important part of our development strategy for our drug candidates. Notwithstanding these potential opportunities, we can provide no assurance that our drugs will receive Orphan Drug designation (other than Annamycin, which recently received such designation) or, if approved, exclusivity or any other special designation that could, among other things, provide for accelerated approval.

Competition 
 
We operate in a highly competitive segment of the pharmaceutical market, which market is highly competitive as a whole. We face competition from numerous sources including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources. Additionally, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, and some may be in direct competition with us. We may also compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

The unmet medical need for more effective cancer therapies is such that anticancer drugs are, by far, the leading class of drugs in development. These include a wide array of products against cancer targeting many of the same indications as our drug candidates. While the introduction of newer targeted agents may result in extended overall survival, induction therapy regimens are likely to remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment in the foreseeable future.
 
There are a number of established therapies that may be considered competitive for the cancer indications for which we intend to develop our lead product, Annamycin. A key consideration when treating AML patients is whether the patient is suitable for intensive therapy. The standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who can tolerate intensive therapy is cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or daunorubicin). For some patients, primarily those less than 60 years of age, a stem cell transplant could also be considered if the induction regimen is effective in attaining a CR (Complete Response). The regimen of cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline has been the standard of care for decades. A patient not suitable for intensive therapy may be offered the option for low-intensity therapy such as low-dose cytarabine, azacitidine or decitabine. It should be noted that, in the US, these are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of AML patients and there remains no effective therapy for these patients or for relapsed or refractory AML. The initial focus for Annamycin development is in patients for whom the standard induction regimen has failed. Also, several major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs for the treatment of AML.
 
A number of attempts have been made or are under way to provide an improved treatment for AML. Recently, Celator Pharmaceuticals reported Phase III clinical trial results for a new combined formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin (commonly used induction therapy drugs) they call Vyxeos. This new liposome formulation provides a 5:1 ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin in each of three injections. When compared with patients receiving 7 injections of cytarabine and 3 injections of daunorubicin (traditional 7+3 induction therapy), patients receiving Vyxeos achieved an average increase in overall survival of approximately 3.5 months (9.5 months compared with 6 months). Despite this extension of overall survival, Vyxeos did not reduce the toxic side effects of daunorubicin (including cardiotoxicity) and it failed to qualify a significant majority of patients for curative bone marrow transplant.
 
Drugs attempting to target a subset of AML patients who present with particular anomalies involving a gene referred to as FLT3 are currently in clinical trials, as well as other approaches that include immunotherapy relying on other biomarkers, other attempts at improved chemotherapy and alternative approaches to radiation therapy. Other approaches to improve the effectiveness of induction therapy are in early stage clinical trials and, although they do not appear to address the underlying problems with anthracyclines, we can provide no assurance that such improvements, if achieved, would not adversely impact the need for improved anthracyclines. A modified version of doxorubicin designed to reduce cardiotoxicity is in clinical trials for the treatment of sarcoma and, although this drug does not appear to address multidrug resistance and is not currently intended for the treatment of acute leukemia, we can provide no assurance that it will not become a competitive alternative to Annamycin. Although we are not aware of any other single agent therapies in clinical trials that would directly compete against Annamycin in the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML, we can provide no assurance that such therapies are not in development, will not receive regulatory approval and will reach market before our drug candidate Annamycin. In addition, any such competing therapy may be more effective and / or cost-effective than ours.
  
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the US, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be marketed and distributed.
 
17


In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA and related enforcement activity could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the US generally involves the following:
 
·           Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
 
·           Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
 
·           Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
 
·           Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product;
 
·           Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced, to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 
·           Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
 
·           FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals, and continued compliance are inherently uncertain.
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of the single and repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold or the sponsor withdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies for various reasons. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical study.

Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
 
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
·          Phase 1: The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients, with a goal of characterizing the safety profile of the drug and establishing a maximum tolerable dose (“MTD”). Our pharmaceutical products fall into this latter category because its products are intended to treat cancer and contain cytotoxic agents. Hence, our Phase 1 studies are conducted in late-stage cancer patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with other agents.
 
·          Phase 2: With the maximum tolerable dose established in a Phase 1 trial, the pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population at the MTD to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
 
·          Phase 3: Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are usually required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options. In some instances, an NDA approval may be obtained based on Phase 2 clinical data with the understanding that the approved drug can be sold subject to a confirmatory trial to be conducted post-approval.
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are often used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also may require Phase 4 studies, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) and post-marketing surveillance, among other things, to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 
19


Concurrent with clinical studies, companies may complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees. A waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months after the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard review NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months after the 60-day filing date for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.
 
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new pharmaceutical products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new pharmaceutical products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, if the FDA determines that the schedule is acceptable and if the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for market, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treate a serious condition and it offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new pharmaceutical product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, accelerated approval may be available for a product intended to treat a serious condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, which means the product may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval, which could impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which the Company receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and/or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses.
 
We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our products covered by U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process for a product the approval of which is the first permitted commercial marketing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent unless an extension is obtained. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and renders a decision on the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may be able to apply for extension of patent term for one or more of our currently licensed patents or any future owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending upon the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA or seeking approval for a similar product. Pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms and may be granted based on the completion of a pediatric clinical study that “fairly responds” to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not, and frequently does not, include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate.
 
Orphan Drug exclusivity prevents for seven years the approval of another product with the same active moiety for the same rare disease. If a product is a new chemical entity (i.e., generally that the moiety has not previously been approved), it may receive five years of exclusivity, during which period FDA may not accept for review certain NDAs for another product with the same moiety. If approval of a product required new clinical data, it may convey three years of exclusivity against approval of certain NDAs for similar products.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular pharmaceutical product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we may receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
International Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our current and future product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a product, approval of a product must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries, or jurisdictions such as the EU, before clinical studies or marketing of the product can commence in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain regulatory authorities may require us to repeat previously conducted preclinical and/or clinical studies under specific criteria for approval in their respective country or jurisdictions, which may delay and/or increase the cost of approval in certain markets targeted for approval by us.
Subsequent Event
 
On February 9, 2017, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as representative of the several underwriters identified therein (collectively, the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which we sold in a registered public offering (the “Offering”), 3,710,000 units, priced at a public offering price of $1.35 per unit, with each unit consisting of: (i) one share of common stock, (ii) a five-year Series A warrant to purchase 0.50 of a share of common stock, (iii) a 90-day Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (iv) a five-year Series C warrant to purchase 0.50 of a share of common stock. The Series C warrants in a unit may only be exercised to the extent and in proportion to a holder of the Series C warrants exercising its Series B warrants included in the unit. The Series A and Series C warrant have an exercise price of $1.50 per share of common stock. The Series B warrant has an exercise price of $1.35 per share of common stock.
 
Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase an additional 556,500 shares of common stock and/or an additional 556,500 warrants combinations (comprised of an aggregate of 278,250 Series A warrants, 556,500 Series B warrants and 278,250 Series C warrants), in any combinations thereof, from us to cover over-allotments at the public offering price per share of $1.349 and public offering price per warrant combination of $.001, respectively, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. Upon the closing of the Offering, the Underwriters exercised the over-allotment option with respect to 278,100 warrant combinations. We received approximately $4.4 million in net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.
 
23


Subsequent to March 22, 2017, investors in the aforementioned offering on February 9, 2017, have excerised approximately 600,000 Series B warrants resulting in approximately gross proceeds to the Company of $800,000 and approximately 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock being issued.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had two full-time employees and four part-time employees, and accordingly, a high percentage of the work performed for our development projects is outsourced to qualified independent contractors.
Legal Proceedings 
 
We are not subject to any litigation.
