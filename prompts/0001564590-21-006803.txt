Reportable Segment
 Upon completion of the spin-off of its former Electronics segment on June 29, 2018, Autoliv concluded that it has one reportable segment based on the way the Company evaluates its financial performance and manages its operations. Autoliv’s remaining business is comprised of passive safety products - principally airbags (including steering wheels and inflators) and seatbelts. For more information regarding the Company’s segment reporting, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
Products, Market and Competition 
 Products
 Saving more lives on the road is a key health priority as our world population grows and develops. However, population expansion in growth markets and the rise of megacities creates new complexities. To meet this challenge, we develop automotive safety solutions that work in real life situations. 
 Our safety systems such as seatbelts and airbags substantially mitigate human consequences of traffic accidents.
 The airbag module is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact. It consists of the container, airbag cushion and an inflator. The purpose of the airbag is to provide the occupants a cushioning and restraint during a crash event to prevent any impact or impact-caused injuries between the occupant and the interior of the vehicle. 
 Seatbelts can reduce the overall risk of serious injuries in frontal crashes by as much as 60% due to advanced seatbelt technologies such as pretensioners and load limiters.
 Autoliv also manufactures steering wheels that are crafted to ensure they meet safety requirements and are functional as well as stylish.
 Market and Competition
 Consumer research clearly shows that consumers want safe vehicles, and several significant trends are likely to have a positive influence on overall safety content per vehicle. These include:

1) | Society becoming increasingly focused on Vision Zero, which includes a goal of reducing traffic fatalities and their associated costs;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Demographic trends of increased urbanization, aging driver populations and increased safety focus in growth markets;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3
 






 
3) | Evolving government regulations and test rating systems to improve the safety of vehicles in various markets, such as the updated Euro New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), China NCAP and USNCAP; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The trend towards autonomous driving vehicles will add new demands, and to provide protection of occupants in new seating positions, regardless of how a driver or other passenger are seated, will require new and more complex solutions.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The automotive safety market is driven by two primary factors: light vehicle production (LVP) and content per vehicle (CPV).
 The first growth driver, LVP, has increased at an average annual growth rate of around 1.3% since the start of Autoliv in 1997 despite the substantial drop in LVP in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. LVP is forecasted to grow to close to 88 million by 2023 from approximately 72 million in 2020, as the market is expected to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to IHS Markit. 
 Unlike LVP, where Autoliv can only aim to be on the best-selling platforms, Autoliv can influence CPV more directly by continuously developing and introducing new technologies with higher value-added features. Over the long term, this increases average safety CPV and has caused our markets to grow faster than the LVP. 
 
Since 1997, the Company’s sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for passive safety has been 4.4% compared to the market rate of around 1.9% which includes an LVP growth of around 1.3%. Our outperformance is a result of a steady flow of new passive safety technologies, strong focus on quality and a superior global footprint both in products and engineering. This has enabled Autoliv to increase its market share from 27% in 1997 to 42% in 2020.
 In the Developed Markets (Western Europe, North America, Japan and South Korea) the CPV is around $300. CPV growth in these regions will mainly come from new safety systems such as active seatbelts, knee airbags and front-center airbags along with improved protection for pedestrians and rear-seat occupants like bag-in-belt or more advanced seatbelts.
 In our Growth Markets (all markets other than the Developed Markets), we see great opportunities for CPV growth from more airbags and advanced seatbelt products. Average CPV in our Growth Markets is around $190, approximately $110 less than in the Developed Markets. 
 As a result of higher installation rates of airbags, more advanced seatbelt products and more complex steering wheels, CPV is expected to increase at a similar pace in both Developed and Growth markets over the next 3-4 years. LVP in Growth Markets is expected to increase faster than in the Developed Markets during the same period. Despite a negative LVP mix effect from higher growth in low CPV markets, the annual passive safety market (seatbelts and airbags, including steering wheels), is expected to grow from around $17 billion in 2020 to more than $23 billion over the next 3-4 years, based on the current macro-economic outlook and our internal market intelligence and estimates. The highest growth rate is expected in steering wheels, where Autoliv has a global market share of around 37%, generated by the trend toward higher-value steering wheels with leather and additional features.
 In seatbelts, Autoliv has reached a global market share of around 44%, primarily due to being the technology leader with several important innovations such as pretensioners and active seatbelts. Our strong market position is also a reflection of our superior global footprint. Seatbelts are the primary life-saving safety product and are also an important requirement in low-end vehicles for the Growth Markets. This provides us with an excellent opportunity to benefit from the expected growth in this segment of the market.
 The market for airbags, where Autoliv has a market share of around 42%, is expected to grow mainly as result of higher installation rates of inflatable curtains, side airbags and knee airbags. Additionally, the new front center airbag is expected to start to contribute to the market growth. 
 
Our competitors
 Autoliv is the clear market leader in passive safety with an estimated global market share of 42%. 
 ZF, our largest competitor, is a global leader in driveline and chassis technology as well as in passive safety technologies, and is one of the largest global automotive suppliers.
 Our second largest competitor is U.S.-based Joyson Safety Systems (JSS). JSS is a Chinese owned company and is the result of the merger between Key Safety Systems (KSS) and Takata Corporation after KSS acquired Takata in 2018.
 In Japan, Brazil, South Korea and China there are a number of local suppliers that have close ties with the domestic vehicle manufacturers. For example, Toyota uses “keiretsu” (in-house) suppliers Tokai Rika for seatbelts and Toyoda Gosei for airbags and steering wheels. These suppliers generally receive most of the Toyota business in Japan, in the same way, Mobis, a major supplier to Hyundai/Kia in South Korea, generally receives a significant part of their business.
 Other competitors include Nihon Plast and Ashimori of Japan, Jinheng of China, Samsong in South Korea and Chris Cintos de Seguranca in South America. Collectively, these competitors account for the majority of the remaining market share in passive safety.
 Additional information concerning our products, markets and competition is included in the “Risks and Risk Management” section under Item 7 of this Annual Report.

Manufacturing and Production
 See “Item 2. Properties” for a description of Autoliv’s principal properties. The component factories manufacture inflators, propellant, initiators, textile cushions, webbing, pressed steel parts, springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seatbelt and airbag assembly and steering wheels. The assembly factories source components from a number of parties, including Autoliv’s own component factories, and assemble complete restraint systems for “just-in-time” delivery to customers. The products manufactured by Autoliv’s consolidated subsidiaries in 2020 consisted of approximately 126 million complete seatbelt systems (of which approximately 80 million were fitted with pretensioners), approximately 87 million side airbags (including curtain airbags and front center airbags), approximately 49 million frontal airbags, approximately 0.5 million other airbags and approximately 17 million steering wheels.
 
Autoliv’s “just-in-time” delivery system is designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service. “Just-in-time” deliveries require final assembly or, at least, distribution centers in geographic areas close to customers to facilitate rapid delivery. The fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding their production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as those produced in Europe, Japan or the U.S. increases the importance for suppliers to have assembly capacity in several countries. Consolidation among our customers also supports this trend.
 
Autoliv’s assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations unless there is a disruption in the supply of raw materials and components. When dramatic shifts in LVP occur, Autoliv can generally adjust capacity in response to any changes in demand within a few days by adding or removing work shifts and within a few months by adding or removing standardized production and assembly lines. Most of Autoliv’s assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity. As a result, Autoliv can usually adjust its manufacturing capacity faster than its customers can adjust their capacity as a result of fluctuations in the general demand for vehicles or in the demand for a specific vehicle model, provided that customers promptly notify Autoliv when they become aware of such changes in demand.
 
When dramatic shifts in LVP occur or when there is a shift in regional LVP, the capacity adjustments can take more time and be more costly. Additionally, when there is significant demand for a given product due to a major recall of a competitor’s product, like certain of our customers have experienced, capacity adjustments may take time.
 
We could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain, which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production. For more information, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
 
Quality Management
 Autoliv believes that superior quality is a prerequisite to being considered a leading global supplier of automotive safety systems and is key to our financial performance, because quality excellence is critical for winning new orders, preventing recalls and maintaining low scrap rates. Autoliv has for many years emphasized a “zero-defect” proactive quality policy and continues to strive to improve its working methods. This means that Autoliv’s products are expected to always meet performance expectations and be delivered to its customers at the right times and in the right amounts. Furthermore, we believe our continued quality improvements further enhance our reputation among our customers, employees and governmental authorities.
 
Although quality has always been paramount in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, automobile manufacturers have become increasingly focused on quality with even less tolerance for any deviations. This intensified focus on quality is partially due to an increase in the number of vehicle recalls for a variety of reasons (not just safety), including a few high-profile vehicle recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. We have not been immune to the recalls that have been impacting the automotive industry.
 
We continue to drive our quality initiative called “Q5” which was initiated in the summer of 2010. It is an integral part of our strategy of shaping a proactive quality culture of zero defects. It is called “Q5” because it addresses quality in five dimensions: products, customers, growth, behavior and suppliers. The goal of Q5 is to firmly tie together quality with value within all of our processes and for all of our employees, thereby leading to the best value for our customers. Since 2010, we have continually expanded this quality initiative to provide additional skills training to more employees and suppliers. These activities have significantly improved our quality performance.
 
In our pursuit of excellence in quality, we have developed a chain of four “defense lines” against potential quality issues. These defense lines consist of: 1) robust product designs, 2) flawless components from suppliers and our own in-house component companies, 3) manufacturing flawless products with a system for verifying that our products conform with specifications and 4) an advanced traceability system in the event of a recall.
 
Our pursuit of quality excellence extends from the earliest phases of product development to the proper disposal of a product following many years of use in a vehicle. Autoliv’s comprehensive Autoliv Product Development System includes several key check points during the process of developing new products that are designed to ensure that such products are well-built and have no hidden defects. Through this process, we work closely with our suppliers and customers to set clear standards that help to ensure robust component design and lowest cost for function in order to proactively prevent problems and ensure we deliver only the best designs to the market.
 
The Autoliv Production System (“APS”), based on the goals of improving quality and efficiency, is at the core of Autoliv’s manufacturing philosophy. APS integrates essential quality elements, such as mistake proofing, statistical process control and operator involvement, into the manufacturing processes so all Autoliv associates are aware of and understand the critical connection between themselves and our lifesaving products. This “zero-defect” principle extends beyond Autoliv to the entire supplier base. All of our suppliers must accept the strict quality standards in the global Autoliv Supplier Manual, which defines our quality requirements and focuses on preventing bad parts from being produced by our suppliers and helps eliminate defective intermediate products in our assembly lines as early as possible. In 
 5
 





addition, Autoliv’s One Product One Process (“1P1P”) initiative is our strategy for developing and managing standardization of both core products and customer-specific features, leading not only to improved quality, but also greater cost efficiency and more efficient supply chain management.
 
IATF 16949:2016 is one of the automotive industry’s most widely used international standards for quality management. All of our facilities that ship products to OEMs are regularly certified according to the International Automotive Task Force (IATF) standards.
 
Environmental and Safety Regulations
 For information on how environmental and safety regulations impact our business, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations’ and ‘Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market’” in Item 1A and “Risks and Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.
Raw Materials
 Approximately 50% of our sales comes from direct material purchased from external suppliers. Autoliv mainly purchases manufactured components and raw materials for its operations. We take several actions to mitigate raw material fluctuations, such as competitive sourcing and looking for alternative materials.
 
For information on the sources and availability of raw materials, see “Risk Factors – ‘Changes in the source, cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins’” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
 Intellectual Property
 We have developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to automotive safety systems and rely on many patents to protect such technology. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. For information on our use of intellectual property and its importance to us, see “Risk Factors – ‘If our patents are declared invalid or our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others, our ability to compete may be impaired’” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Backlog
 Autoliv has frame contracts with automobile manufacturers and such contracts are typically entered into up to three years before the start of production of the relevant car model or platform and provide for a term covering the life of such car model or platform including service parts after a vehicle model is no longer produced. However, typically these contracts do not provide minimum quantities, firm prices or exclusivity but instead permit the automobile manufacturer to resource the relevant products at given intervals (or at any time) from other suppliers.
Dependence on Customers
 In 2020, our top five customers represented around 53% of our annual sales and our top ten customers represented around 81% of our annual sales. This reflects the concentration of manufacturers in the automotive industry. The five largest OEMs in 2020 accounted for around 51% of global LVP and the ten largest OEMs accounted for around 75% of global LVP. A delivery contract is typically for the lifetime of a vehicle model, which is normally between five and seven years depending on customer platform sourcing preferences and strategies.

 Customer sales trends
 Asian vehicle producers have steadily become more important to Autoliv, and now represent around 47% of our global sales compared to 40% five years ago. The largest increase comes from Japanese OEMs that represented 26% of our global sales five years ago but now accounts for 34% of our global sales in 2020. This is a result of our stronger market position based on our local presence in Japan. European based brands accounted for 31% of our global sales in 2020. The U.S. based OEMs (including Tesla and Chrysler) accounted 
 6
 





for 21% of our global sales. The local Chinese OEMs as a group accounted for around 4% of our global sales in 2020, with Great Wall representing 2%. The fastest growing customer from 2019 to 2020 was Tesla, followed by General Motors.
For information on our dependence on customers, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices’” in Item 1A of this Annual Report and “Dependence on Customers” under the section “Risks and Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Research, Development and Engineering, net (R,D&E)
 No single customer project accounted for more than 5.5% of Autoliv’s total R,D&E, net spending during 2020. To fuel Autoliv’s product portfolio, additional expertise is brought in-house via technology partnerships and licensing agreements.
 During 2020, gross expenditures for Research, Development and Application Engineering (R,D&E) amounted to $557 million compared to $605 million in 2019. Of these amounts, $181 million in 2020 and $199 million in 2019 were related to customer-funded engineering projects and crash tests. Net of this income, R,D&E expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 by 7.4% to 375 million. Of the R,D&E, net expense in 2020, 82% was for projects and programs for which we have customer orders, typically related to vehicle models in development. The remaining 18% was not only for completely new innovations but also for improvements of existing products, standardization and cost reduction projects that will yield greater benefits over time.
 Regulatory Costs
 The fitting of seatbelts in most types of motor vehicles is mandatory in almost all countries and many countries have strict laws regarding the use of seatbelts while in vehicles. In addition, most developed countries require that seats in intercity buses and commercial vehicles be fitted with seatbelts. In the U.S., federal legislation requires frontal airbags on the driver-side and the passenger-side of all new passenger cars since 1998 and in all sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans since 1999.
 
For information concerning the material effects on our business relating to our compliance with government safety regulations, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations’ and ‘Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market’” in Item 1A of this Annual Report and in Item 7 under the section “Risks and Risk Management” of this Annual Report.
 
Human Resources
 Our drive for excellence is what makes us the world’s leading supplier of automotive safety systems. From the earliest stages of product development to sales and design to the final delivery of the finished product our employees are driven by our passion to save more lives.
 The successful execution of our strategies relies on our ability to shape a quality and performance-oriented culture, and to adapt quickly to sudden shifts in our circumstances, as illustrated by the COVID-19 crisis.
