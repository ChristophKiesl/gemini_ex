Item 1. Business
Trean Insurance Group, Inc. ("we" or the "Company") is an established, growth-oriented company providing products and services to the specialty insurance market. Historically, we have focused on specialty casualty markets that we believe are underserved and where our expertise allows us to achieve higher rates, such as niche workers’ compensation markets and small- to mid-sized specialty casualty insurance programs. We underwrite specialty casualty insurance products both through our program partners ("Program Partners") and Owned Managing General Agents ("Owned MGAs"). We also provide our Program Partners with a variety of services including issuing carrier services, claims administration and reinsurance brokerage, from which we generate recurring fee-based revenues. 
We believe that a number of differentiating factors have contributed to our ability to achieve results and growth that historically have outperformed the broader insurance industry. We believe our multi-service value proposition represents a competitive advantage in our target markets, drives deep integration with our Program Partners and allows us to generate more diversified revenue streams. We seek to carefully identify and select our Program Partners, ensure we have closely aligned interests, and grow and expand these relationships over time. We believe we have a competitive advantage in claims management for longer-tailed lines, specifically workers’ compensation, where our in-house capabilities and differentiated philosophy enable us to have lower claims costs and to settle claims more quickly than many of our competitors. Our business strategy is supported by robust controls surrounding program design and underwriting, ongoing monitoring and reinsurance and collateral management as evidenced by our "A" (Excellent) financial strength rating, with a stable outlook, by A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"), a leading rating agency for the insurance industry. This rating is based on matters of concern to policyholders and is not designed or intended for use by investors in evaluating our securities. Our management team has decades of insurance industry experience across underwriting as well as program administration, reinsurance, claims and distribution.
The Company and its subsidiaries are licensed to write business across 49 states and the District of Columbia. We seek to write business in states through select distribution outlets with the potential for attractive underwriting margins, and focus on markets with higher than average premium growth trends. California, Texas and Michigan are our largest markets, representing approximately 25%, 14% and 7%, respectively, of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Pending Merger
As previously disclosed, on December 15, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Treadstone Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Treadstone Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), providing for the acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Altaris Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Altaris”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Certain investment funds managed by Altaris control Parent and Merger Sub and affiliates of Altaris owned approximately 47% of our outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Merger is considered a “going-private” transaction under the SEC’s rules. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”) effective as of the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”). As a result of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Further, following the Merger, our Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded. In addition, our Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, in each case, in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of our Common Stock.
As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, subject to any applicable withholding taxes, each share of our Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $6.15 in cash, without interest.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various customary conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and 
the other transactions by (x) the holders representing a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Unaffiliated Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) entitled to vote thereon as well as (y) the holders representing a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon; (ii) all required insurance regulatory approvals (or the applicable regulatory authorities’ non-objection to requests for exemptions in respect thereof) shall have been obtained; (iii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”); (iv) the absence of any restraint or law preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (v) the accuracy of Parent’s, Merger Sub’s, and the Company’s representations and warranties (subject to certain materiality qualifiers); (vi) Parent’s, Merger Sub’s, and the Company’s compliance in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (vii) the absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since the date of the Merger Agreement.
Merger-related expenses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $3,081 and are included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
See “Part I—Item 1A Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Proposed Merger” for a discussion of certain risks related to the Merger. 
History
We were founded in 1996 as a reinsurance broker and MGA that targeted smaller, underserved insurance providers writing niche classes of business, predominantly workers’ compensation, accident and health, and medical professional liability.
In 2003, we purchased Benchmark Insurance Company ("Benchmark"), which was licensed in 41 states and the District of Columbia and provided us with an insurance carrier with a financial strength rating of "A-" from A.M. Best. Beginning in 2007, we successfully repositioned Benchmark as a specialty insurance carrier for select, high-performing small- to mid-sized Program Partners. Benchmark is now licensed in 49 states and has an "A" rating from A.M. Best.
In July 2015, we sold an equity stake of 36.4% to certain entities affiliated with Altaris Capital Partners, LLC, a private equity firm (collectively, the "Altaris Funds"). The Altaris Funds subsequently made additional equity investments and owned approximately 47% of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2022.
We have historically made equity investments in or acquired long-term partners where we believe they can add substantial value to our business. In 2013, we acquired S&C Claims Services, which, prior to the acquisition, had been handling our workers’ compensation claims for over 10 years. In 2017, we acquired American Liberty Insurance Company, Inc. ("ALIC"), a Utah-domiciled insurance company that was a former Program Partner and writes workers’ compensation insurance. ALIC is licensed or eligible to conduct insurance business, and therefore subject to regulation and supervision by insurance regulators, in 38 states and the District of Columbia. In 2018, we acquired ownership interests in two additional Program Partners: (i) a 45% common equity ownership in Compstar Holding Company LLC, the parent company of Compstar Insurance Services, LLC, an MGA underwriting workers’ compensation insurance coverage for California contractors; and (ii) a 100% ownership of Westcap, an MGA underwriting general liability insurance coverages for California contractors. In 2020, we acquired: (i) the remaining equity interest in Compstar Holding Company LLC; and (ii) a 100% ownership interest in 7710 Insurance Company ("7710"), a South Carolina-domiciled insurance company that was a former Program Partner and writes workers' compensation insurance, along with its associated program manager and agency. 7710 is licensed or eligible to conduct insurance business, and therefore subject to regulation and supervision by insurance regulators, in 9 states. In 2021, we acquired Western Integrated Care, LLC ("WIC"), a managed care organization that offers services to workers' compensation insurers to enable employees who are injured on the job to access qualified medical treatment.
On July 20, 2020, we closed the sale of 10,714,286 shares of our Common Stock in our Initial Public Offering ("IPO"), comprised of 7,142,857 shares issued and sold by us and 3,571,429 shares sold by selling stockholders pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-239291), which was declared effective by the SEC on July 15, 2020. On July 22, 2020, we closed the sale of an additional 1,207,142 shares by certain selling stockholders in the IPO pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments. The IPO terminated upon completion of the sale of the above-referenced shares.
On May 19, 2021, we closed the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock, comprised entirely of shares sold by selling stockholders. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our Common Stock by the selling stockholders in 
this offering. As a result of this offering, the Altaris Funds no longer beneficially own more than 50% of our Common Stock, and we are no longer a "controlled company" within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules.

Our competitive strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include:
Expertise and focus in underserved specialty casualty insurance markets. We focus on select markets that we believe are underserved and where we can achieve higher rates, including niche workers’ compensation markets and small- to mid-sized specialty casualty insurance programs. Historically, we have had few competitors in our target markets due to the specialized knowledge, broad licensing and filing authority requirements and complex operational systems necessary to profitably manage these traditionally longer-tailed lines of business. We believe that most other companies of our size and smaller do not possess these capabilities to the degree needed to be competitive with us, while most larger companies that do have the required expertise and capabilities in these areas tend not to participate in our target markets because their business models eschew the type of customized solutions that are needed when working with smaller, more entrepreneurial partners.
Multi-service value proposition for our partners. We believe that our focus on the needs of smaller accounts and the breadth of products and services we offer allow us to better serve the needs of our Program Partners and provide us with greater revenue and profit opportunities. We offer our Program Partners reinsurance brokerage, claims administration, underwriting capacity and, in particular, access to our A.M. Best "A" financial strength rating through issuing carrier services. Our ability to leverage our licenses across multiple products in 49 states and the District of Columbia allows us to provide a national multi-service solution for our Program Partners. Our multi-service offering enables us to develop deep relationships with our Program Partners.
Long-term, carefully selected and aligned relationships with Program Partners. We carefully select the Program Partners we choose to do business with, and design our programs to align risks between parties. We select programs with the intention of building long-term relationships, where our business philosophies align and our Program Partners can grow alongside us. Our management team carefully evaluates potential new programs in conjunction with our underwriting and actuarial departments. We only accept programs that meet our stringent underwriting and actuarial requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we declined approximately 94% of the new opportunities that we evaluated. For every Program Partner we select, we work with them to appropriately align interests and to establish rigorous ongoing reporting and auditing requirements upfront.
Differentiated in-house claims management. We believe that proactively managing our claims, while also accurately setting reserves, is a key aspect of keeping our losses low. In our workers’ compensation business, our claims philosophy is to provide an injured employee high-quality medical care as quickly as possible in order to reduce pain, accelerate healing and lead to a faster and more complete recovery.
Once an injured employee has healed, we aim to settle the claim and obtain a full and complete release of the claim at the earliest opportunity. In California, for the claim year ended December 31, 2021, valued as of December 31, 2022, our average medical cost for the workers' compensation market was $10,110 per claim compared to the California workers' compensation industry average of $30,691, as reported by the Workers' Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau ("WCIRB") at September 30, 2022. For the claim year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 41% of our workers' compensation claims in California within twelve months, compared with the industry average of 33%, as reported by the WCIRB for the year ended December 31, 2021. To provide our policyholders these processing results, we currently average 84 open claims per claims adjuster. In comparison, the 2020 Workers’ Compensation Benchmarking Study by Rising Medical Solutions found that 61% of third-party administrators ("TPAs") had over 100 open claims per claims adjuster.
Significant fee-based income. Our business model generates significant fee-based income from multiple sources including issuing carrier services, claims administration and reinsurance brokerage. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our fee-based income accounted for approximately 2.7%, 4.7% and 5.9% of total revenue, respectively. All of our fee-based income accrues outside of our regulated insurance companies, which we believe enhances our organization’s financial flexibility and increases the visibility of our earnings. Within our insurance companies, we cede a significant portion of the risk we originate to our reinsurance partners. These agreements enable us to maintain broader relationships with our Program Partners than our current capital base would otherwise enable. We believe that our strategy has allowed us to scale our business and provides a consistent fee-based income stream to complement our underwriting business, thus providing us with greater revenue opportunities from our Program Partners than we would be able to access in a traditional insurance underwriter model.
Disciplined risk management across our organization. Our disciplined approach to risk management begins with the extensive due diligence performed during our Program Partner selection process and continues throughout the relationship. We have rigorous ongoing controls and reporting requirements, including with respect to underwriting and ongoing Program Partner diligence. Similarly, we maintain rigorous controls over our reinsurance exposures by maintaining stringent collateral requirements to limit our credit exposure. As a result of providing multiple services to our Program Partners, we have numerous touch points and are in regular communication regarding underwriting, claims handling, reinsurance placement and collateral management, which we believe enhances our ability to manage risks to our organization.
Entrepreneurial and highly experienced management team. Our management team is highly experienced with decades of experience in specialty insurance markets. In addition to this significant industry experience, our team has a long history of continuity in our business. Our business has been led by our Executive Chairman of the Board and founder Andrew M. O’Brien, who previously served as our Chief Executive Officer from our inception in 1996 through July 2022. Effective in July 2022, the role of Chief Executive Officer was assumed by Julie A. Baron, who served in previous roles as President and Chief Operating Officer, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, and Controller of Benchmark since joining the Company in 2007.
Our strategy
We believe that our approach will allow us to continue to achieve our goals of both growing our business and generating attractive returns. Our strategy involves:
Growing within our existing markets. We focus on lines of business that have large markets, including workers' compensation with $51 billion of premiums and all of our other lines of business written with $338 billion in premiums in the United States in 2021 according to S&P Global. By comparison, we generated $651.3 million, $634.2 million and $484.2 million of gross written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We select Program Partners operating in our target markets with whom we believe we can partner to grow within these significant markets. In addition, Benchmark Specialty Insurance Company ("BSIC"), which was created in 2021, writes specialty/niche products through separate program partners, which will provide the group with expanded geographic diversification, rate flexibility and new product offerings on a non-admitted basis opening the excess and surplus lines market. 
Given the size of our markets, we believe that we have ample room to continue to grow our business organically for the foreseeable future. Additionally, as we grow our premiums and capital, we expect to continue to optimize our reinsurance program to drive our risk-adjusted returns.
Selectively adding new Program Partners. We have been selective in choosing our current Program Partners, and will continue to ensure that new Program Partners share our business philosophy and meet our underwriting and returns criteria. We focus on specialty lines and will continue to add programs in these markets. However, we also continue to evaluate potential partnerships in additional lines of business that will leverage our core competencies and provide us with new revenue opportunities.
Opportunistically grow and maintain our Owned MGA business through acquisitions. From time to time, we may have the opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing Program Partners by acquiring equity interests from their management teams. Since 2013, we have successfully completed nine acquisitions of companies with which we have had prior relationships. Seven of these companies write premiums which represented more than 36% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Strengthen and harness our strong and growing capital base. Despite our relatively modest historical balance sheet, we have grown our premiums through the significant use of reinsurance. As our capital base has grown, new opportunities have emerged for us. Of particular note, in 2019, A.M. Best upgraded our insurance companies from an "A-" to an "A" (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) financial strength rating, which we believe differentiates us in the markets in which we operate. As we continue to grow, we believe that we will have the opportunity to access additional business and to retain more profitable business that we have historically ceded to the reinsurance markets.
Maintaining our focus on long-term profitability and growth. Our competitive advantages, including our focus on underserved markets, have enabled us to grow our gross written premiums to $651.3 million for 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 24.0% since 2015, while maintaining an average return on equity of approximately 14% and an average adjusted return on equity of approximately 15% for the same time period. As we seek to grow our business, we remain disciplined in targeting classes of business and markets where we believe we can generate attractive returns. Rather than make decisions based on where we are in the market cycle, we focus on selecting high-quality programs, only pursuing opportunities that we expect to meet our pricing and risk requirements over the long-term. We will not participate in markets where we do not believe our business model can add incremental risk-adjusted value.
Maintain disciplined controls over our key business risks. In order to maintain our underwriting profitability, we have systematic underwriting and risk monitoring processes across our business. We believe our risk management is enhanced by the fact that we provide multiple services to many of our Program Partners and thus are in regular communication with them regarding underwriting, claims handling, reinsurance placement and collateral management. We seek to swiftly identify, correct and, if necessary, terminate relationships with Program Partners that are not producing targeted underwriting results, writing exposures outside of agreed upon risk tolerances or not meeting their collateral or other commitments to us.

Products and services
We have historically provided products and services to our target markets in the specialty casualty insurance market. We underwrite specialty casualty insurance products both through our Program Partners, programs where we partner with other organizations, and our Owned MGAs. Our insurance product offerings include workers’ compensation, other liability, accident and health, and other lines of business. We also provide our Program Partners with a variety of services from which we generate recurring fee-based revenues, including reinsurance brokerage and, in particular, issuing carrier or "fronting" services.

Workers’ compensation
We offer workers’ compensation insurance through both our Owned MGAs and our Program Partners. California, Florida and Arizona represented 35.5%, 7.5% and 7.0%, respectively, of our workers’ compensation gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 41.5%, 5.3% and 6.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. We write business across a variety of industries and hazard classes. The construction industry is our largest industry exposure, representing 23% of premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2022. The workers’ compensation insurance industry classifies risks into hazard groups defined by the National Council on Compensation Insurance, or NCCI, and based on severity, with employers in lower groups having lower cost claims. Our premiums are spread across hazard classes. We target accounts that we believe offer greater risk-adjusted returns, such as small accounts that are less subject to competition, or accounts with high experience modification factors that our underwriters assess to be attractively priced for the potential risk. Experience modification factors are determined by state insurance regulators based on the insured’s historical loss experience.
We do not write accounts that we believe present exposure to catastrophic risk. The average workers’ compensation premium per policy written by us was $15,539 and $14,779 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We manage workers’ compensation claims administration for all of our Owned MGAs and for several of our Program Partners. We believe that our claims philosophy has been a key differentiating factor allowing us to maintain lower loss ratios and settle claims quickly. Our workers’ compensation programs are supported by various quota share and excess of loss reinsurance facilities, which we utilize to align risk with our Program Partners and optimize our net retention relative to our financial objectives, balance sheet size and ratings requirements. We ceded 39.8% and 57.6% of gross workers’ compensation premiums earned to third-party insurers for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The following exhibits illustrate our business mix of workers’ compensation gross written premiums by industry and hazard class for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Other liability
We offer other liability insurance products through both our Owned MGAs and our Program Partners. We target segments of the market that we believe are underserved or mispriced, such as California contractors with an average of five employees.
The other liability products that we offer through our Owned MGAs include admitted general liability and construction defect products offered to small contractors that protect them against claims from third parties. We distribute these products through select wholesale brokers in California. Additionally, through several of our Program Partners, we write 11 other liability insurance products in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Our claims personnel administer claims for our Owned MGA other liability products. We ceded approximately 76.9% and 79.1% of our gross other liability premiums earned to third-party insurers for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Issuing carrier services
We provide issuing carrier services to several of our Program Partners who offer workers' compensation, commercial multi-peril, personal auto and commercial auto and other liability insurance. In these relationships, we act as the policy-issuing insurance carrier for our Program Partner and transfer all or a substantial portion of the underwriting risk to third-party reinsurers. When we enter into issuing carrier relationships, we typically receive reinsurance ceding commissions at rates that include our fronting service from our reinsurers who are both Program Partners and/or third-party reinsurers. Reinsurance ceding commissions vary based on the line of business and premium volume. We provide issuing carrier services across each of our insurance products. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, reinsurance ceding commissions from issuing carrier services were $77.6 million, $86.9 million and $71.8 million, respectively, and are recognized as a reduction of direct insurance commission expense within 'General and administrative expenses' in the consolidated statement of operations.
Reinsurance brokerage services
Our reinsurance brokerage services division provides reinsurance placement, servicing and renewal services to small- to mid-sized insurance organizations, including most of our Program Partners and additional third-party insurance organizations. We earn commissions for structuring and placing reinsurance coverage on behalf of our clients. Commissions are based on a percentage of premiums ceded to reinsurers and vary by type or complexity of reinsurance coverage. Our reinsurance brokerage services are a valuable risk management tool in our relationships with our Program Partners, as we typically require the use of our reinsurance brokerage services to place and structure reinsurance prior to the inception of a new program. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, reinsurance brokerage generated $5.7 million, $7.0 million and $9.0 million in revenue, which is included in Other revenue.
Other services
We provide a variety of other services to insurance organizations, including claims administration and insurance management services. We provide workers’ compensation insurance claims administration services to some of our Program Partners as well as to third-party insurance organizations with which we do not have additional relationships.
Inland marine
Inland marine underwrites coverage for property that may be held in transit or instrumentalities of transportation and communication, such as builders risk, contractors equipment, transportation risk and mobile equipment.
Marketing and distribution
We market and distribute our products through several channels. Our Owned MGAs market through both retail agents and wholesale brokers, and our reinsurance brokerage services division actively markets our services directly to prospective clients. Additionally, we distribute products and services to our Program Partners, which comprise program administrators and insurance carriers. Since we focus on smaller accounts, we do not market our products and services through large insurance brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Owned MGAs represented 37% of our gross written premiums, Program Partners represented 62% of gross written premiums and national insurance pools represented 1% of gross written premiums. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Owned MGAs represented 42% of our gross written premiums, Program Partners represented 57% of gross written premiums and national insurance pools represented 1% of gross written premiums. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Owned MGA's represented 59% of our gross written premiums, Program Partners represented 40% of gross written premiums and national insurance pools represented 1% of gross written premiums. 
Retail agents
We distribute our Owned MGA workers’ compensation products through approximately 300 retail agents. We target retail agents with experience and distribution capabilities in our target markets. Retail agents must demonstrate an ability to produce both our desired quality and quantity of business. To assist with this goal, our underwriters regularly visit our retail brokers to market and discuss the products we offer. We terminate retail agents who are unable to produce consistently profitable business or who produce unacceptably low volumes of business.
Wholesale brokers
We distribute our other liability products underwritten by our Owned MGAs through wholesale brokers that have expertise and strong track records in our niche target markets. For these products, we target small contractors in California. We use wholesale brokers to distribute these products because wholesale brokers are an important channel for commercial insurance products where they control much of the premium in these segments. We select our wholesale brokers based on our management’s review of their experience, knowledge, business plan, and track record of delivering us profitable business.
Reinsurance brokerage services
Our reinsurance brokerage services division actively markets our reinsurance services to small- and mid- sized program administrators and other insurance organizations. The primary focus of our reinsurance brokerage services division is to place reinsurance for our program partners, direct business and third parties. We are also able to leverage our reinsurance brokerage relationships to cultivate new Program Partner relationships and market our other services. The majority of our current Program Partner relationships originated as an introduction from our reinsurance brokerage services division.
Program administrators
We partner with select program administrators across each of our target markets to harness the efficiency and scale of these organizations’ marketing and distribution infrastructures. Through these relationships, we are able to access national distribution channels or write specialized risks in our target markets efficiently. Generally, policies bound by our program administrators are underwritten according to strict underwriting guidelines that we establish with each program administrator. We have long relationships with many of our program administrators and, in most cases, we have had an existing relationship with a program administrator before adding it as a new Program Partner. For example, we may have previously provided the program with reinsurance placement or consulting services, or worked with the key principals of the prospective Program Partner at their prior organization. We believe program administrators value our multi-service offering and capabilities and the flexibility with which we can offer these services. In addition to underwriting insurance products through program administrators, we provide these organizations with issuing carrier services and reinsurance brokerage services. 
Carrier and other partnerships
Given our unique focus on flexible multi-service offerings, we are a partner of choice for small- to mid-sized insurance carriers seeking a specialty casualty insurance partner to satisfy insurance department requirements, provide comprehensive management solutions or transfer certain classes of risk. We have partnerships with insurance companies, risk retention groups, trusts and state insurance pools. 
Program selection, underwriting and controls
Program selection
Given our position and reputation in the market, we are presented with more new program opportunities than we choose to write, allowing us to be highly selective with respect to the Program Partners with whom we choose to partner. We decline approximately 94% of the new opportunities we are presented with prior to or through our pre-screening process. We typically source new opportunities through our reinsurance brokerage services business or through referrals from existing Program Partners. For each new opportunity that we choose to evaluate, we conduct a comprehensive pre-screening of the company, including an evaluation of its philosophy, size, past performance, future performance targets and above all, compatibility with our operating model, risk appetite and existing book of business. Our target Program Partners tend to have several, if not all, of the following traits:
•small- to mid-sized books of business (less than $30 million of annual gross premiums at the inception of the relationship);
•presence in markets where we believe we can leverage our distinctive expertise, multi-service offering and market relationships to create a competitive advantage;
•track record of underwriting success supported with credible data;
•proven ability to administer the program pursuant to agreed-upon underwriting and claims guidelines;
•ability and willingness to assume a meaningful quota share risk participation in the program, typically through ownership of an insurance company or captive;
•collaborative, entrepreneurial management team; and
•willingness and ability for us to control the structuring and placement of reinsurance.
Underwriting and program design
For opportunities that are acceptable to us through the pre-screening process, we conduct rigorous underwriting due diligence prior to entering into a partnership. As part of this process, our due diligence team collects and analyzes data relating to the organization’s operating, underwriting, financial and biographical information to prepare an initial due diligence file for our Underwriting Committee. Our Underwriting Committee is led by our CEO and consists of members with expertise in underwriting and finance. In 2022, 7 out of 118 submissions were approved by the Underwriting Committee. If the Underwriting Committee approves the submission on a provisional basis, we then conduct comprehensive underwriting, claims and financial diligence on the potential Program Partner. This includes inviting the potential Program Partner’s management for an on-site meeting at our Wayzata headquarters and on-site diligence of the potential Program Partner.
If we look to enter into a contractual relationship with a potential Program Partner, we work with them to design a program that appropriately aligns interests and establish rigorous underwriting guidelines and ongoing reporting and auditing requirements. At the inception of a new program, we typically act as an issuing carrier where we reinsure a substantial amount of risk to third parties. We also typically require the Program Partner to maintain significant underwriting risk or otherwise align incentives with the Program Partner’s underwriting performance. The amount of risk and premiums ceded to Program Partners is contractually stipulated with each Program Partner. Over time we look to optimize our net retention positions with our Program Partners once we have become comfortable with their performance through our ongoing interactions.
Ongoing monitoring and controls
Throughout the lifetime of a relationship with a Program Partner, we maintain systematic monitoring and control mechanisms to ensure each relationship meets our financial objectives. We closely monitor each Program Partner’s adherence to the agreed upon underwriting and claims guidelines and conduct regular reviews of loss experience, rate levels, reserves and the overall financial health of the Program Partner. We receive underwriting and claims data feeds from each Program Partner at least monthly. We typically conduct two underwriting, claims and accounting audits per program per year. Because we typically provide multiple services to our Program Partners, we are in regular communication with them regarding underwriting, claims handling, reinsurance placement and collateral management. As a result, we have near continuous opportunities to interact with our Program Partners and evaluate their performance.
We maintain the right to terminate relationships with our Program Partners. Reasons for us to terminate a relationship include an inability to produce targeted underwriting results, writing exposures outside of agreed upon risk tolerances, delinquency in 
meeting reporting requirements, a change of strategic direction, or failure to meet collateral or other commitments to us. Our stringent and extensive due diligence and selection process allows us the flexibility to partner with organizations with which we believe we will have successful relationships. 
Claims
We actively manage claims for our Owned MGA businesses, as well as for select Program Partners that underwrite workers’ compensation insurance. Other lines of business are typically managed directly by our Program Partners, or in some cases by TPAs. When our Program Partners or TPAs administer claims, our claims personnel are responsible for overseeing the Program Partner or TPA, including the management of loss reserves, settlement, arbitration and mediation. Claims are reported directly to the applicable Program Partner or TPA, which adheres to agreed-upon service level standards.
For business where we manage the claims, our experienced claims team actively manages the claims. In our largest line of business, workers’ compensation, our philosophy is to provide an injured employee with high-quality medical care as quickly as possible to reduce pain, expedite healing and lead to a faster and more complete recovery. Once an injured employee has healed, we aim to fully settle and achieve a full and complete release of the claim at the earliest opportunity. This approach to claims management enables us to lower our claim costs and settle the ultimate claim reserves more quickly. In order to achieve these outcomes, we manage our claims organization to ensure that each of our claims personnel is responsible for lower than industry average claims files per claims adjuster.
Our claims adjusters have settlement authority that varies by the line of business and the experience of each adjuster. In the case of a catastrophic claim, we may use a third-party administrator that specializes in these types of claims to ease the burden of catastrophic claims on our organization. In addition, our claims examiners work closely with our underwriting staff to keep apprised of claims trends. Vendor management is also an important component of effective claims management and our claims examiners work closely with our vendors to manage expenses and costs.
Reinsurance
We cede a portion of the risk we accept on our balance sheet to third-party reinsurers through a variety of reinsurance arrangements. We manage these arrangements to align risks with our Program Partners, optimize our net retention relative to our financial objectives, balance sheet size and ratings requirements, as well as to limit our maximum loss resulting from a single program or a single event. We utilize both quota share and excess of loss ("XOL") reinsurance as tools in our overall risk management strategy to achieve these goals, usually in conjunction with each other. Quota share reinsurance involves the proportional sharing of premiums and losses of each defined program. We utilize quota share reinsurance for several purposes, including (i) to cede risk to Program Partners, which allows us to share economics and align incentives and (ii) to cede risk to third-party reinsurers in order to manage our net written premiums appropriately based on our financial objectives, capital base, A.M. Best financial strength rating and risk appetite. It is a core pillar of our underwriting philosophy that Program Partners retain a portion of the underwriting risk of their program. We believe this best aligns interests, attracts higher quality programs and leads to better underwriting results. Under XOL reinsurance, losses in excess of a retention level are paid by the reinsurer, subject to a limit, and are customized per program or across multiple programs. We utilize XOL reinsurance to protect against catastrophic or other unforeseen extreme loss activity that could otherwise negatively impact our profitability and capital base. The majority of our exposure to catastrophic risk stems from the workers' compensation premium we retain. Potential catastrophic events include an earthquake, terrorism or another event. We believe we mitigate risk by our focus on small-to mid-sized accounts, which means that we generally do not have concentrated employee counts at a single location that could be exposed to a catastrophic loss. The cost and limits of the reinsurance coverage we purchase vary from year to year based on the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and our desired level of retention.
Our workers' compensation XOL reinsurance structure consolidates multiple programs under a single XOL reinsurance program comprised of two excess of loss reinsurance agreements with five professional reinsurers. We believe this structure significantly decreases our cost of reinsurance compared with each program maintaining its own XOL reinsurance program. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2 million retention of which is reinsured under various quota share reinsurance agreements at a weighted average rate of 21%, based on 2022 premiums for the applicable programs. These agreements apply to programs that accounted for 87% of workers' compensation premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have the following XOL coverage:
•0% of $8 million of losses in excess of $2 million as of December 31, 2022. Gross written premiums for the applicable programs for this layer accounted for 74% of workers' compensation premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022.
•100% of $5 million of losses in excess of $10 million. Gross written premiums for the applicable programs for this layer accounted for 74% of workers' compensation premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
•100% of $35 million of losses in excess of $15 million. Gross written premiums for the applicable programs for this layer accounted for 87% of workers' compensation premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Collateral management
As a result of our extensive use of reinsurance in our business model, we effectively convert underwriting risk to credit risk of our Program Partners and other professional reinsurers. Accordingly, it is critical for the success of our business that we actively manage our credit exposures. We achieve this through active collateral management, including: (i) requiring our reinsurance partners who do not have an A.M. Best financial strength rating of "A-" or higher or who are not authorized 
reinsurers to post collateral equal to at least 100% of reserves for unearned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expense, including incurred but not yet reported ("IBNR") reserves, based on our assessment of expected losses; (ii) securing collateral by trust funds, letters of credit or, more frequently, funds withheld accounts; and (iii) reviewing collateral accounts on a monthly basis and secured with quarterly and annual "true-ups."
As of December 31, 2022, we had reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses of $408.5 million. Against these recoverables, we maintained $241.3 million of funds withheld and $155.4 million of other forms of collateral, for a total of approximately $396.7 million in credit protection from our reinsurers. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any balance from reinsurers that was over 90 days old or in dispute, and we held appropriate funding or collateral from all unauthorized reinsurers. 
The following table sets forth our ten largest reinsurance recoverables by reinsurer as of December 31, 2022, in thousands:

Technology
We operate on a digital platform with a data warehouse that collects and builds a robust repository of statistical data for our workers’ compensation business and a substantial amount of our other liability business. All of our workers’ compensation business data is automated through the data warehouse. Our platform provides a high degree of efficiency, accuracy and speed across all of our processes. We are able to use the data that we collect through Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs") to quickly analyze trends across all functions in our business. The data warehouse is easily searchable and contains most of the underwriting and claims information we collect at every level. We are able to track rates, monitor historical loss experience and reserve development and measure other relevant metrics at a granular level of detail. Our technology team is continuously enhancing this system to improve its capability and expand its use across our business. We believe our systems and technology allow us to quickly collect and analyze data, thereby improving our ability to manage our business. We have scalable, standardized infrastructure technology systems built for automation, efficiency and security, and are not burdened by legacy technology systems.
Reserves
We record reserves for estimated losses of the policies that we underwrite and for loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for losses and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid as of a given point in time. We evaluate the overall adequacy of gross, ceded and net losses and LAE reserves in accordance with established actuarial standards to set our reserves. We establish reserves on a line of business basis at the individual program level. Consistent with our gross and net premium breakdown, reserves for workers’ compensation losses comprise the majority of our carried reserve position. 
Due to our shorter claims process and ability to close claims faster than competitors, we believe we are able to settle our ultimate reserves more quickly as well.
When a claim is first reported, we establish an initial case reserve for the estimated amount of our loss based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time. Generally, a case reserve is established within 30 days after the claim is reported and consists of anticipated medical costs, indemnity costs and specific adjustment expenses. This case reserve is set to cover the life of the claim based on information available at that point in time. At any point in time, the amount paid on a claim, as well as the reserve for future amounts to be paid, represents the estimated total cost of the claim or the case incurred amount. The estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based on various factors, including:
•type of loss;
•severity of the injury or damage;
•age and occupation of the injured employee;
•estimated length of temporary disability;
•anticipated permanent disability;
•expected medical procedures, costs and duration;
•our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;
•insurance policy provisions, including coverage, related to the claim;
•jurisdiction of the occurrence; and
•other benefits defined by applicable statute.
Reserves are estimates involving actuarial projections of the expected ultimate cost to settle and administer claims at a given time but are not expected to precisely represent the ultimate liability. Estimates are based on past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Such estimates are also based on facts and circumstances then known but are subject to significant uncertainty based on the outcome of various factors, such as future events, future trends in claim severity, inflation and changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage.
Reserves are set by our Reserve Committee in consultation with an independent third-party actuarial firm. Our Reserve Committee includes our Chief Executive Officer and President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Actuary Officer, Senior Vice President of Underwriting, Corporate Controller and Insurance Divisional Controller. The Reserve Committee meets quarterly to review the actuarial reserving recommendations made by the independent actuary. Our independent third-party actuarial firm reviews our net reserves at March 31, June 30 and September 30 of each year and performs a comprehensive review of all programs at each year-end.
As of December 31, 2022 we have had aggregate favorable development of $37.6 million on our reserve estimates since 2015, respectively.

Investments
Investment income is a significant component of our earnings. We invest our reserves and maintain a conservative investment portfolio primarily comprised of highly rated fixed income securities. Our investment strategy is to preserve capital and limit our exposure to investment risk. Our portfolio is managed by New England Asset Management, Inc. ("NEAM"), an investment management firm with a focus on insurance portfolios. Under our current agreement with NEAM, which we can terminate at any time upon 30 days’ notice, we pay NEAM a quarterly fee of a percentage of our assets under management. There are no minimum amounts of assets required under our agreement with NEAM. Our Investment Committee meets periodically and reports to our board of directors.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $454.0 million of total cash and invested assets, net of all collateral held on behalf of our Program Partners under reinsurance treaties. The weighted average rating of the fixed income portfolio is "AA" and the weighted average duration is approximately 4.2 years. The fixed income portfolio pre-tax book yield was 3.07%.
We hold funds withheld balances in separate accounts for the benefit of our Program Partners. The funds withheld assets and associated investment income belong to our various Program Partners. However, we require that the assets in these accounts be managed in accordance with our investment guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, we had $241.3 million of funds held under reinsurance treaties.

Enterprise risk management
We designed and implemented an enterprise risk management ("ERM") program to identify, manage and mitigate the risks the company is exposed to. The board of directors and its committees are supported in their oversight of our ERM process by an ERM Committee consisting of seven senior executives who each represent a critical operating unit of ours.
Our board of directors, ERM committee and senior management have identified five key risk areas for oversight within the ERM framework. The five key risk areas are credit risk, market risk, underwriting risk, strategic risk and operational risk. Within each key risk, we have identified specific risk sub-categories leading to the identification and analysis of more granular risks. Through a documented analytical process, the ERM committee continually reviews and evaluates these risks to monitor their potential impact on our businesses and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors and its committees. Our board of directors believes this overall structure and analytical process creates effective risk identification, appetite determination, controls, oversight and management for our Company.
Competition
In general, the property and casualty ("P&C") insurance market is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and management resources and experience than we do. We may also compete with new market entrants in the future. In the workers’ compensation insurance market, our competitors include insurance companies, state insurance pools and self-insurance funds. According to the most recent market data from S&P Global, approximately 250 insurance companies participated in the workers’ compensation market in 2021. We compete against State National Companies, Inc. and AF Group in the provision of issuing carrier services to program administrators.
Competition is based on many factors, including the reputation and experience of the insurer, coverages and services offered, pricing and other terms and conditions, speed of claims payment, customer service, relationships with brokers and agents (including ease of doing business, service provided and commission rates paid), size and financial strength ratings, among other considerations.
Ratings
As of March 2023, we have an "A" (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) financial strength rating ("FSR") from A.M. Best, which rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders. A.M. Best’s FSRs reflect its opinion of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders.
A.M. Best currently assigns 16 FSRs to insurance companies, which currently range from "A++" (Superior) to "S" (Rating Suspended). "A" (Excellent) is the third highest FSR in the A.M. Best system. In evaluating a company’s financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews the company’s profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its losses 
and loss expense reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure, the experience and competence of its management and its market presence.
Human capital
Overview
As of December 31, 2022, we had 344 employees. Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such an agreement. We believe that our employee relationships are good.
Compensation and benefits
We believe that our employees are one of our most valuable assets. In order to attract and retain talent, we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits to support our team members’ overall well-being. Employee compensation includes base pay, annual incentive compensation and, in some cases, stock compensation.
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment free from discrimination of any kind and that supports the communities we serve. We seek to recruit the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.
Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at both the state and federal level, including regulation under state insurance and federal laws. We cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on our business. Future laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Insurance regulation - General
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the states in which they are domiciled, particularly with respect to their financial condition. Benchmark is domiciled in Kansas where it is regulated and supervised by the Kansas Insurance Department. Additionally, Benchmark is commercially domiciled in California, where it is regulated and supervised by the California Department of Insurance. ALIC is domiciled in Utah where it is regulated and supervised by the Utah Insurance Department. 7710 is domiciled in South Carolina where it is regulated and supervised by the South Carolina Department of Insurance. BSIC is domiciled in Arkansas where it is regulated and supervised by the Arkansas Department of Insurance. Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by all states in which they transact business, which oversight in practice often focuses on review of their market conduct. Benchmark is licensed to conduct insurance business and subject to regulation and supervision in 49 states and the District of Columbia. ALIC is licensed or eligible to conduct insurance business and therefore is subject to regulation and supervision by insurance regulators in 38 states and the District of Columbia. 7710 is licensed or eligible to conduct insurance business and is subject to regulation and supervision by insurance regulators in nine states. BSIC is licensed to conduct business in one state and is authorized to issue policies in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The extent and scope of insurance regulation varies among jurisdictions, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial security of insurers, including admittance of assets for purposes of calculating statutory surplus, standards of solvency, reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy and the business conduct of insurers.
In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and, for certain lines of insurance, the approval of rates. State statutes and regulations also prescribe the permitted types and concentrations of investments by insurers. The primary purpose of this insurance industry regulation is to protect policyholders. P&C insurance companies are required to file detailed quarterly and annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or eligible to do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. In connection with the continued licensing of insurance companies, regulators have discretionary authority to limit or prohibit the ability to issue new policies if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that an insurer is not maintaining minimum statutory surplus or capital or if the further transaction of business will be detrimental to its policyholders.
The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay in any twelve-month period, without prior approval by their respective domestic insurance regulators, is restricted under the laws of Kansas, Utah, Arkansas and South Carolina.
Under Kansas and California law, dividends payable from Benchmark without the prior approval of the applicable insurance commissioner must not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of Benchmark’s surplus as shown on the last statutory financial statement on file with the Kansas Insurance Department; or (ii) 100% of net income during the applicable twelve-month period (not including realized gains). Dividends shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of Benchmark's own securities.
Under Utah law, dividends payable from ALIC without the prior approval of the applicable insurance commissioner must not exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of ALIC’s surplus as shown on the last statutory financial statement on file with the Utah Insurance Department; or (ii) 100% of net income during the applicable twelve- month period (not including realized gains). Dividends shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of ALIC's own securities.
Under South Carolina law, dividends payable from 7710 without the prior approval of the applicable insurance commissioner are limited to the following during the preceding twelve months: (a) when paid from other than earned surplus must not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of 7710's surplus as regards policyholders as shown in 7710’s most recent annual statement; or (ii) the net income, not including net realized gains or losses as shown in the 7710's most recent annual statement; or (b) when paid from earned surplus must not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of the 7710's surplus as regards policyholders as shown in 7710’s most recent annual statement; or (ii) the net income, not including net realized gains or losses as shown in the 7710's most recent annual statement. Dividends shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of 7710’s own securities.
Under Arkansas law, dividends payable from BSIC without the prior approval of the applicable insurance commissioner must not exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of BSIC’s surplus as shown on the last statutory financial statement on file with the Arkansas Insurance Department; or (ii) 100% of net income during the applicable twelve- month period (not including realized gains). Dividends shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of BSIC's own securities.
In addition, payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of our insurance subsidiaries’ respective jurisdictions requiring that each insurance subsidiary hold a specified amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on its outstanding policies. These regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations, giving consideration for required future premiums to be received, which are based on certain specified interest rates and methods of valuation, which are subject to change.
Insurance holding company regulation
We are an insurance holding company and, together with our insurance subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, are subject to the insurance holding company system laws of Kansas, California, Utah, Arkansas and South Carolina. These laws vary across jurisdictions, but generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the jurisdiction’s insurance regulatory authorities, to file reports disclosing certain information, including their capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, enterprise risk and own risk and solvency assessment.
These laws also require disclosure of certain qualifying transactions between or among our insurance subsidiaries and us or any of our other subsidiaries or affiliates to which one or more of our insurance subsidiaries is a party. Such transactions could include loans, investments, sales, service agreements and reinsurance agreements among other similar inter-affiliate transactions. These laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable. In certain circumstances, the insurance company must give prior notice of the transaction to the insurance department in its state of domicile, and the insurance department must either approve or disapprove the subject inter-company transaction within defined periods. Further, these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and its financial needs.
The insurance holding company laws in some states, including Kansas, California, Utah, Arkansas and South Carolina, require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s parent company. Generally, to obtain approval from the insurance commissioner for any acquisition of control of an insurance company or its parent company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing certain information including with respect to the participant companies in and terms of the transaction. Different jurisdictions may have requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of any insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized 
to transact business in those jurisdictions. Additional requirements may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control.
Credit for reinsurance
State insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws. The Nonadmitted Reinsurance Reform Act contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") provides that if the state of domicile of a ceding insurer is a National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") accredited state, or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar to the requirements necessary for NAIC accreditation, and recognizes credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk, then no other state may deny such credit for reinsurance. Because all states are currently accredited by the NAIC, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a state in which a U.S. ceding insurer is licensed but not domiciled from denying credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk if the cedant’s domestic state regulator recognizes credit for reinsurance. The ceding company in this instance is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company’s liability for unearned premium (which are that portion of written premiums which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period), loss reserves and loss expense reserves to the extent ceded to the reinsurer.
Statutory examinations
We are required to file detailed quarterly and annual financial statements, in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules with regulatory officials in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, the Kansas Insurance Department, the California Department of Insurance, the Utah Insurance Department, the Arkansas Department of Insurance, and the South Carolina Department of Insurance conduct periodic detailed examinations, generally once every three to five years, of the books, records, accounts and operations of our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in their states.
Financial tests
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or "tests," known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System or IRIS, which is designed for early identification of companies that may require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance companies submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data by utilizing ratios. State insurance regulators review this statistical report, which is available to the public, together with an analytical report, prepared by and available only to state insurance regulators, to identify insurance companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. A "usual range" of results for each ratio is used as a benchmark.
Risk-based capital requirements
In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements for P&C insurers. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantively similar law. The NAIC Risk-Based Capital Model Act requires insurance companies to submit an annual RBC Report, which compares an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital with its Authorized Control Level RBC. A company’s RBC is calculated by using a specified formula that applies factors to various specified asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. The factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with less underlying risk.
Total Adjusted Capital is defined as the sum of an insurer’s statutory capital and surplus and asset valuation reserve and the estimated amount of all dividends declared by the insurer’s board of directors prior to the end of the statement year that are not yet paid or due at the end of the year. The RBC Report is used by regulators to initiate appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show indications of weak or deteriorating conditions. RBC is an additional standard for minimum capital requirements that insurers must meet to avoid being placed in rehabilitation or liquidation by regulators. The annual RBC Report, and the information contained therein, are not intended by the NAIC as a means to rank insurers.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile. It provides a means of setting the capital requirement in which the degree of risk taken by the insurer is the primary determinant. The value of an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital in relation to its RBC, together with its trend in its Total Adjusted Capital, is used as a basis for determining regulatory action that a state insurance regulator may be authorized or required to take with respect to an insurer. The four determinations, potentially applicable under each jurisdiction’s laws are as follows:
•Company Action Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is greater than or equal to 150% but less than 200% of RBC, or Total Adjusted Capital is greater than or equal to 200% but less than 250% of RBC and has a negative trend. If there 
is a Company Action Level Event, the insurer must submit a plan (an "RBC Plan") outlining, among other things, the corrective actions it intends to take in order to remedy its capital deficiency.
•Regulatory Action Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is greater than or equal to 100% but less than 150% of RBC or the insurer has failed to comply with filing deadlines for its RBC Report or RBC Plan. If there is a Regulatory Action Level Event, the insurer is also required to submit an RBC Plan. In addition, the insurance regulator must undertake a comprehensive examination of the insurer’s financial condition and must issue any appropriate corrective orders.
•Authorized Control Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is below RBC but greater than or equal to 70% of RBC or the insurer has failed to respond to a corrective order. As noted above, if there is an Authorized Control Level Event, the insurance regulator may seek rehabilitation or liquidation of the insurer if it deems it to be in the best interests of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer and the public.
•Mandatory Control Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is below 70% of RBC. If there is a Mandatory Control Level Event, the insurance regulator must seek rehabilitation or liquidation of the insurer.
Market conduct
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic market conduct exams ("MCE") in any jurisdiction where they do business. An MCE typically entails review of business activities, such as operations and management, complaint handling, marketing and sales, producer licensing, policyholder service, underwriting and rating and claims handling. Regulators may impose fines and penalties upon finding violations of regulations governing such business activities.
Rate and form approvals
Our insurance subsidiaries may be subject to each state’s laws and regulations regarding rate and form approvals. The applicable laws and regulations are used by states to establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. An insurer’s ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process can be dependent upon each state’s respective requirements.
Claims adjusting
Generally, insurance companies, adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices. Unfair claims practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions; failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies; and attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled.
Assessments against insurers
Under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state and the District of Columbia., licensed insurers can be assessed by insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Most of these laws provide for annual limits on the assessments and for an offset against state premium taxes. These premium tax offsets must be spread over future periods ranging from five to 20 years. Since these assessments typically are not made for several years after an insurer fails and depend upon the final outcome of liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings, we cannot accurately determine the amount or timing of any future assessments.
Regulation of investments
We are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amounts of investments in certain asset categories, such as below-investment grade fixed income securities, equity real estate, other equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these requirements and limitations could cause affected investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, could require the divestiture of such non-qualifying investments.
Statutory accounting principles
Statutory accounting principles ("SAP") are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s solvency. Statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.
GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, but is also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.
Potential issuing carrier restrictions
In certain states, including Florida and Kentucky, the Insurance Commissioner has the authority to prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer. In addition, insurance departments in states that have no statutory or regulatory prohibition against an authorized insurer acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance business without a license and the issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance.
Enterprise risk and other developments
The NAIC, as part of its solvency modernization initiative, has engaged in a concerted effort to strengthen the ability of U.S. state insurance regulators to monitor U.S. insurance holding company groups. The NAIC’s solvency modernization initiative, among other things, aims to expand the authority and focus of state insurance regulators to encompass U.S. insurance holding company systems at the group level.
The holding company reform efforts at the NAIC culminated in December 2010 in the adoption of significant amendments to the NAIC’s Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the "Model Holding Company Act") and its Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation (the "Model Holding Company Regulation"). Among other things, the revised Model Holding Company Act and Model Holding Company Regulation explicitly address "enterprise" risk – the risk that an activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer will, if not remedied promptly, be likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole – and require annual reporting of potential enterprise risk as well as access to information to allow the state insurance regulator to assess such risk. In addition, the Model Holding Company Act amendments include a requirement to the effect that any person divesting control over an insurer must provide 30 days’ notice to the regulator and the insurer (with an exception for cases where a Form A is being filed). The amendments direct the domestic state insurance regulator to determine those instances in which a divesting person will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. Some form of the 2010 amendments to the Model Holding Company Act has been adopted in all states.
In December 2014, the NAIC adopted additional revisions to the Model Holding Company Act, updating the model to clarify the group-wide supervisor for a defined class of internationally active insurance groups. The revisions also outline the process for determining the lead state for domestic insurance groups, outline the activities the commissioner may engage in as group-wide supervisor and extend confidentiality protections to cover information received in the course of group-wide supervision. The 2014 revisions to the Model Holding Company Act have been adopted in all accredited U.S. jurisdictions.
In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") Model Act, which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer’s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and the insurance group of which it is a member. If and when the ORSA Model Act is adopted by a particular state, the ORSA Model Act would impose more extensive filing requirements on parents and other affiliates of domestic insurers. Each of Kansas, California and Utah have adopted their version of the ORSA Model Act. Our insurance company subsidiaries, Benchmark, ALIC and 7710, will be subject to the requirements of the ORSA Model Act adopted in Kansas, California, Utah and South Carolina, respectively, when their direct written premiums and unaffiliated assumed premiums, if any, exceed $500 million (Benchmark, ALIC and 7710 are currently exempt from such requirements based on the amount of their direct written premiums and unaffiliated assumed premiums).
Privacy regulation
Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health- related and customer information and their 
practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate the use and disclosure of social security numbers and federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information.
Cybersecurity regulation
The NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law in October 2017. As of the date of this Annual Report, 18 states, including South Carolina but not including Kansas, California, Arkansas or Utah, have adopted the model law or a variation of it. We expect that additional regulations could be enacted in other jurisdictions that could impact our cybersecurity program. Depending on these and other potential implementation requirements, we will likely incur additional costs of compliance.
