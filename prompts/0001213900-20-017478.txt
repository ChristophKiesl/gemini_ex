Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
We are primarily engaged in acquiring and exploring mineral properties plus the development of mineral resources for mining with the intent of applying green innovation plus renewable energy and technology to traditional mining methods.
 
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2005, under the name “Nava Resources, Inc.” for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration activities. We were authorized to issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, having a par value of $0.001 per share. On January 4, 2007, we obtained written consent from our shareholders to amend our Articles of Incorporation to change the par value of our common stock from $0.001 to $0.00001 per share, which change was effected on February 28, 2007. Effective July 30, 2013, we changed our name from “Nava Resources, Inc.” to “Blox Inc.”.

Recent Developments
 
Recently Discontinued Projects
 
Mansounia:
 
Our former Mansounia exploration permit was acquired in 2013 and was secured based on our technical and financial capabilities to obtain a mining permit. The 2013 exploration permit was near expiration when acquired and was subsequently renewed for the maximum of four times permitted by the Guinea Mining Code. In December 2019, the company submitted its final mining permit proposal to the Ministry of Mines. The ministry requested, in its discretion, that we provide evidence of funding to account for 15% of the capital required for project financing. The company was unable to secure the required financing during prior to expiration of the final permit extension, and the permit was withdrawn by decree from the Ministry of Mines. Although it is our understanding the Ministry of Mines exercises considerable discretion regarding the extension and revocation of permits and the grant of mining licenses, the decree to revoke our exploration permit suggests that our application is no longer under consideration. With respect to the fate of the project, we anticipate that we will attempt to renegotiate a position for the Mansounia project once Guinea reopens its border to international travel (the country has been inaccessible due to COVID-19) Currently the a permit for the property has been granted by way of two exploration licence to Penta Goldfields SARL, a company owned by our In country manager in Guinea, Mr. Nfamoussa Kaba. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in securing any future rights to the Mansounia project.
Current Business: 
 
Pramkese, Osenase and Asamankese, Ghana, West Africa
 
On June 22, 2013, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Waratah Investments Limited (“Waratah”) whereby we agreed to purchase all of Waratah’s right, title, and interest in the Quivira Gold (“Quivira”) shares, of which Waratah holds 100% of the outstanding shares. As consideration for the Quivira shares, we agreed to issue to Waratah 60,000,000 shares of common stock and 60,000,000 warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share at $0.05 for a period of five years from the closing date. Quivira, a subsidiary of Waratah, owns and operates gold and diamond mining properties in Ghana.
 
The closing of the agreement was subject to the completion of a private placement financing of up to US$1,500,000, which private placement was completed in April 2018. We issued 30,000,000 units (the “Units”) at a price of US$0.05 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of US$1,500,000. US$1,100,000 of the proceeds were advanced as non-interest bearing loans since 2014 and were utilized to cover general and administrative expenses, as well as to carry out exploration work on our mineral properties. The remaining balance of US$400,000 was received by April 2018. Each Unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one additional common share at a price of $0.05 per share for a term of five years from the date of issuance.
 
Closing the Agreement is also conditional upon receiving legal opinions of Ghana counsel confirming various matters relating to the laws of Ghana, including corporate and title opinions; the Company receiving legal opinions of Australian counsel confirming various matters relating to the laws of Australia, including corporate and title opinions; completion of certain ongoing transactions by Quivira relating to the transfer of title to certain assets and to an assignment of debt; and preparation of U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements for Quivira.
 
Our directors conducted their first visit to Ghana in August 2015, when they visited the Birim Region where the three Ghanaian concessions are located. The objective was to carry out a geological reconnaissance over the areas to identify potentially favourable lithologies. The directors inspected the existing field programs in Ghana and oversaw the planning and implementation of programs for the near future. Field work on the three concessions has since ceased and associated exploration permits have expired. Neither the Company nor Quivira holds any right title or claim to the concessions, but the Company endeavors to renew permits subject to securing sufficient financing. There is no guarantee that sufficient financing will be raise in a timely manner, if at all.
 
We intend to renew permits for three concessions in Ghana for their gold and diamond potential, and to explore the market for other viable assets. All three licences have expired and require an estimated $100,000 to renew. We are currently in discussions with with prospective equity investors to finance the renewal costs, however no agreement has been secured. Nevertheless, in order to secure necessary financing, we will be required to increase our authorized capital. The Asamankese, Osenase and Pramkese concessions are located near Asamankese, Akim Oda and Kade towns respectively. The concession is dominated by broad pene plain, dotted with moderate to high hills and remnant of rain forest. The area is hilly and rugged, running from 180m to 300m in elevation. Around the licences is the Atewa range about 1050m above sea level. There are little published records of extensive widely scattered gold mineralization old pits, shafts and adits, as well as artisanal gold workings in the concessions. In the mid-sixties, the Geological Survey Department of Ghana undertook reconnaissance mapping and soil geochemical survey in the area during which traces of gold were recorded in panned concentrates of geochemical samples.

1. | Osenase
---+--------

 Osenase is in the Birim Central Municipal District. The nearest town to the project area is the District Capital Akim Oda. This project has seen limited amount of gold exploration. The concession was previously held by Cornucopia Resources in the 1990s and was engaged in potential for a diamond resource. Paramount Mining Corporation held the concession for almost 6 years with limited amount of work. The limited work done was focused on diamondiferous hard rock potential at Atiankama Nkwanta. The presence of diamonds in what appears to be an in-situ unit exposed by the Francis Pits at Atiakama Nkwanta provides an opportunity to explain the source of some of the diamonds in the region. S Two oriented grids were sampled in 2007 but were never analysed for gold. The samples have been stored at the Manso camp to be analysed later. No subsequent work has been carried out to establish gold or diamond potential, and there is no guarantee that ore is present in economically significant quantity. 
 

2. | Asamankese
---+-----------

 Asamankese is a 150Km2 Prospecting License (PL) in the West Akim District. The nearest town to the project area is the District Capital Asamankese. Asamankese was originally part of Osenase under a reconnaissance licence. In 2006, about 4 soil-oriented grids on 800m x 50m was established and sampled. The samples were stored at the Manso camp to be analysed later. The samples are still in storage at the Manso camp. A total of 436 samples representing two of the gridlines L1600N and L2400N at 800m apart were later on analysed for gold. The samples were sent to SGS Tarkwa for 2kg BLEG analysis. Results received were not encouraging for gold, with only one modest spike of 170 ppb Au, associated with alluvials. A limited stream sediment program began in November 2008 but could not be completed due to financial constraints. About 108 stream sediment samples were collected and panned for visible gold out of a total 183 planned. No laboratory analysis was carried out. About 80 sample points are still yet to be sampled.
 

3. | Pramkese
---+---------

 Pramkese is a 66 square kilometres Prospecting License (PL) in the Kwaebibirim District located in the Birim Diamond Field. The nearest town to the project area is the District Capital Kade. Limited reconnaissance work was carried out in 2009 and the licence was converted to a Prospecting Licence. The exercise concentrated on the south of the town of Pramkese. Ten (10) alluvial pits were dug and sampled. The samples collected were panned and hand jigged for gold and diamond respectively. In the early 90’s, a fair amount of work was done on the concession for both alluvial gold and diamond by Basogard. Basogard defined some alluvial gold and diamond resources which were never investigated.
 
The company is now in discussions with various potential partners to explore and define the potential of these concessions, however no definitive agreements have been reached. There is no guarantee that any agreements will be reached or that permits will be secured.
 
Strategic Alliance with Ashanti Sankofa Inc.
 
In April 2018, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Ashanti Sankofa Inc., a TSX Venture Exchange listed company trading under the symbol “ASI” (“Ashanti”). Pursuant to the terms of the Strategic Alliance Agreement both parties have agreed to grant to the other party a right of first refusal to enter into a joint venture on any of their respective properties and/or projects and that any future acquisition of natural resource properties that may be acquired by either party that contains, but is not limited to, gold, precious metals, technology metals or diamonds (“Natural Resource Properties”), the acquiring party will grant to the other party a right of first refusal to participate in a joint venture on such Natural Resource Property, which shall be at the sole discretion of the acquiring party.
 
As part of our strategic alliance with Ashanti, we agreed to collaborate to explore and develop natural resource properties in West Africa, to undertake joint research projects and to consider joint commercial exploitation of any new property or project that may be acquired resulting from their joint research.
 
The strategic alliance with Ashanti will allow us to make our respective technical expertise in the field of exploration, exploitation and management of natural resources available to the other party.
 
In connection with the strategic alliance with Ashanti, we acquired by way of a private placement transaction, a total of 4,333,333 units in the capital stock of Ashanti for a total cost of CAD$130,000, with each unit consisting of one common share (the “Share”) and one transferable share purchase warrant (the “Warrant”) exercisable for a term of two-years at a price of CAD$0.05 per share.

Competitive Conditions
 
The mineral exploration and development business is an extremely competitive industry. We seek to compete with many other companies exploring for minerals and potentially developing minerals resources into mines. The status of our prospective Ghana projects is uncertain and our ability to secure financing and exploration permits is subject to competiton from local and international companies. As a junior mineral exploration and development company, Blox competes with many companies like ourselves for financing and joint venture partners. Additionally, we compete for industry human resources such as professional geologists, and service providers.
Government Approvals and Recommendations
 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations in West Africa, which govern prospecting, development, exploitation, production, export, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We intend to secure all necessary permits for the Mansounia Property.
 
Our activities are also subject to various federal and state/provincial laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We intend to conduct business with a view to safeguarding public health and the environment and operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, rescoping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Changes to current laws and regulations in West Africa could in the future require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
 
Guinea’s National Transition Council (CTN) amended its mining code in April 2013, in an effort to improve its investment record. The amendments brought profit taxes down to 30 percent, and cut the tax on bauxite to 0.15 percent of the international market price for aluminum. However, the new version still grants the government a free 15-percent stake in mining projects, as well as the option of purchasing an additional 20 percent stake. The clause is designed to encourage companies to process raw materials inside the sovereign’s borders, rather than just shipping the ore out. The state’s stake in the projects is said to shrink as the portion of value added inside the country’s borders increases.
 
Under the new mining code, an industrial exploitation or operating permit will be granted for 15 years. It can be renewed for five-year periods, provided the holder of the title complies with its obligations. Upon non-commencement of work within a year of the issuance of an exploitation permit for industrial operations, the previous monthly fine of GNF 5m has been revised to GNF10m, imposed for the first three months, with a monthly increase of 10 percent of the penalty amount thereafter.
 
Mining convention: The granting of a mining concession and an exploitation permit must be accompanied by the mining convention. The maximum duration of a mining convention is 25 years, renewable for one or several periods of 10 years. Mining conventions are subject to an executive order and will be signed by the Minister of Mines, following the advice of the National Mining Committee and the authorization of the Council of Ministers. Mining conventions will then be submitted for the legal opinion of the Supreme Court and ratified by Parliament.

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Although we currently have no costs to comply with environmental laws concerning our mineral property, we will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all work undertaken which causes sufficient surface disturbance to necessitate reclamation work.  Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible.  Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits.  Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to a natural state after completion of exploration activities.  Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused, i.e. refilling trenches after sampling or cleaning up fuel spills.  At this time, we do not require any reclamation or remediation other than minor clean up and removal of supplies because of minimal disturbance to the ground.  The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program we will undertake.  Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on our earnings or competitive position in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered.
Employees
 
We currently have no employees. Our officers and directors provide consulting services to us on a part time basis. We intend to retain the services of geologists, prospectors and consultants on a contract basis to conduct the exploration programs on our mineral claims and to assist with regulatory compliance and preparation of financial statements.
