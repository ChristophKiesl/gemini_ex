Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a microbiome therapeutics company developing a novel class of live biotherapeutic drugs, which are consortia of microbes designed to treat disease by modulating the microbiome to treat or prevent disease by repairing the function of a disease susceptible microbiome to a non-disease state. We have an advanced drug pipeline with late-stage clinical assets and a differentiated microbiome therapeutics drug discovery and development platform including good manufacturing practices, or GMP, manufacturing capabilities for this novel drug modality.  
 Our highest priority is preparing the SER-109 biologics license application, or BLA, for submission to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; we are focused on completing acquisition of the required safety database necessary for approval to treat Clostridioides difficile infection or CDI, with SER-109. Additionally, using our microbiome therapeutics platform, we are focusing our resources on obtaining clinical results from our clinical programs in ulcerative colitis, or UC, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, with SER-287 and SER-301, with SER-401 in patients with metastatic melanoma, and with SER-155 to prevent mortality due to gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia and GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or allo-HSCT, or solid organ transplants.
 SER-109, our lead clinical candidate, which has successfully completed a Phase 3 clinical study, is designed to rapidly modulate the gastrointestinal microbiome in patients with recurrent CDI. CDI is most often caused by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the gastrointestinal microbiome by decreasing microbial diversity, thus increasing susceptibility to infection by Clostridioides difficile, or C. difficile, a spore forming bacterium. C. difficile expresses toxins leading to debilitating diarrhea in infected patients, and can also cause more severe outcomes, such as inflammation of the colon (colitis), toxic megacolon and death. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, has identified CDI as one of the top three most urgent bacterial threats in the United States. It is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection in the United States and has overtaken methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, in incidence of disease. CDI is responsible for the deaths of over 20,000 Americans each year. There are approximately 453,000 cases of primary CDI within the United States each year and approximately 170,000 incidences of recurrent CDI. The standard of care for CDI is to treat with antibiotics. In many cases, antibiotic treatments may kill vegetative toxin-producing C. difficile bacteria thus resolving symptoms of C. difficile. However, these antibiotic treatments also kill beneficial bacteria indiscriminately, thus maintaining or exacerbating the disrupted microbiome, potentially making patients more susceptible to a recurrence of CDI. Furthermore, antibiotics do not eliminate C. difficile spores, allowing the spores to rapidly germinate in a disrupted microbiome and cause a recurrence of the infection. Published data suggests that the risk of recurrence is approximately 25% after the primary CDI and increases to greater than or equal to 40% after a first recurrence. SER-109, if approved, is intended to treat individuals with recurrent CDI, a patient population which includes approximately 170,000 individuals per year in the United States.  
 
SER-109 is an oral microbiome therapeutic candidate consisting of a consortium of highly purified Firmicute spores, which normally live in the healthy microbiome. SER-109 is designed to prevent further recurrences of CDI in patients with a history of multiple infections by modulating the disrupted microbiome to a state that resists C. difficile colonization and growth. We completed enrollment with 182 patients with multiply recurrent CDI in ECOSPOR III. The study was designed to evaluate patients for 24 weeks with the primary endpoint of comparing the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The SER-109 manufacturing purification process is designed to remove unwanted microbes thereby reducing the risk of pathogen transmission beyond donor screening alone. 
 In August 2020, we reported positive topline results from the interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 ECOSPOR III study evaluating SER-109 for multiply recurrent CDI.  Those results showed that SER-109 administration resulted in a highly statistically significant absolute decrease of 30.2% in the proportion of patients who experienced a recurrence in CDI within eight weeks of administration versus placebo, the study’s primary endpoint, and which remained consistent at 12-weeks end point with a 31.1% absolute decrease. At eight weeks of treatment, 11.1% of patients administered SER-109 experienced a CDI recurrence, versus 41.3% of placebo patients. The study results were equally compelling when characterized by the alternative metric of sustained clinical response, where 88.9% of patients in the SER-109 arm achieved this objective at eight weeks.  Subsequent analyses from the completed Phase 3 study using the final statistically defined Intent-to-Treat population show that 12.4% of subjects experienced a recurrence, versus 39.8% on placebo, which represents a relative risk of 0.32 (95% CI 0.18-0.58; p<.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 27% and a relative risk reduction of 69%. The percent on SER-109 with a sustained clinical response was approximately 88%. The number-needed-to treat was 3.7. In the same updated analysis, the 12 week rate of recurrence in the SER-109 arm was 18.0%, compared to a rate of 46.2% in the placebo arm, representing an absolute risk reduction of 28% (relative risk 0.40; 95% CI 0.24-0.65; p-value = 0.002), and thereby consistent with the results seen at eight weeks. Results across stratifications of age and antibiotics remained similar. The study’s efficacy results related to the primary endpoint from all analyses exceeded the statistical 
 5

threshold previously provided in consultation with the FDA that could allow this single clinical study to fulfill efficacy requirements for a BLA.  The efficacy remained durable through twenty-four weeks of follow-up.
 The SER-109 safety results observed to-date were favorable, with an adverse event profile comparable to placebo.  We are actively enrolling patients in our SER-109 open-label study, which also allows enrollment of patients with single or multiple recurrences of CDI, to expand the safety database to meet the FDA threshold of at least 300 patients.
 SER-287, an oral microbiome therapeutic candidate consisting of a consortium of highly purified Firmicute spores, is designed to normalize the gastrointestinal microbiome of individuals with UC. In December 2018, we commenced a three-arm placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial that was designed to evaluate SER-287 in approximately 201 patients with mild-to-moderate UC, termed ECO-RESET.  Two groups of patients are receiving different doses of SER-287, both following pre-conditioning with a short course of oral vancomycin. A third group are receiving placebo. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate clinical remission measured after 10 weeks of SER-287 administration. Patients then enter a 26-week exploratory maintenance follow-up period.  Endoscopic improvement will be measured as a secondary efficacy measure.  Based on feedback from the FDA, if the data from this trial is positive, we expect that the Phase 2b clinical trial could be one of two pivotal trials to enable a BLA to be submitted for SER-287 for the treatment of UC. We anticipate top-line results in mid-2021.  
 
The clinical development of SER-287 to treat UC, is supported by successful preclinical and clinical studies. Preclinical colitis animal models and in vitro screens provided evidence that SER-287 administration has the potential to reduce pathology and modulate inflammatory and immunological functional pathways.  Published clinical reports also suggest that modulation of the microbiome through repetitive fecal microbiota transplantation, or FMT, may lead to meaningful clinical response in UC patients.
 
We completed our Phase 1b clinical study for SER-287, in subjects with active mild to moderate UC who were failing their current therapies.  The results of the SER-287 Phase 1b study, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, induction study enrolled patients with active mild-to-moderate UC, with Total Modified Mayo scores of 4 to 10 were positive. The study enrolled 58 subjects who exhibited pre-study disease activity despite ongoing treatment with standard-of-care therapeutics. SER-287 safety and tolerability was a primary study endpoint. The study showed no imbalance in adverse events in SER-287-treated patients as compared to patients treated with placebo and no drug-related serious adverse events were observed. 
 
Analyses of microbiome data, a co-primary endpoint of the trial, showed that SER-287 induced regimen-dependent engraftment of SER-287 derived bacterial species into the colonic microbiome of patients treated with SER-287. Patients administered vancomycin pre-conditioning followed by daily administration of SER-287 had the highest level of SER-287 engraftment, which was statistically significant. This patient cohort corresponded with the study arm where the most significant clinical benefits were observed, including clinical remission and endoscopic improvement. Differences in the composition of the microbiome post treatment were also associated with clinical remission. Bacterial engraftment signatures were durable throughout the dosing period of the trial and were also observed at four weeks post administration of the final SER-287 dose.  The pharmacologic impact of the SER-287 engraftment was supported by metabolomic and transcriptomic data. Analysis of metabolites and gene expression signatures associated with inflammation and immune modulation, showed correlations with remission in SER-287 treated subjects. A paper titled “A Phase 1b Safety Study of SER-287, a Spore-Based Microbiome Therapeutic, For Active Mild-To-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis” was highlighted as the cover article in the January 2021 print edition of the leading journal Gastroenterology including data analysis on clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, modulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and a favorable safety profile.   We are also advancing our microbiome drug discovery and development capabilities and our next generation therapeutics, including SER-301, a therapeutic candidate for UC. SER-301 is a consortium of cultivated bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform that incorporates analysis of microbiome biomarkers from human clinical data and preclinical assessments using human cell-based assays and in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo disease models. SER-301 is designed to reduce induction of pro-inflammatory activity, improve epithelial barrier integrity and TNF-α driven inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells, or IECs, and modulate UC-relevant anti-inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune pathways.  SER-301 is being produced using our advanced fermentation, formulation and delivery platforms.  It includes strains delivered in spore form, as well as strains cultivated in non-spore (vegetative) form and delivered using enterically-protected technology designed to release in the colon. In November 2020 we enrolled our first patient in the SER-301 Phase 1b study.  This initial clinical study of SER-301 is being conducted in Australia and New Zealand.
 SER-155 is an oral microbiome therapeutic candidate, consisting of a consortium of cultivated bacteria, that we are advancing into clinical development. The rationale for this program is based in part on published clinical evidence from our collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center showing that allo-HSCT patients with decreased diversity of commensal microbes were significantly more likely to die due to infection and/or lethal graft versus host disease, or GvHD. SER-155 is a consortium of cultivated bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform to prevent mortality due to gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia and GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving allo-HSCT or solid organ transplants. SER-155 is designed to decrease infection and translocation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and modulate host 
 6

immune responses to decrease GvHD. In November 2017, we were awarded a highly competitive grant from CARB-X to support continued preclinical research and early development work for SER-155. In 2019, Seres was awarded additional funding from CARB-X to support clinical development of SER-155, including support through investigational new drug application, or IND submission and Phase 1b evaluation. The 2019 CARB-X grant provides us with an additional $4.8 million of funding for research, manufacture, and IND submission, with potential for an additional $7.0 million for Phase 1b development, upon completion of milestones.  We expect to initiate clinical development of SER-155 in the first half of 2021. 
 SER-401 is an oral microbiome therapeutic candidate, consisting of a consortium of purified bacteria and comprising a bacterial signature similar to that observed in checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy responders. In March 2019, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b clinical study with MD Anderson and the Parker Institute, to evaluate SER-401’s potential to augment the response of anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The study is designed to enroll 30 patients with metastatic melanoma who are being treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients are randomized at a 2-to-1 ratio to either SER-401 or placebo. The study’s primary endpoints are to evaluate safety and tolerability. Its secondary endpoints are to evaluate the correlation of microbiome biomarkers of response to various clinical and immunological outcome measures.
 Seres continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on company operations and ongoing clinical development activity, including on the SER-401 Phase 1b study in metastatic melanoma. We are working with MD Anderson and PICI to evaluate the potential impact to the SER-401 Phase 1b readout. 
 We have assembled a world class group of scientists, clinicians, directors and investors, who have established our leadership in the field of microbiome therapeutics. We were co-founded by Drs. Noubar Afeyan, David Berry and Geoffrey von Maltzahn of Flagship Pioneering. Through Flagship Pioneering’s contribution of foundational scientific concepts and intellectual property, assembly of our management team and critical early-stage support, we launched as the first company focused on the ecological nature of the microbiome. Led by Eric Shaff, our President and Chief Executive Officer, our experienced management team possesses core capabilities in microbiome therapeutics, drug development, commercialization, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, public company management and finance. Our management team has extensive experience in microbial ecology, microbiology and live biological products, with over 25 years of experience studying the microbiome and over 60 published papers on the science of the microbiome. Additionally, our team has extensive experience in building out commercial capabilities in specialty diseases and has a track record for success in the commercialization of vaccine products, which have analogous manufacturing processes to that of microbiome therapeutics.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to remain the leading biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing microbiome therapeutics to address significant unmet medical needs. We intend to focus in the near term on gaining FDA approval for SER-109 for recurrent CDI and continuing development of our highest priority clinical programs. Additionally, we continue to advance our differentiated microbiome drug discovery, development and manufacturing platforms and capabilities.  
Advancing our Programs
  
• | Advancing the development of our lead product candidate, SER-109, for patients with recurrent CDI toward a BLA filing and product commercialization. In August 2020 we reported positive topline results from the interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 ECOSPOR III study evaluating SER-109 for recurrent CDI. Those results showed that SER-109 administration resulted in a highly statistically significant absolute decrease of 30.2% in the proportion of patients who experienced a recurrence in CDI within eight weeks of administration versus placebo, the study’s primary endpoint.

• | Continuing clinical development of SER-287 for the treatment of UC. The clinical development of SER-287 to treat UC is supported by both clinical and preclinical studies in multiple animal models of colitis that provided evidence that SER-287 administration may result in reduced inflammation. Published clinical reports suggest that modulation of the microbiome through repetitive FMT may lead to meaningful clinical response in certain UC patients. In December 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating SER‐287 in patients with mild‐to‐moderate UC who were failing current therapies. In October 2017, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 1b clinical trial of SER-287 in patients with UC. The SER-287 Phase 1b study, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, induction study enrolled patients with active mild-to-moderate UC, with Total Modified Mayo scores of 4 to 10. The study enrolled 58 patients at 20 sites across the United States. Study subjects exhibited pre-study disease activity despite use of current therapies in a majority of subjects, which included 5-amino-salacylic acid, low dose corticosteroids, or immunomodulatory therapy. Based on the encouraging data from the Phase 1b trial, in December 2018, we initiated our Phase 2b trial, ECO-RESET, evaluating SER-287 in patients with active mild-to-moderate UC. Based on feedback obtained from the FDA on the SER-287 Phase 2b study design, we believe the study, if successful, could serve as one of two required pivotal trials supporting potential future registration of SER-287. The Phase 2b study is a three-arm placebo-controlled trial of approximately 200 patients with active mild-to-moderate UC. Two groups of patients will receive different doses of SER-287, both following pre-conditioning with a short course of oral vancomycin. A third study arm will receive placebo. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate clinical remission measured after 10 weeks of SER-287 administration. Endoscopic improvement will be measured as a secondary efficacy measure. SER-287 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for pediatric UC.

• | Developing SER-301 for the treatment of IBD. We are developing SER-301, a microbiome therapeutic candidate comprised of a consortium of cultivated bacteria, for the treatment of IBD leveraging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from our SER-287 clinical trial, our knowledge of modulation of the microbiome seen in patients with UC, as well as insights from our SER-262 clinical study. In November 2020 we enrolled our first patient in the SER-301 Phase 1b study. This initial clinical study of SER-301 is being conducted in Australia and New Zealand.

We have nominated the SER-155 lead candidate, a microbiome therapeutic comprised of a consortium of cultivated bacteria and are advancing the candidate into clinical development. We expect to initiate clinical development of SER-155 in the first half of 2021.

• | Developing SER-401 for use with CPIs in patients with solid tumors. We are developing SER-401 for administration in combination with CPI treatment to increase efficacy in patients with solid tumors. The design is being driven by insights from our collaborators at MD Anderson and recent published data in a number of high-profile scientific journals from other international research groups that suggest that the microbiome may impact patients’ response to CPI treatment. Together with our collaborators, we have initiated a Phase 1b multicenter study in metastatic melanoma patients as part of our collaboration with MD Anderson and the Parker Institute.

Advancing Our Capabilities
  
• | Leveraging our leading reverse translation microbiome therapeutics platform to develop additional innovative and novel microbiome therapeutics across a range of serious medical conditions with high unmet need including infectious and inflammatory disease and disease associated with modulation of host immunity. We believe that the combination of experience, proprietary data and proprietary know-how related to the microbiome and of the production of microbial strains provides us a competitive advantage in the design and development of microbiome therapeutics. Our platform enables us to build upon our existing and growing clinical experience to rationally design treatments for acute and complex chronic diseases. We intend to leverage this advantage to develop additional innovative microbiome therapeutics.

• | Developing manufacturing capabilities sufficient to support commercialization of any approved microbiome therapeutic candidates. Microbiome therapeutic manufacturing requires capabilities that are distinct from other biologic drugs. We have made strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities to help ensure that we maintain control of our know-how and also because we believe these capabilities will be necessary and highly advantageous for the development of future microbiome therapeutic candidates. Our bioprocess and manufacturing personnel are focused on creating a platform of manufacturing expertise that will set the stage for further advances in the emerging field of microbiome therapeutics.

Our Microbiome Therapeutics Platform
 We have developed the leading microbiome therapeutics platform which we believe enables us to apply our capabilities to efficiently identify, manufacture and develop novel microbiome therapeutics for serious human diseases. We use a reverse translational discovery platform that incorporates analysis of microbiome biomarkers from human clinical data and preclinical 
 8

assessments using human cell-based assays and in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo disease models. Specifically, we start with data sets from both healthy subjects and subjects with disease to delineate at high-resolution the composition of the microbiome and physiological state of subjects and to identify specific microbiome and host signatures that associate with disease or the onset of disease. These in-human insights are leveraged in preclinical drug design and development. 
 Our discovery process begins with human data derived from clinical trials and cohort studies, which we use as a basis for target identification and the design of our microbiome therapeutic candidates. We compare healthy, normal colonic microbiomes to those in an unhealthy disrupted or disease state, revealing the ecological, compositional and functional differences between various states of disease and during the transition from health to disease or vice versa. Specifically, we identify at high-resolution, specific groups, species and strains of microbes as well as microbe-associated metabolites that are associated with disease states. These microbiome biomarkers are associated with host signatures and biomarkers of disease to identify disease targets for our microbiome therapeutics. Our clinical data from the SER-109, SER-262 and SER-287 programs, and microbiome data generated with external collaborators, serve to instruct us on how the introduction of certain keystone microbes have the potential to restructure the microbiome and modulate the metabolic state of the gut to shift it to a non-disease state. 
 We have developed a proprietary suite of assays and bioinformatics and computational tools, which facilitate our insights into the human microbiome. We have established proprietary, curated, reference databases and algorithms that: (i) integrate high-resolution genomic, metagenomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic data sets, and data from in vitro and human cell-based assays, and in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo disease models, and (ii) enable us to track changes in the microbiome at the level of microbial species and individual strains and associate these changes with changes in the metabolic state of the gut and host physiology. Our analytics can integrate gene profiling and metabolomics data (the small molecules made by the microbiome) with genomic data (the collection of microbes defined by sequencing) to delineate microbiome biomarkers (the specific species or strains and functional pathways) that contribute to the state of disease or health.  Further, we have established de novo analytics for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments of microbiome therapeutics.
 Our proprietary strain library of bacterial isolates from healthy donors and patients enables us to translate microbiome biomarker insights into defined consortia of bacteria.  The strain library contains bacterial species isolated from individuals that are either healthy or that have a disease. Seres has developed extensive isolation and cultivation know-how. The strain library contains a majority of the Human Microbiome Project’s “most wanted” and many novel species not described in other databases or the scientific literature.  The functional properties of strains are characterized using proprietary in vitro and ex vivo human cell-based assays as well as full-genome sequences and genome functional annotation.  Functional characterization of target strains includes properties such as how the bacteria interact with human colonic epithelial cells and human immune cells.  We also seek to understand how these microbes improve the health of barrier cells in the gut and how this may impact immune responses.
 We select bacteria from our library with specific predicted properties using novel algorithms for in silico functional design and grow the compositions in the lab to be tested both in vitro/ex vivo models as delineated above and in in vivo animal models.  Our animal models include conventional mice, germ-free mice, and “humanized” mice that possess only bacteria derived from humans; these models were developed to minimize confounding variables presented by murine microbes.  Data from our in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo screens are analyzed and used to optimize compositional designs; introducing new bacterial strains and optimizing existing strains until we identify a lead composition suitable for clinical testing.
 Finally, we manufacture the bacterial composition under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, which are required by FDA and European regulators. We believe our unique manufacturing capacities position us to exploit the insights of our proprietary human data and the novel biology of species and strains that have not previously been used for therapeutics. We have optimized fermentation conditions to generate spores and enhance bacterial yields in anaerobic fermentation and have in-house capabilities to formulate both spores and live non-spore bacteria. Our manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts was designed to be fit-for-purpose and is highly differentiated compared to the offerings of commercial contract research organizations. We continue working to address quality control requirements for our microbiome therapeutic candidates using proprietary microbiological and sequence-based testing schemes, including high-throughput quantitative analytics to assess the identity, potency, and purity of the final product. We intend to work with regulators to meet the requirements for product approval. 
 Taken together, we believe our platform, spanning drug discovery, preclinical translation, and novel manufacturing and quality control approaches, has enabled a field leading pipeline across a range of therapeutics areas.
 Disease Overview and Our Product Pipeline
 We believe our microbiome therapeutic candidates represent a novel approach with potential application across a broad range of human diseases. Our most advanced drug development program, SER-109, focuses on recurrent CDI. SER-109 has successfully completed a Phase 3 study and the product candidate has been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy and an Orphan Drug by the FDA for the treatment of CDI. We are actively enrolling patients in our SER-109 open-label study, which also is enrolling patients with 
 9

either a single or multiple recurrence of CDI, to expand the safety database to meet the FDA specified threshold of at least 300 patients. SER-287 is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC and has completed a Phase 1b study in the United States. SER-287 has been designated an Orphan Drug for pediatric UC by the FDA. We have designed SER-301, a microbiome therapeutic candidate comprised of a consortium of cultivated bacteria, for the treatment of UC. We are advancing SER-155 into clinical developments, and we are designing SER-401 for combination therapy with immune CPIs in cancer. We have also conducted early stage research on potential microbiome therapeutic candidates for the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as early-stage, non-insulin dependent diabetes, NASH, and metabolic syndrome. Research in these indications is focused on developing drugs that address specific functional defects in the microbiome, including the specific metabolic products made by the microbes. We believe this approach may enable pursuit of a range of disorders including various forms of liver disease and rare genetic diseases of metabolism. 
 CDI Overview and SER-109
 Clostridioides difficile Infection
 C. difficile is a Gram-positive, toxin-producing, spore forming bacterium that may cause debilitating diarrhea in infected individuals, but can also lead to more severe outcomes, such as inflammation of the colon, or colitis, toxic megacolon and death. C. difficile bacteria express toxins that disrupt the structural architecture of cells causing leakage of fluids through the GI epithelium. The cells disrupted by these toxins eventually undergo apoptosis and die, disrupting the epithelial barrier and exposing the immune system to inflammatory stimuli, severe and persistent diarrhea and, in the most serious cases, death.
 CDI is most often associated with the prior use of antibiotics, although age and poor immune status are important risk factors as well. Antibiotics are thought to decrease colonization resistance to CDI by disrupting the microbiome. Since C. difficile spores are able to survive for long periods of time outside the body, and because healthcare settings are often sites of significant antibiotic use, CDI is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections in the US, with long-term care facilities specifically having some of the highest CDI rates. CDI is also a cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized cancer patients and bone marrow transplant patients as their immune systems are suppressed by cytotoxic drugs, which inhibit or prevent the functioning of cells, and they may be heavily treated with antibiotics to prevent or treat infections. More recently, the rise of community-acquired CDI has been recognized as a growing problem.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has identified C. difficile as one of the top three most urgent antibiotic-resistant bacterial threats in the United States. It is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection in the United States, having overtaken MRSA. CDI is responsible for the deaths of over 20,000 Americans each year. There are approximately 453,000 cases of primary CDI within the United States each year and approximately 170,000 incidences of recurrent CDI. CDI is also costly to the healthcare system. According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, the economic burden of CDI in 2008 in U.S. acute care facilities alone was estimated to be as much as $4.8 billion. In addition, the average recurrent CDI treatment cost in the U.S. is estimated to be $34 thousand per patient, comprising mostly (88%) hospital-related costs (Rodrigues Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017). The national incidence of CDI remains high despite declining from 476,000 in 2011 to 462,000 in 2017 (Guh, New England Journal of Medicine 2020). Further, according to a 2014 article in the American Journal of Infection Control, from 2001 to 2010, incidence of CDI per 1,000 patients discharged increased from 4.5 to 8.2 with an average hospital stay of eight days. Due to suboptimal approaches to treatment, patients with primary CDI have an approximate 20% - 25% change of recurrent infection increasing to greater than 40% after the first recurrence (Gerding, CID 2018; Lashner ACG 2020; Dubberke CID 2018). Based on an epidemiological study conducted by the CDC, the incidence of CDI in the United States, based on a positive toxin or molecular assay in patients who did not have a positive result in the previous 8 weeks, was estimated to be 453,000 (95% confidence interval, 397,100 to 508,500) (Lessa et. al., Burden of Clostridium difficile Infection in the United States, New England J. of Medicine, 2015).
 Current and developing treatment alternatives and their limitations
 Antibiotics.  According to the Infectious Disease Society of America, or IDSA, guidelines, the current standard of care for primary CDI is to treat with antibiotics, such as fidaxomicin or vancomycin. Fidaxomicin is recommended to treat primary CDI, it does not have a label claim to reduce or prevent CDI recurrence. No antibiotic therapeutics are currently approved for treatment of recurrent CDI.
Recurrent CDI, defined as the presence of diarrhea and a positive C. difficile stool assay within two to eight weeks following the initial episode, is not well addressed by any of the available antibiotics. The risk of recurrent CDI increases to greater than 40% after the first recurrence. In extreme cases, patients are treated continuously for years with vancomycin, even while they continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and abdominal discomfort.
 Antibiotics have two major limitations: they have no effect on the spores that germinate in a disrupted microbiome and their use appears to exacerbate microbiome disruption, resulting in increased risk of future CDI. Research in animal models has shown that antibiotic use not only eliminates many healthy bacteria in the GI tract, but also leads to the release of nutrients that facilitate the growth of C. difficile. Antibiotics have also been shown to change the ratio of primary versus secondary bile acids in the colon by killing bacteria required to metabolize bile acids. This shift to a predominance of primary bile acids further facilitates the growth of C. 
 10

difficile, as it requires primary bile acids for germination of its spores. As a result, antibiotic use may induce a lasting microbiome disruption that makes it possible for C. difficile to colonize a person and then cause, or further perpetuate, disease.
 Fecal microbiota transplantation.  FMT, also known as a stool transplantation, is an unapproved procedure during which donated stool, including fecal microbes, is typically instilled via colonoscopy into a patient with CDI. FMT presents several challenges for effective treatment of the disease. FMT has the potential to transmit infectious or allergenic agents between hosts, involves the transmission of hundreds of unknown strains of bacteria, fungi, viruses and potentially parasites from donor to subject, and is difficult to perform on a mass scale. In November 2019 the FDA held a public hearing to obtain input on the use of FMT to treat Clostridioides difficile infection not responsive to standard therapies. Presentations were made by the academic community and development companies regarding the current and future use of FMT. In January, 2020, we submitted comments to the docket for the meeting that recommended: 1) increased scrutiny and regulation of unapproved, commercially available FMT that does not comply with IND requirements; 2) implementation of guidance for establishing safety of source materials for all microbiome products; and 3) safety and efficacy of all microbiome products to reduce recurrent CDI must be based on adequate and well controlled clinical trials including accurate assurance of diagnosis of the disease state – specifically toxin testing.  
 Additionally, FMT is inherently non-standardized so that different desired and/or undesired material may be transmitted in any given donation. FMT is not approved by the FDA and we believe that, as currently practiced by clinical centers in the United States, it may be unable to gain such approval since the product, to our knowledge, cannot be characterized according to current regulatory requirements for identity, potency, purity and safety and has not been tested in rigorous, placebo controlled, randomized and blinded clinical studies. Commercial providers of FMT must meet FDA regulatory requirements for a biologics license and must produce FMT material using cGMP.
 Antibodies. Bezlotoxumab a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against C. difficile toxin B was approved in the United States in October 2016 and in Europe in 2017 for the treatment of CDI. The antibody demonstrated 10% absolute risk reduction in preventing recurrence of CDI. Antibodies bind toxins to alleviate the symptoms of CDI, but they do not address the underlying disruption of the microbiome, which we believe is the cause of recurrent CDI. Bezlotoxumab requires intravenous infusion. 
 SER-109
 SER-109 is an oral microbiome therapeutic candidate consisting of a consortium of highly purified Firmicute spores from healthy screened donors. SER-109 is designed to prevent further recurrences of CDI in patients with a history of multiple infections by restructuring the disrupted microbiome to a state that resists C. difficile colonization and growth.  SER-109, if approved, is intended to treat individuals with recurrent CDI, a patient population which includes approximately 170,000 individuals per year in the United States.  We completed enrollment with 182 patients with multiply recurrent CDI in ECOSPOR III. All patients who entered ECOSPOR III were required to have tested positive for C. difficile toxin. This inclusion criterion was implemented in an effort to ensure enrollment of only patients with active infection rather than simple colonization. The study was designed to evaluate patients for 24 weeks with the primary endpoint of comparing the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The SER-109 manufacturing purification process is designed to remove unwanted microbes thereby reducing the risk of pathogen transmission beyond donor screening alone.
In August 2020, we reported positive topline results from the interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 ECOSPOR III study evaluating SER-109 for recurrent CDI.  Those results showed that SER-109 administration resulted in a highly statistically significant absolute decrease of 30.2% in the proportion of patients who experienced a recurrence in CDI within eight weeks of administration versus placebo, the study’s primary endpoint, and which remained consistent at 12-weeks end point with a 31.1% absolute decrease. At eight weeks of treatment, 11.1% of patients administered SER-109 experienced a CDI recurrence, versus 41.3% of placebo patients. The study results were equally compelling when characterized by the alternative metric of sustained clinical response, where 88.9% of patients in the SER-109 arm achieved this objective at eight weeks.  Subsequent  analyses from the completed Phase 3 study using the final statistically defined Intent-to-Treat population show that 12.4% of subjects experienced a recurrence, versus 39.8% on placebo, which represents a relative risk of 0.32 (95% CI .018-0.58; p<.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 27% and an relative risk reduction of 69%. The percent on SER-109 with a sustained clinical response was approximately 88%. The number-needed-to treat was 3.7. In the same updated analysis the 12 week rate of recurrence in the SER-109 arm was 18.0%, compared to a rate of 46.2% in the placebo arm, representing an absolute risk reduction of 28% (relative risk 0.40; 95% CI 0.24-0.65; p-value = 0.002), and thereby consistent with the results seen at eight weeks. Results across stratifications of age and antibiotics remained similar. The study’s efficacy results from all analyses exceeded the statistical threshold previously provided in consultation with the FDA that could allow this single clinical study to fulfill efficacy requirements for a biological license application, or BLA. The efficacy remained durable through twenty-four weeks of follow-up.  
 11

The SER-109 safety results observed to-date were favorable, with an adverse event profile comparable to placebo.  We are actively enrolling patients in our SER-109 open-label study, which is enrolling patients with single or multiple recurrences of CDI, to expand the safety database to meet the FDA threshold of at least 300 patients.
 Phase 1b/2 clinical study design
 The Phase 1b/2 clinical study was a two-part trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-109 in 30 patients with recurrent CDI. Part 1 of the study evaluated a single dose of SER-109 administered orally in 30 capsules over two days, with a dose that varied between 3 x 107 and 2 x 1010 spores. Part 2 of the study evaluated a single dose of SER-109 administered orally in a range of one to 7 capsules over one day. The target dose in Part 2 was 1x108 spores per dose, which was approximately 17-fold lower than the mean dose in Part 1.
 
Phase 1b/2 clinical study results
 The primary efficacy measure was the absence of CDI (defined in this study as more than three unformed bowel movements in a 24-hour period with laboratory confirmation of a positive C. difficile stool test) during the eight weeks after initiating therapy. Twenty-six of 30 patients, or 87% of patients, in the Phase 1b/2 clinical study achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, consisting of 13 patients in each of Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. Among the 26 patients was one patient who experienced an initial recurrence on Day 26 and was re-treated, per protocol, with a dose from the same donor. Following re-treatment, this patient also achieved the primary efficacy endpoint. Of the patients who did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint, one had a recurrence of CDI on Day 5 and did not receive a second treatment with SER-109 and the three other patients were determined by their attending investigator to be recovering from their diarrheal episode by the time they submitted their stool sample for CDI testing. The three patients were determined to be clinically CDI free at eight weeks. As a result, the clinical cure rate for the study, which we defined as the absence of CDI requiring antibiotic treatment during the eight-week period after SER-109 dosing, was 97%, or 29 of 30 patients. SER-109 was observed to be well tolerated in this study. The most common AEs were diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity and consistent with post-antibiotic recovery from CDI. 
 Phase 2 clinical study design
 The Phase 2 clinical study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group two arm trial that enrolled a total of 89 patients with a history of multiply-recurrent CDI, defined as 3 or more CDI episodes within 9 months. Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio with 59 subjects receiving SER-109 and 30 subjects receiving placebo. SER-109 was administered orally as a single dose of 108 bacterial spores, following the completion of antibiotic treatment for CDI. The study was conducted at 36 centers across the United States. The primary endpoint was the absence of recurrence of C. difficile positive diarrhea requiring antibiotic treatment up to 8 weeks following treatment with SER-109 or placebo. 
 Phase 2 clinical study results
 The predefined study primary efficacy endpoint was the relative risk of CDI recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment with SER-109 compared to treatment with placebo.  CDI recurrence was defined as diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days, a positive CDI test, and the requirement for antibiotic treatment. Based on 8-week data, CDI recurrence occurred in 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109, compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo. The relative risk of CDI recurrence for the placebo population compared to the SER-109 population was not statistically significant. 
 The most commonly reported AEs in both the SER-109 and placebo arms were in the GI category, and were diarrhea (25% vs 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs 14%), flatulence (12% vs 3%), and nausea (10% vs 10%), for SER-109 and placebo, respectively. No drug-related SAEs were observed. The SER-109 analyses were shared with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, a new Phase 3 SER-109 clinical study in patients with multiply recurrent CDI was initiated. Study participants were randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo and received a total dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than in the Phase 2 study, administered over three consecutive days. Diagnosis of CDI for both study entry and for endpoint analysis was confirmed by C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the first Phase 2, where most patients were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. 
 Analysis of Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical study results
  In our Phase 2 clinical study, the study’s primary endpoint of reducing the relative risk of CDI recurrence at up to 8 weeks after treatment was not achieved. In order to understand the difference in outcome between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and CMC data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109 efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures 
 12

and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and reviewed analytical methods, that may have differed between the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. We identified key factors that potentially explain the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of subjects in the trial. 
 The key factors include:
  
• | The diagnostic test for entry may not have differentiated subjects with active CDI disease from those with other disease but who had C. difficile carriage (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The diagnostic test for CDI recurrence during the study (the primary endpoint) overestimated recurrences, as PCR was the most common test performed;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The safety profile of SER-109, which may include diarrhea in the first week following dosing, led to SER-109 subjects presenting for evaluation of recurrence at a time when they were likely to be colonized with C. difficile leading to mistaken diagnosis of recurrent CDI; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The dose and dosing regimen used in the study may not have been optimal in the Phase 2 clinical study based upon an assessment of the microbiome response using whole metagenomics shotgun sequencing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
From our reanalysis of the phase 1b/2 and 2 trials, we learned that there is a dose-dependent response governing early SER-109 pharmacokinetics, with increased engraftment associated with successful CDI resolution through 8 weeks. In the Phase 2 trial, SER-109 was dosed at 1 × 108 spores based on equivalent clinical outcomes and week 8 engraftment measures observed between the phase 1 dosing cohorts. However, our integrated analysis of both trials revealed that (1) engraftment kinetics at week 1 were of greater importance for reducing rCDI than later time points, (2) week 1 engraftment was highly variable in Phase 2 subjects, and (3) rapid engraftment was dependent on dose, which was clearly suboptimal in the Phase 2 trial (McGovern, 2020; Young, 2020). We hypothesized that rapid engraftment of a microbiome therapeutic may be critical to efficacy since CDI recurrence usually occurs within 1–3 weeks of antibiotic discontinuation, the “window of vulnerability”; consistent with this hypothesis, in the Phase 2 trial, greater engraftment of SER-109 species at week 1 was correlated with reduced CDI rates. This correlation was not previously appreciated due to the use of lower resolution 16S rRNA gene amplicon–based methods used in the Phase 1b/2 study for determining drug engraftment (Khanna, 2016).
 Phase 3 clinical study design
In June 2017 we initiated a Phase 3 clinical study of SER-109 in patients with multiply recurrent CDI. Study participants were randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo. Diagnosis of CDI for both study entry and for endpoint analysis utilizes a C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the Phase 2 clinical study, where most patients were diagnosed by PCR. Patients in the SER-109 arm received a total SER-109 dose, administered over three days, approximately 10-fold higher than the dose used in the Phase 2 clinical study to drive rapid engraftment of SER-109 bacteria in treated patients. The study evaluated patients for 24 weeks and the primary endpoint was to compare the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing.  CDI recurrence is defined as diarrhea (>3 unformed bowel movements/day for 2 or more consecutive days), a positive CDI toxin test, and the decision by the primary investigator that antibiotic treatment is warranted. The study was conducted at approximately 100 sites in the United States and Canada.  
 Phase 3 clinical study results
 The study enrolled 182 patients with multiply recurrent CDI.  The analysis reported in August 2020 on the dataset locked for the interim analysis showed that SER-109 administration resulted in a highly statistically significant absolute decrease of 30.2% in the proportion of patients who experienced a recurrence in CDI within eight weeks of administration versus placebo, the study’s primary endpoint, and which remained consistent at 12-weeks end point with a 31.1% absolute decrease. At eight weeks of treatment, 11.1% of patients administered SER-109 experienced a CDI recurrence, versus 41.3% of placebo patients. The study results were equally compelling when characterized by the alternative metric of sustained clinical response, where 88.9% of patients in the SER-109 arm achieved this objective at eight weeks. Subsequent analyses from the completed Phase 3 study using the final statistically defined Intent-to-Treat population show that 12.4% of subjects experienced a recurrence, versus 39.8% on placebo, which represents a relative risk of 0.32 (95% CI 0.18-0.58; p<.001), with an absolute risk reduction of 27% and a relative risk reduction of 69%. The percent on SER-109 with a sustained clinical response was approximately 88%. The number-needed-to treat was 3.7. In the same updated analysis, the 12 week rate of recurrence in the SER-109 arm was 18.0%, compared to a rate of 46.2% in the placebo arm, representing an absolute risk reduction of 28% (relative risk 0.40; 95% CI 0.24-0.65; p-value = 0.002), and thereby consistent with the results seen at eight weeks. Results across stratifications of age and antibiotics remained similar. The study’s efficacy results related to the primary endpoint from all analyses exceeded the statistical threshold previously provided in consultation with the FDA that could allow this single clinical study to fulfill efficacy requirements for a biological license application, or BLA.  The efficacy remained durable through twenty-four weeks of follow-up. 
 13

The SER-109 safety results observed to-date were favorable. SER-109 was well-tolerated through week 8, with a safety profile comparable to placebo.  There was no clinically meaningful imbalance in incidence of adverse events between SER-109 and placebo arms.  Overall incidence of patients who experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, was 92.2% for SER-109 and 91.3% for placebo.  SER-109 had no related serious treatment-related adverse events and no treatment related infections.  The most commonly observed TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders, the majority of which were mild to moderate in nature.
 The study data examined the pharmacokinetics (i.e., drug bacterial species engraftment) and pharmacodynamics (i.e., metabolic changes) following SER-109 dosing. The data demonstrate that SER-109 administration resulted in the rapid and durable engraftment of SER-109-derived bacterial species into the gastrointestinal tract as soon as one week following dosing, and that this engraftment was maintained at subsequent timepoints evaluated, including at the eight-week timepoint corresponding to the study’s primary endpoint and the 24-week safety follow-up timepoint. The presence of SER-109 bacterial species was significantly greater (p<0.001) in SER-109 treated patients than in placebo patients at all timepoints evaluated. Significant differences were maintained in predefined subpopulation analyses of age and antibiotic use. Seres utilized advanced microbiome biomarker analytics and proprietary genomic reference datasets to identify, at a resolution of bacterial species, the gastrointestinal microbiome signatures associated with SER-109 engraftment.
 SER-109 administration also resulted in modulation of the gastrointestinal metabolic landscape. Notably, data demonstrated a significant decrease in primary bile acids (p=0.038) and an increase in secondary bile acids (p<0.001) by one-week post-dosing; significant differences were maintained through week eight for secondary bile acids. Notably, SER-109 subjects had less variance across subjects in bile acid response than placebo subjects. Observations for both primary and secondary bile acids were maintained in predefined subpopulation analyses of age and antibiotic use. All microbiome analyses were conducted according to the treatment subjects actually received. Published research as well as preclinical studies have demonstrated that primary bile acids support germination of C. difficile spores that are the source of disease recurrence. In contrast, secondary bile acids have been reported to inhibit germination and the growth of C. difficile (Theriot and Young, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2015).
 Manufacturing.  
 SER-109 is a purified consortium of Firmicute spores produced through a process of extraction from a natural human stool source, obtained from qualified, highly screened donors. The donor raw material is collected in a controlled setting, under a protocol that is designed to ensure that donors meet appropriate qualification criteria.
 Donors are required to be in good health, and to possess a medical history that minimizes the risk of exposure to and transmission of an infectious disease. Donors are tested for infectious agents and screened for GI and other health factors. Donors are monitored for health status changes during the donation period. At the end of the donation period, the qualification assessment is repeated to help ensure the donor has maintained their health status. After successful completion of an exit screening, donations are released for use in manufacturing.
 We initially process the donor material in a Cambridge manufacturing facility, and then transfer the process intermediate to a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to isolate and concentrate SER-109 for finishing to the oral capsule dosage form. The purified drug substance is tested for identity, potency and purity, and subsequently formulated into drug product where it is again tested for identity, potency, purity, and pharmaceutical properties. The final drug product dosage form is four hard capsules daily for 3-days. Steps are specifically built into the process to remove and kill non-spore microbes. We have conducted validation studies demonstrating the ability of the process to inactivate and clear hypothetical extraneous pathogens of concern, and we believe we have sufficient data from these studies to support ongoing and proposed clinical trials.
 We believe we can address market demand with a relatively small-scale manufacturing process. If approved, we anticipate that we will be able to produce a sufficient commercial supply of SER-109 to meet estimated demand in the United States using donations from a modest number of donors.
 Ulcerative Colitis, SER-287 and SER-301
 UC is a relapsing-remitting chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the mucosal surface of the colon, leading to episodes of bloody diarrhea, urgency and mucosal inflammation (Danese and Fiocchi, 2011), which generally begins in young adulthood and endures for life. As the disease mostly affects young and middle-aged individuals, a time of peak reproductive and economic productivity, the disease leads to decreased quality of life in those affected by the condition, high morbidity, and significant health economic burden. (Ghosh and Mitchell, 2007; Kappelman et al., 2008; Rubin et al., 2014; Theede et al., 2015) The incidence of UC is rising worldwide, and the prevalence of the disease is highest in the United States, Canada, and Europe. In the United States alone, the prevalence of UC in adults is estimated to be 263 per 100,000, while in the pediatric population (age <20 years), prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 33.9 per 100,000. (Kappelman et al., 2013) 
 14

UC is characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the colon. The severity of symptoms, diarrhea associated with blood and abdominal pain, may range from mild disease to severe disease with more than 10 stools per day with severe cramps and continuous bleeding. The severity, extent, and duration of disease are also risk factors for developing colon cancer, which occurs at a rate as high as 0.5-1.0% per year, an important complication given the young age at which the disease strikes. Patients with UC also experience increased risk of CDI and primary sclerosing cholangitis, compared to the general population.
 The pathogenesis of UC is unclear but thought to arise from an aberrant immune response to a change in the colonic environment in a genetically susceptible individual. The key features of UC include diffuse mucosal inflammation in a continuous pattern starting distally in the rectum to more proximal disease in the left colon to pancolitis. 
 Symptoms of UC include rectal bleeding, tenesmus, increased stool frequency, urgency, incontinence, fever, fatigue and malaise, which negatively impact quality of life, physical and mental health and productivity. A subset of patients has extra-intestinal manifestations ranging from iron deficiency anemia to primary sclerosing cholangitis with implications for increased morbidity. In pediatric patients, the symptoms of UC have a more damaging impact, as they affect children’s growth and lead to delayed puberty. These patients also suffer from weight loss, anemia and joint symptoms and current therapy itself adversely impacts normal growth and development. (Kelsen et al., 2008). Treatment of UC with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents adds further medical complications to these vulnerable patients, including corticosteroid toxicity and increased risk of invasive infections and malignancy. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of the disease. Environmental factors may induce an ongoing immune response and inflammation in the genetically predisposed host. Efforts to identify specific environmental factors has implicated commensal bacteria or their products as key determinants of the inflammatory response in UC patients (Xavier et al., 2007). Thus, we believe SER-287 may target an “underlying cause” of UC rather than its symptoms.
 Current and developing treatment alternatives and their limitations
 Currently, patients with UC require life-long therapy. The goals of medical therapy are to induce and maintain clinical and endoscopic remission. Endoscopic remission is recognized as a key treatment goal since it better predicts short- and long-term clinical outcomes than symptomatic improvement alone. Attainment of these goals is generally associated with improved quality of life and decreased need for corticosteroids, and lower risk of hospitalization, colectomy, and colon cancer. 
 Although the etiology of UC is not fully understood, much progress has been made in the understanding of pathogenesis. Under homeostatic conditions, there is a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine signals mediated by epithelial and immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract. However, UC is characterized by dysregulated mucosal immune responses and translocation of inflammatory mediators of microbiological origin across a disrupted gastrointestinal barrier that may cause or perpetuate inflammation leading to chronic inflammatory disease. Migration of innate and adaptive immune cells into gut mucosal tissues is potentiated by locally produced cytokines and chemokines, and by the expression of integrins that enhance cellular trafficking into the gut lamina propria. Inhibition of the immune response, via antibodies and proteins that sequester pro-inflammatory cytokines or block the function of integrins, has been an important target of UC drug development over the past decade. 
 Management of UC includes medications that decrease general inflammation (e.g., 5-aminosalicylate derivatives, or 5-ASA, corticosteroids) or dampen specific components of the host immune response (e.g., immunomodulators, inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor, anti-integrin antibodies). 
 For mild-to-moderate disease, the 5-ASA derivatives are the standard of care for both induction and remission. 5-ASA derivatives achieve clinical remission in only 25-40% of patients during induction and approximately one-third of responders have disease flares during the first year of maintenance therapy, necessitating additional treatment interventions such as corticosteroids and immunomodulators (e.g. 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, azathioprine). Corticosteroids are not recommended by guideline panels for chronic therapy since these drugs are ineffective for maintaining remission and are associated with significant adverse events. Patients taking thiopurines require ongoing monitoring for hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, and opportunistic infections, as well as counseling on the potential risk of lymphoma. 
 Current medical therapies for the treatment of UC suppress the immune system rather than reduce the triggers of immune activation. We believe there remains an unmet need for safer agents with novel non-immunosuppressive mechanisms of action. Moreover, alternative therapy is needed for patients with mild-to-moderate UC who experience frequent flares or are intolerant to the aminosalicylate class of medication or where there are safety concerns relating to the use of immunomodulator or steroid therapy.
 SER-287
 Given the modulation of the microbiome seen in UC patients, studies have explored the use of FMT to treat UC. (Angelberger et al., 2013; Colman and Rubin, 2014; Kump et al., 2013; Kunde et al., 2013; Moayyedi et al., 2015; Paramsothy et al., 2017; Costello SP et al JAMA 2019). Early reports of enhanced clinical remission and endoscopic improvement with repetitive FMT compared to placebo motivated the preclinical development and clinical testing of SER-287. 
 15

SER-287, an oral microbiome therapeutic candidate consisting of a consortium of highly purified Firmicute spores, is designed to normalize the gastrointestinal microbiome of individuals with UC. In December 2018, we commenced a three-arm placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial that was designed to evaluate SER-287 in approximately 201 patients with mild-to-moderate UC.  Two groups of patients are receiving different doses of SER-287, both following pre-conditioning with a short course of oral vancomycin. A third study arm will receive placebo. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate clinical remission measured after 10 weeks of SER-287 administration. Patients then enter a 2-week exploratory maintenance follow-up period.  Endoscopic improvement will be measured as a secondary efficacy measure.  Based on feedback from the FDA, if the data from this trial is positive, we expect that the Phase 2b clinical trial could be one of two pivotal trials to enable a BLA to be submitted for SER-287 for the treatment of UC. 
 There are approximately 700,000 UC patients in the United States and fewer than one-third of patients on current therapies achieve remission. Approved treatments are often inadequate to control disease activity and are often associated with significant side effects, including immunosuppression. We believe that SER-287 may address underlying drivers of inflammation in UC and, based on the favorable tolerability profile observed in our clinical trials of SER-287, we believe has the potential to be developed as both a foundational monotherapy, as well as a combination therapy with other UC drugs. SER-287 has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in adult subjects with active mild-to-moderate UC.  SER-287 has been designated an Orphan Drug for pediatric UC by the FDA.
 Further details of Phase 1b clinical study design 
 The Phase 1b clinical study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study utilizing weekly or daily dosing with SER-287. We enrolled eligible subjects at approximately 20 sites in the United States. The Phase 1b clinical study was designed to enroll adults 18 years of age and older who had mild-to-moderate UC as defined by a Total Modified Mayo score between 4 and 10, inclusive, with a modified Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥ 1, who were failing current therapies.
 Patients were randomized to one of four study arms: 
  
• | Pre-conditioning with placebo for 6 days, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pre-conditioning with placebo for 6 days, followed by daily dosing with placebo for 8 weeks
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pre-conditioning with vancomycin for 6 days, followed by daily dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pre-conditioning with vancomycin for 6 days, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-287 compared to placebo; to compare the baseline composition of the intestinal microbiome to the composition at 8 weeks post-initiation of SER-287 or placebo; and to determine the engraftment of SER-287 bacteria into the intestinal microbial community in each of the SER-287 arms compared to the placebo arm.
 The secondary objectives of the study were to determine the proportion of subjects in each of the treatment arms who at eight weeks post-initiation of treatment achieve a clinical response, complete remission, and endoscopic improvement; to assess changes in serum and fecal biomarkers from baseline throughout treatment; to determine the complement of metabolic pathways; and to compare the changes in exploratory biomarkers from mucosal biopsies and stool in each of the treatment arms from baseline through eight weeks.
 This study was designed to provide evidence of safety of SER-287 compared to placebo for the UC population, describe the changes in the microbiome as a result of treatment with SER-287 and provide potential predictive biomarkers for future studies. UC is characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity and richness, with a lower prevalence of spore-forming organisms within the phylum Firmicutes. Preliminary data using repetitive enema FMT suggest that microbial interventions can affect clinical outcomes in UC, and this study evaluated whether the ecology of bacterial spores in SER-287 could correct the modulation of the microbiome in UC, increase microbial diversity and safely lead to a clinical response in UC patients with mild-to-moderate disease.
 Phase 1b clinical study results  
 Results were analyzed using the intent to treat, or ITT, “missing equals failure” analysis and the ITT “observed case” analysis methods.  The ITT “missing equals failure” analysis, included all 58 randomized subjects. For this analysis, incalculable clinical endpoints due to missing data, UC medication added due to UC flare during the treatment period and discontinuation from the trial prior to Day 48 were considered as not achieving the clinical endpoints (worst outcome).  However, if the end-of-trial endoscopy at Day 48, or later, was available, and the subject did not take additional UC medication due to UC flare, then the observed data was used to define success or failure for the subject. A period of 48 days of microbiome therapy was considered sufficient treatment to estimate the outcome of clinical endpoints and was prespecified. The ITT “observed case” analysis included 53 of 58 subjects randomized, excluding those who were missing their end-of-treatment endoscopies and used the observed data to define success or 
 16

failure for each subject in the analysis. A paper titled “A Phase 1b Safety Study of SER-287, a Spore-Based Microbiome Therapeutic, For Active Mild-To-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis” was published as the highlighted over article in the January 2021 print edition of the leading journal Gastroenterology including data analysis from the Phase 1b trial of Ser-287 demonstrating that SER-287 administration was associated with positive impacts on clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, modulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and a favorable safety profile.
Clinical efficacy results 
 In the “missing equals failure” analysis, remission showed a statistically significant improvement in the vancomycin pre-conditioning / SER-287 once-daily dosing arm as compared to the placebo/placebo daily arm: 40% (6 of 15 in SER-287) vs 0% (0 of 11 in placebo); change from placebo of 40.0% (95% confidence interval: 15.2%, 64.8%), (p-value, 0.0237). (See Figure 1).
 The SER-287 weekly treatment arms also showed an improvement over placebo in both remission and endoscopic improvement but the effect was less than with the daily dosing regimen, showing a dose-response to SER-287 in these efficacy endpoints.  Addition of vancomycin to the SER-287 weekly dosing regimen did not clearly alter efficacy results, although we believe this may be due to the small size of the study.
 Clinical response (data not shown), showed a numeric increase in the vancomycin/SER287 daily treatment arm compared to placebo but did not reach statistical significance.

SER-287 Phase 1b Clinical Study Efficacy Data – Missing Equals Failure
 Legend: Δ = change from placebo; Remission was defined as a Total Modified Mayo score of less than or equal to 2, and an endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1; Endoscopic improvement was defined as a decrease in endoscopic sub score of greater than or equal to 1. Endoscopy measures were analyzed by a Central Reader.
Clinical Safety Results
 The primary safety objective (short-term safety) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-287 in adults with active mild-to-moderate UC up to 92 days after randomization as determined by clinical and laboratory safety assessments. 
 
The treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were balanced across all the treatment arms.  No drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported.  All adverse events, or AEs, were considered mild to moderate in intensity.  Gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders had the greatest number of AEs compared to other system organ classes, with the most efficacious treatment arm (vancomycin/SER-287 daily) experiencing the lowest percentage of GI AEs. 
 
SER-287 was observed to be well-tolerated in all treatment arms, showing a safety profile consistent with the placebo arm.  The safety profile, when evaluating GI AEs, showed an improvement in the vancomycin/SER-287 treatment arm compared to vancomycin/placebo and the vancomycin/SER-287 weekly treatment arms.  
 A paper titled “A Phase 1b Safety Study of SER-287, a Spore-Based Microbiome Therapeutic, For Active Mild-To-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis” was published as the highlighted over article in the January 2021 print edition of the leading journal Gastroenterology including data analysis from the Phase 1b trial of Ser-287 demonstrating that SER-287 administration was associated with positive impacts on clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, modulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and a favorable tolerability profile
 17

Microbiome results showed engraftment of SER-287-derived bacterial species in patients pre-conditioned with vancomycin who received SER-287. The degree of SER-287 engraftment, as measured by the number of detectable SER-287-derived bacterial species, increased in a dose-dependent manner, with daily dosing providing the most rapid and robust change in patients’ microbiome. Engraftment was maintained during the entire dosing period and was observed four weeks after the last dose of SER-287 was administered. Thus, engraftment was durable. Changes in the composition of the GI microbiome were associated with clinical remission and further associated with changes in stool metabolite and intestinal biopsy gene expression signatures associated with inflammation and immune modulation. Vancomycin pre-conditioning, as compared to placebo pre-conditioning, led to an immediate reduction of microbiome diversity followed by rapid and robust engraftment of SER-287-derived bacterial species. These data suggest that vancomycin pre-conditioning opens ecological niches for SER-287 engraftment in the human microbiome of patients with UC.

Phase 2b clinical study design
 Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe that the results from the SER-287 Phase 2b ECO-RESET study in conjunction with data from a second pivotal study designed to also evaluate maintenance, could enable submission of a SER-287 Biologics License Application.
 
The Phase 2b study, initiated in December 2018, is a three-arm placebo-controlled trial of approximately 200 patients with active mild-to-moderate UC. Two groups of patients will receive different doses of SER-287, both following pre-conditioning with a short course of oral vancomycin. A third study arm will receive placebo. The study’s primary endpoint will evaluate clinical remission measured after 10 weeks of SER-287 administration. Endoscopic improvement will be measured as a secondary efficacy measure.
 SER-301
 SER-301, is an investigational, oral, microbiome therapeutic candidate comprised of a consortium of cultivated bacteria for the treatment of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). SER-301 is a consortium of cultivated bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform that incorporates analysis of microbiome biomarkers from human clinical data and preclinical assessments using human cell-based assays and in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo disease models. SER-301 is designed to reduce induction of pro-inflammatory activity, improve epithelial barrier integrity and TNF-α driven inflammation in IECs, and modulate UC-relevant anti-inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune pathways. SER-301 is being produced by our advanced fermentation, formulation and delivery platforms.  It includes strains delivered in spore form, as well as strains fermented in non-spore (vegetative) form and delivered using enterically-protected technology designed to release in the colon.  
 Phase 1b clinical study design. 
 The SER-301 Phase 1b study is being conducted in Australia and New Zealand in subjects with mild-to-moderate UC and is designed to include approximately 65 patients distributed across two cohorts. A first open-label cohort of 15 subjects will evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics (PK), as measured by bacterial engraftment. In the second cohort, 50 subjects will be randomized to receive either SER-301 or placebo, with a 3:2 randomization, respectively. The study utilizes an independent blinded central reader for the endoscopic component. The objectives for this cohort are to evaluate safety and PK, clinical remission, and other measures of drug pharmacology and efficacy will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.
 
Other Programs
 SER-155
 SER-155, an oral consortium of cultivated bacteria is a microbiome therapeutic candidate that we are advancing into clinical development. The rationale for this program is based in part on published clinical evidence from our collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center showing that allo-HSCT patients with decreased diversity of commensal microbes are significantly more likely to die due to infection and/or lethal graft versus host disease, or GvHD. SER-155 is consortia of cultivated bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform to prevent mortality due to gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia and GvHD in immunocompromised patients, including in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) or solid organ transplants. SER-155 is designed to decrease infection and translocation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and modulate host immune responses to decrease GvHD. In November 2017, we were awarded a highly competitive grant from CARB-X to support continued preclinical research and early development work for SER-155. In 2019, Seres was awarded additional funding from CARB-X to support clinical development of SER-155, including support through IND filing and Phase 1b evaluation. The 2019 CARB-X grant provides us with an additional $4.8 million of funding for research, manufacture, and IND submission, with potential for an additional $7.0 million for Phase 1b development, upon completion of milestones.  We expect to initiate clinical development of SER-155 in the first half of 2021.  
 
SER-401
 We are also developing SER-401, for use with CPIs in patients with solid tumors to enhance efficacy and improve survival. SER-401, an oral consortium of purified bacteria is a microbiome therapeutic candidate comprising a bacterial signature similar to that observed in checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy responders. In March 2019, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b clinical study 
 18

with MD Anderson and PICI, to evaluate SER-401’s potential to augment the response of anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The study is designed to enroll 30 patients with metastatic melanoma who are being treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients are randomized at a 2-to-1 ratio to either SER-401 or placebo. The study’s primary endpoints are to evaluate safety and tolerability. Its secondary endpoints are to evaluate the correlation of microbiome biomarkers of response to various clinical and immunological outcome measures.
 We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on company operations and ongoing clinical development activity, including on the SER-401 Phase 1b study in metastatic melanoma. Mitigation activities to minimize COVID-19-related operation disruptions are ongoing, however, given the severity and evolving nature of the situation, the timing of the SER-401 Phase 1b clinical readout is uncertain.
 Sales and Marketing
 If SER-109 is approved in the United States and Canada, we believe it can be commercialized with a focused specialty sales force that will target gastrointestinal and infectious disease physicians, which are the two primary groups of physicians who treat recurrent CDI patients. In preparation for ECOSPOR III regulatory submissions, we have initiated commercial readiness activities that include: C. difficile market assessments, publication and presentation planning, stakeholder and advocacy relationship mapping, brand name selection, and initiation of payer and reimbursement strategic planning.
 In January 2016, we entered into an agreement with Nestec Ltd., which was succeeded in interest by Société des Produits Nestlé S.A., or Nestlé, for the development and commercialization outside of the United States and Canada of our product candidates in development for CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn’s disease. The agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada and provide financial support for our ongoing research and development.
 Manufacturing
 The production of live bacterial products is highly specialized. Owing to their hardiness and environmental persistence, production of spore-forming organisms poses unique considerations for product, personnel, and facility protection. Manufacturing activities with spores are subject to specialized regulations. We expect that a typical commercial fermentation will yield on the order of hundreds or thousands of doses per liter depending on the product and its composition. Additionally, because a given total dose is split between several strains, the per-strain requirements for production may be even lower. As a result, we believe the high productivity relative to the dose level will enable production scales for both clinical and commercial supply to be modest.
 We have developed supply chains for producing and testing materials to ensure the availability of future clinical trial supplies. Our development processes are designed to ensure that the raw materials, process technologies and analytical tests we use are scalable and transferable to a cGMP manufacturing environment. These include the following core elements:
  
• | Fermentation. We are using microscale screening to optimize culture of the bacterial strains of interest in our current and foreseeable product candidates. These screens are designed to identify the fermentation platform that is best-suited for optimization and scale-up of the strains. Small-scale fermentation systems (0.1 L to 50 L) enable the optimization of a wide variety of culture conditions and have been demonstrated to be scalable to larger fermentation processes and enable technology transfer to clinical and final manufacturing sites. We employ platform fermentation processes as starting points for cGMP production processes and develop strain specific processes as required. To develop master cell banks, working cell banks, and bulk drug substance for commercial product, we are using bacterial strains originating from a unique research cell bank precursor, so we expect the research cell banks and final drug product should be genetically and physiologically similar.

• | Purification. Similar to fermentation, we believe small-scale purification operations are available for assessing large-scale cGMP manufacturing of live cells, and to quickly assess downstream process yield, quality and robustness. For our oral products, purification is typically less complex than for parenteral biologics such as monoclonal antibodies that must purify away very similar components from the culturing process. Separation of viable microbes from soluble fermentation broth components is typically much simpler. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Formulation. Our microbiome therapeutic candidates are combinations of bacteria and can be administered by a number of methods and by different routes. The primary goal in developing a formulation is to deliver bacteria to the intended location in a condition where they are able to replicate and modulate the microbiome. Formulation development generally uses approved excipients and preservatives, and will include screening of liquid, solid, and suspension formulations to maximize the opportunity for extended stability with minimal cold-chain requirements. Dosage forms for oral products may be capsules, tablets, sachets, or liquid containers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Analytical. We are addressing quality control requirements for our microbiome therapeutic candidates using proprietary microbiological, chemical, biochemical, and molecular sequence-based testing schemes. We have available and are further developing quality control and in-process analytical tools that can quantitatively measure the composition of spore, vegetative microbe and spore/vegetative combinations, which we believe enable a wide variety of drug products to be manufactured. Throughout the bioprocess and formulation development platform we use and will expand on quantitative analytics to assess the identity, potency and purity of the final product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently have a 10,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing facility at our headquarters where we conduct cGMP manufacture of therapeutic candidates to support drug substance and drug product for early phase and small-scale clinical supplies and with the ability to perform both drug substance and drug product manufacturing for early and late-phase clinical development and at larger scales of operation. We may establish further manufacturing facilities that will serve late-phase clinical and commercial supply for our product candidates. We may do this by expanding our current facilities, or by purchasing or building additional facilities. We also use contract manufacturing and testing organizations to supplement our internal capacity. 
 Material Agreements
 Collaboration Agreements
 Agreement with Nestlé
 In January 2016, we entered into the Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Nestec, Ltd., which was succeeded in interest by Société des Produits Nestlé S.A., or Nestlé, an affiliate of Nestlé Health Science US Holdings, Inc., both of which are significant stockholders of ours, for the development and commercialization of certain product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn’s disease. The License Agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada, or the Licensed Territory. We have retained full commercial rights to our entire portfolio of product candidates with respect to the United States and Canada. 
 Under the License Agreement, we granted to Nestlé an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize, in the Licensed Territory, certain products based on our microbiome technology that are being developed for the treatment of CDI and IBD, including SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-301, or collectively, the Nestlé Collaboration Products. The License Agreement sets forth our and Nestlé’s respective obligations for development, commercialization, regulatory and manufacturing and supply activities for the Nestlé Collaboration Products with respect to the licensed fields and the Licensed Territory. 
 In exchange for the license, Nestlé made an upfront cash payment to us of $120.0 million. Nestlé also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of Nestlé Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. Under the License Agreement we are eligible to receive up to $285.0 million in development milestone payments, $375.0 million in regulatory payments and up to an aggregate of $1,125.0 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of Nestlé Collaboration Products. 
 In November 2018, we executed a letter agreement with Nestlé, or the Letter Agreement, modifying certain terms of the License Agreement. Under the Letter Agreement, Nestlé agreed to accelerate the payment of the $20.0 million Phase 3 commencement milestone to be payable upon the commencement of the Phase 2b study for SER-287. Further, based on the results of the Phase 2b study, the Letter Agreement modifies certain terms and conditions related to the extent and timing of expense reimbursement associated with the ongoing SER-287 clinical trials. The Phase 2b study was initiated and the $40.0 million of milestone payments were received in December 2018.
 To date, we have received $80.0 million in development milestones under the License Agreement with Nestlé.
 Agreement with AstraZeneca
 In March 2019, we entered into a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement, or the Research Agreement, with MedImmune, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca Inc., or AstraZeneca to conduct certain research and development activities with the goal of advancing the mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in augmenting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, including potential synergy with AstraZeneca compounds in accordance with a mutually agreed research plan. AstraZeneca bore all costs of conducting its activities under the Research Agreement and reimbursed us for certain of our costs incurred under the Research Agreement and paid us a total of $20.0 million in three equal installments, the first of which we received in April 2019, the second of which we received in December 2019 and third of which we received in January 2021. 
 
20

In December 2020, we received written notice from AstraZeneca that they elected to terminate the Research Agreement by and in accordance with its terms. The termination of the Research Agreement will be effective on April 2, 2021 (the “Termination Date”), which is 120 days from the date of the termination notice. 
 Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules
 In October 2019, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules, pursuant to which a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million, or the Term Loan Facility, is available to us in three tranches. We received the first tranche of $25.0 million upon signing the agreement on October 29, 2019. We did not meet the milestone requirements for the second tranche under the Term Loan Facility, and as such, the additional amount up to $12.5 million is not available for us to borrow. The third tranche, which allows us to borrow an additional $12.5 million, will be available upon Hercules’ approval on or prior to June 30, 2021.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that is important to our business, including seeking and, if granted, maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also utilize regulatory exclusivity as well as trade secrets to protect aspects of our business.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture and methods for patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position and, in the future, may rely on or leverage in-licensing opportunities. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover our product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter, and we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention.
 Our patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents and patent applications in various stages of prosecution, including ex-U.S. international counterparts. We believe that issued claims will provide protection for our microbiome therapeutic candidates.
 Patent Term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional, patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA- approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended 
 21

expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically utilize trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Competition
 The development and commercialization of new drug and biologic products is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. We are aware of a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as smaller, early-stage companies, that are pursuing the development of products, including microbiome therapeutics, and disease indications we are targeting. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.
 These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing sales and marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of the product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, especially for any competitor developing a microbiome therapeutic which will likely share our same regulatory approval requirements. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of lower cost products.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory 
 22

approvals and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. 
 The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before a trial is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication, conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determination by FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Preclinical and Clinical Trials
 Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which must be conducted in accordance with GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 23

For purposes of BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1 — The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 — The investigational product is typically administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 — The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and FDA Review
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee unless a waiver is granted or exemption applies.
 Each BLA submitted to the FDA is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days of the FDA’s receipt of the application. If the BLA is found to be complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information.
 Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing, but the overall timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility or facilities in which it is manufactured meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also refer the application to an Advisory Committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that such trials were conducted in compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter 
 24

authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new biologics designed to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to expedite the development and review of qualifying product candidates. 
 A new biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor meetings with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Product candidates receiving Fast Track status may also be eligible for Priority Review, if the relevant criteria are met.
 In addition, a biologic product candidate may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for Priority Review if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Additionally, product candidates are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process.

Post-Approval Requirements
 Approved biologics that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for products marketed pursuant to approved applications.
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals remain subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers and contract manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS programs. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, untitled lets, or holds on clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, 
 26

structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Further, if a designated orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan designation, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Clinical trials
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, or EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant member state(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed. 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal 
 27

representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect by early 2022, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.  Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national regulators provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned. 
 Marketing Authorizations
In the European Union, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 Centralized procedure—Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this opinion is favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (excluding clock stops), when a medicinal product targets an unmet medical need and is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops. 
 National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
  
• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU member states of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU member states and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. National MAs will be issued by competent authorities of the EU member states for their respective territory.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU member states in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 In the EU, upon receiving a MA, new chemical entities (i.e., reference products) generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of the market exclusivity period a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced but no generic or biosimilar can be marketed  in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes.  For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the European Union. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Orphan Medicinal Products
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a MA, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 Pediatric Development
 In the European Union, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all Member States and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-months 
 29

supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan pharmaceutical products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.  
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another. 
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA (comprised of the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).
 Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biotechnology industry, which include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, and transparency laws regarding drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts and free or reduced-price items and services. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors.
 The False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on persons who, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly make, use, or cause to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly make a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, and has obtained multi-million and multi–billion-dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 30

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act on certain manufacturers of drugs covered by a federal healthcare program for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals beginning in 2022 and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, and pricing information and marketing expenditures.
 To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to drug manufacturers may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, reporting obligations and integrity oversight, and imprisonment.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit, or hinder, coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products, as well as provide rebates and discounts which may impact the net selling price of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of pharmaceutical and biological products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. Conducting such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. Recent budgetary pressures in many countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for 
 31

any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for pharmaceutical and biological products under government health care programs. Among other things, the ACA:
  
• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of ‘‘average manufacturer price,’’ or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service utilization, to Medicaid managed care utilization, and created an alternate rebate formula for new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. With the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 70% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes the penalties for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance.  On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, enacted in August 2011, among other things, included reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biological products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including our product candidates if approved.

Data Privacy and Security
 We may also be subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
 In addition, certain state govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. In addition, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.
 Human Capital
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 155 full-time permanent employees. 25 employees work in administration and operations and 130 work in research and development. A portion of our personnel costs are reimbursable under our grant from CARB-X.  None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.  During 2020, we enhanced our capabilities by adding 55 new full-time employees. The new employees were hired to support a variety of functions and key initiatives, including extending our research, clinical and pre-clinical pipeline development, as well as our medical affairs, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities, with hires in commercial, clinical development and operations, research, medical affairs, manufacturing, and general and administrative functions. We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2021, with a focus on further enhancing our capabilities and increasing our capacities in these areas, as well as expanding our geographic reach as we continue our focus on gaining FDA approval for SER-109 for recurrent CDI.
 Talent Acquisition and Development
 We consider the intellectual capital, skills and experience of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, and we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. To attract qualified applicants to our company and retain our employees, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus targeting the 50th  to 75th percentile of the market based on geography, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for every employee. Annual cash bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Any actual bonus payout is based on a combination of individual performance and corporate performance

Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
 As a microbiome therapeutics company developing a novel class of live biotherapeutic drugs, we believe that our long-term success and ability to deliver innovative, safe and effective medicines to patients requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We value diversity at all levels of the organization and continue to focus on extending our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from: working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse, high performing teams; to ensuring that we attract, develop and retain diverse talent from all backgrounds; to increasing awareness within our company of unconscious biases, and supporting affinity groups comprised of individuals who are underrepresented in our company, industry or society, such as women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color. In addition, we pride ourselves on an open culture that respects co-workers, values employees’ health and well-being and fosters professional development. We support employee growth and development in a variety of ways including with group training, individual mentoring and coaching, conference attendance and tuition reimbursement. Our management conducts annual employee engagement surveys and reports to our board of directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, employee development and retention, and compensation and benefits. Similarly, our board of directors regularly provides input on important decisions relating to these matters, including with respect to employee compensation and benefits, talent retention and development.
COVID-19 Pandemic 
 We are operating at a unique time, as we face a serious public safety crisis because of the COVID-19 virus. We remain focused on continuing to serve clinical trial patients, as well as protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we live and work. In early March 2020, we activated a task force designed to assess, mitigate and manage the risks related to COVID-19 to avoid or minimize business disruption, including safeguarding of our facilities, and to ensure the safety and sense of security for our staff. In early March 2020, we closed all sites to non-essential employees, and we have suspended all non-essential travel indefinitely. We continue to keep all our sites closed to non-essential employees and encourage remote working arrangements for employees. Office sites are being reconfigured to maintain physical distancing and we expect to adopt and implement additional precautions commensurate with any expansion of employees returning to worksites. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations.
