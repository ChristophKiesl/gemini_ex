Overview
 
Wireless Telecom Group, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, together with its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”), specializes in the design and manufacture of advanced radio frequency and microwave devices which enable the development, testing and deployment of wireless technology. The Company provides unique, highly customized and configured solutions which drive innovation across a wide range of traditional and emerging wireless technologies.
 
Wireless Telecom Group is comprised of five brands – Microlab, Boonton, Noisecom, CommAgility and Holzworth. The Company is organized as one reporting segment as of result of certain internal reorganizations occurring in the six to nine months prior to June 2020. Prior to June 2020, the Company was organized in three reporting segments. In June 2020 we determined that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280 Segment Reporting evaluates operating results and makes decisions on how to allocate resources at the consolidated level. Although the CODM reviews key performance indicators including bookings, shipments and gross profit at a product group level, this information by itself is not sufficient enough to make operating decisions. Rather, operating decisions are made based on review of consolidated profitability metrics rather than the individual results of each product group. The Company continues to report gross profit at the product group level. Our product groups are organized as follows: Radio Frequency Components (“RFC”) is comprised of our Microlab brand; Radio, Baseband, Software (“RBS”) is comprised of our CommAgility brand; and Test and Measurement (“T&M”) is comprised of our Boonton, Noisecom and Holzworth brands.
 
Our customers include wireless carriers, aerospace and defense companies, military and government agencies, satellite communication companies, network equipment manufacturers, tower companies, semiconductor companies, system integrators, neutral host providers, medical device manufacturers and other global technology companies.
 
Our products include components, modules, instruments, systems and software used across the lifecycle of wireless connectivity and communication development, deployment and testing. Our services include software customization, calibration, repair and maintenance. Our customers use these products in the development and deployment of long-term evolution (“LTE”) and 5G private networks, small cell solution development and deployment, 5G test environments, automated test environments, research labs, network densification and deployment, expansion and upgrade of distributed antenna systems, and medical device manufacturing In addition, the Company’s products are used in the development and testing of satellite communication systems, radar systems, semiconductor manufacturing, automotive electronics and avionics.
 
The consolidated financial statements for the 2020 fiscal year include the accounts of Wireless Telecom Group, Inc., doing business as, and operating under the trade name Noise Com, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries including Boonton Electronics Corporation, Microlab/FXR, Wireless Telecommunications Ltd., CommAgility Limited and Holzworth Instrumentation, Inc. The corporate website address is www.wirelesstelecomgroup.com. Noise Com, Inc., Boonton Electronics Corporation, Microlab/FXR, CommAgility Limited Ltd., and Holzworth Instrumentation, Inc. are hereinafter referred to as “Noisecom”, “Boonton”, “Microlab”, “CommAgility” and “Holzworth”, respectively.
 
Market
 
Since the Company’s incorporation in the State of New Jersey in 1985, it has been primarily engaged in supplying noise source components and instruments, electronic testing and measurement instruments, and radio frequency (“RF”) passive components to customers. With the CommAgility acquisition in February 2017, the Company expanded to include the delivery of digital signal processing hardware cards and the delivery, implementation and configuration of LTE and 5G physical layer and stack software. In February 2020, we acquired Holzworth which specializes in supplying signal generators and phase noise analyzers to global aerospace and defense companies, the semiconductor industry and government labs. Approximately 82% and 93% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, were derived from commercial customers. The remaining consolidated revenues (approximately 18% and 7% in 2020 and 2019, respectively) were comprised of revenues from the United States government (particularly the armed forces) and prime defense contractors.

Backlog
 
The Company’s consolidated backlog of firm orders to be shipped in the next twelve months was approximately $8.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to approximately $3.8 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog from the prior year is due to the addition of Holzworth, as well as an increase in CommAgility backlog. It is anticipated that the majority of the backlog orders at December 31, 2020 will be filled during the current year. The stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of Company revenues for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that the Company will realize a profit from the orders.
Inventory, Supplies and Manufacturing
 
The Company purchases components, devices and subassemblies from a wide variety of sources. The Company’s procurement policy requires maintaining adequate levels of raw materials inventory to minimize the Company’s production lead times with third-party suppliers and to improve the Company’s capacity to expedite fulfillment of customer orders. Although the procurement team focuses its efforts to work closely with its suppliers to avoid adverse effects of shortages or delays in delivery of inventories, delays in the future may have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two suppliers accounted for 14% of total consolidated inventory purchases, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, three suppliers accounted for 18%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of total consolidated inventory purchases.
 
The Company is not party to any long term contracts regarding the deliveries of its supplies and components. It generally purchases such items pursuant to written purchase orders of both the individual and blanket variety. Blanket purchase orders usually cover the purchase of a larger amount of items at fixed prices for delivery and payment on specific dates.
 
For Boonton and Noisecom products, the Company develops, designs, manufactures, assembles, calibrates and tests the products at our facility in Parsippany, New Jersey. Testing of Boonton and Noisecom products is generally accomplished at the end of the manufacturing process and is performed in-house, as are all quality control processes.
 
Approximately 46% of Microlab’s revenues are traced to products that are sourced from offshore vendors. The majority of Microlab products that come from offshore suppliers are subject to tariffs. The impact of tariffs has decreased our consolidated gross profit margin by approximately 1%. The remainder of Microlab products are designed and manufactured by the Company in Parsippany, New Jersey. All Microlab products are tested by the Company in Parsippany, New Jersey.

Warranty and Service
 
The Company typically provides one to three year warranties on all of its products covering both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective during the warranty period if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers.
 
In cases of defective products the customer typically returns them to the Company’s facility. The Company’s service personnel typically repair the defective items and ship them back to the customer. Generally, all servicing is done at the Company’s facility, and the Company charges its customers a fee for those service items that are not covered by warranty. If the defective product cannot be repaired, the Company typically replaces the product free of charge but unrepairable products are an infrequent occurrence.
 
Product Liability Coverage
 
The testing of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability to the Company. Product liability claims could be asserted against the Company by end-users of any of the Company’s products. The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage. No claims have been asserted for product liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device in the past five years.
Intellectual Property
