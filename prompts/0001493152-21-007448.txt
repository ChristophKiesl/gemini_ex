ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
EVmo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on June 21, 2016 under the name “YayYo, LLC.” The Company was subsequently converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to the unanimous written consent of our former manager and members in a transaction intended to be tax-free under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Conversion”). Pursuant to the Conversion, the members of YayYo, LLC have assigned, transferred, exchanged and converted their respective limited liability company membership interests of YayYo, LLC, into shares of common stock, par value $0.000001 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”). All of YayYo, LLC’s liabilities and assets were automatically transferred to the Company and the Company assumed ownership of such assets and liabilities upon the filing of the “Certificate of Conversion from a Delaware Limited Liability Company to a Delaware Corporation” with the State of Delaware pursuant to Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company now operates as a “C” corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
On August 12, 2017, we announced that we were shifting our primary corporate focus in the transportation/ridesharing industry from being an exclusive provider of transportation networks systems towards a more diversified operating company with a direct focus on the vehicle rental business and a related transportation network system.
 
Prior to March 2017, the Company’s operating expenses were covered almost entirely by start-up capital provided by its founder and financing from private investors. In March 2017, the Company launched a best-efforts offering pursuant to “Regulation A+” of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The offering was for up to 6,250,000 shares of Common Stock at $8.00 per share when a Form 1-A relating to this offering was qualified by the Securities & Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Then, on November 15, 2019, the Company completed its initial public offering of 2,625,000 shares of Common Stock, at $4.00 per share, for gross proceeds, before underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of $10.5 million and the shares became listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “YAYO.”
 
On February 10, 2020, the Company notified Nasdaq of its intent to voluntarily delist its Common Stock. In connection therewith, the Company filed a Form 25 with the SEC on or about February 20, 2020. The Company elected to effect the voluntary delisting of its common stock after discussions with Nasdaq’s staff, and based on the determination of the Company’s board of directors that voluntarily delisting the Common Stock from Nasdaq was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at that time. Since delisting from Nasdaq, our Common Stock has traded on the OTC Markets under the same ticker symbol.
 
In September 2020, we changed our name from YayYo, Inc. to Rideshare Rental, Inc., in order for our corporate brand to better reflect our principal businesses, ridesharing and vehicle rentals. In March 2021, we decided to change our name again, this time to EVmo, Inc., to underscore our commitment to making a full transition to electric vehicles over the next several years.

Overview
 
EVmo is a holding company operating principally through two wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Rideshare Car Rentals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Rideshare”), and (ii) Distinct Cars, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Distinct Cars”). Rideshare offers an online bookings platform to service the ridesharing and delivery gig industries (the “Rideshare Platform”). Distinct Cars maintains a fleet of passenger vehicles and transit vans for the last-mile logistical space for rent to our customers. Through Rideshare and Distinct Cars, the Company seeks to become the leading provider of rental vehicles to drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig spaces, and an industry leader in supplying transit vans for last-mile logistics. In March 2021, we formed another wholly-owned subsidiary, EV Vehicles LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we intend to utilize as the corporate platform to execute our electric vehicles strategy.
The Rideshare Platform
 
On October 31, 2017, the Company created Rideshare to incubate the concept of the Rideshare Platform, which is a proprietary, peer-to-peer booking platform, intended to rent passenger vehicles to self-employed ridesharing drivers. The Company has since deployed and launched the Rideshare Platform on the Company’s e-commerce website, http://www.ridesharerental.com. The Rideshare Platform also commercially markets the Company’s own fleet of cars as well as those of other fleet owners and selected individual car owners, providing them with an opportunity to monetize their vehicles by renting them out to ridesharing drivers. Our business strategy with our Rideshare Platform is to further develop and expand our brand equity and establish ourselves as the premier peer-to-peer Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) vehicle rental business for the ridesharing and delivery gig industries that matches the owners and/or operators of passenger vehicles (including the Company’s fleet of maintained vehicles) to existing or prospective ridesharing and delivery gig drivers. The Company initially launched the Rideshare Platform in Los Angeles, CA and has since expanded it into multiple other markets, including Oakland, CA; Las Vegas, NV; Chicago, IL; Newark, NJ; Baltimore, MD; and Dallas, TX.
 
The Rideshare Platform’s functionality provides drivers with access to certain data emitted from their respective Company rental vehicle(s) through a personal Rideshare dashboard. Vehicle owners can also access and manage data emitted from their personal vehicle(s) under rental to a third-party from the Rideshare Platform inventory dashboard and can further manage the other aspects of the vehicle rental transaction through the Rideshare Platform, including rental extension options. All transactional aspects of the rental vehicle(s) (including, but not limited to, background checks, terms, deposits and insurance costs) are run securely through the Rideshare Platform. In addition, our Rideshare website not only effectively monetizes Company-owned vehicle fleets, made available through Distinct Cars, but also generates revenue by charging transactional fees to other vehicle owners and ridesharing and delivery gig drivers for all rental transactions consummated on the Rideshare Platform. The Rideshare Platform is available on desktop, iOS and Android devices. The development and functionality of our mobile applications are a material component to our business as drivers are more likely to transact via mobile devices.
 
Most importantly, all passenger vehicles and transit vans made available on the Rideshare Platform are fully qualified by the Company and guaranteed to meet the necessary qualification requirements.
 
The Company believes that due to the rapid development of the ridesharing and delivery gig economies and their anticipated growth trajectories, these markets will continue to reward the Company as an early entrant to the third-party vehicle rental business. Under the Rideshare Platform we intend to become the go-to booking destination and brand for ridesharing and delivery gig vehicle rentals in a TNC marketplace that connects owners and/or operators of standard and, increasingly, electric passenger vehicles and transit vans for the last-mile logistical space, with ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers. We believe that our product and service offerings on the Rideshare Platform will continue to be an attractive proposition for all ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers either simply requiring a standard passenger vehicle to operate, or preferring an electric vehicle, or struggling to qualify their personal vehicles under vehicle inspection requirements. While the Company will require additional capital investment to continue funding Rideshare and the Rideshare Platform, including furthering our technology, facilitating payments to us, and advertising, we believe there is a strong opportunity to grow and scale the Rideshare Platform in both existing and new geographical territories for purposes of developing and strengthening the Company’s brand and competitive advantage in the ridesharing and delivery gig vehicle rental markets.

Insurance
 
As of the date of this Report, the Company, together with our managing general underwriter, American Business Insurance Services, Inc. (the “MGU”), maintains an insurance policy on behalf of the Company. Under the policy the MGU handles all back-end insurance generation and processing through an application programming interface (API) connection with the Company’s databases. We believe that this MGU insurance policy has made it possible for us to maintain our Rideshare Platform, which allows the Company to have other third-party fleet owners supply vehicles to drivers through our platform and have them covered under the terms of our insurance policy. Our insurance policy provides physical damage and liability coverage to all rideshare drivers under the Rideshare Platform. Under the terms of our policy, both Rideshare Platform drivers acquiring vehicles through Fleet Management (as defined below) as well as owners of their own vehicles are provided with an insurance ID card that lists each party’s name and the vehicle VIN number. Our Rideshare Platform customers pay daily (for the duration of the rental period) to become designated as a supplemental insured party under the Company’s insurance policy. Under the terms of our policy, insurance coverage is valid from the date of commencement of the rental period up until the date that the vehicle is returned.
 
Further, the Company’s car liability and physical damage insurance policies cover both third-party vehicle owners as well as ridesharing and delivery gig drivers under rental contract. These policies provide insurance on all listed vehicles, provided that the coverage is suspended during periods when the ridesharing driver under rental contract with the Company is actively operating on either the Uber or Lyft platform.
 
Distinct Cars Fleet Management Business
 
On June 10, 2017, the Company formed Distinct Cars for the purpose of developing a fleet management business (“Fleet Management”). Fleet Management maintains a fleet of new standard and, increasingly, electric passenger vehicles and transit vans for the logistical space to be rented directly to drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig economies through the Rideshare Platform. The Company’s fleet of vehicles, under lease contract and maintained by Distinct Cars, as well as other third-party vehicles have been made commercially available for rental bookings on the Rideshare Platform. The Company seeks to provide drivers in the ridesharing and delivery gig markets with full-service vehicle rentals and fleet contract maintenance solutions for commercial standard and electric passenger vehicles, as well as transit vans in the logistical space. As a provider of comprehensive, integrated vehicle rental and management solutions, Fleet Management markets and manages short and long-term vehicle rentals to ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers. As of the date of this Report, approximately half of these drivers are located in greater Los Angeles while the other half are located in the other six cities where we have operations.
 
The Company is focused on operating, developing and investing in its vehicle rental business with a focus on marketing directly to the peer-to-peer car sharing and ridesharing industry professionals. The Company is capable of meeting customers’ needs, including but not limited to a guaranty that all vehicles maintained under Fleet Management will comply with and pass the Ridesharing Qualification Requirements. Fleet Management product and service offering includes full-service vehicle rental(s) and contract maintenance, along with distribution center management and transportation management service. As of the date of this Report, the Company’s customer base is primarily ridesharing and delivery gig drivers located within our markets that are operating and performing driving services on behalf of a host of the private ridesharing and delivery TNCs (primarily Lyft and Uber in ridesharing, and DoorDash and GrubHub for delivery). The Company hopes to aggressively expand our Fleet Management services and product offerings nationally.
 
In August 2017, following our announcement that we were shifting our primary corporate operations, we entered into a leasing arrangement for an initial group of twelve (12) vehicles, with the intent of testing our Fleet Management concept within the ridesharing industry. Following the Company’s proof of concept period, we expanded our Fleet Management business in December 2017 by adding an additional 135 vehicles to our fleet. As of March 24, 2021, Fleet Management includes a fleet of approximately 626 vehicles- including standard and electric passenger vehicles as well as transit vans for the last-mile logistical space- under lease contract. Generally, professional ridesharing and delivery gig economy drivers contract with private ridesharing TNCs for vehicle rental periods generally ranging from less than three days to six months. The rental vehicles made available to customers by the Company are configured and guaranteed to be compliant with the same vehicle inspection requirements imposed on ridesharing (not delivery) vehicles by the largest private ridesharing TNCs (specifically, Uber and Lyft).

The Company believes that customers will rent vehicles offered by our Fleet Management business in order to reduce the complexity, cost and total capital associated with vehicle ownership. Further, we believe that due to our market focus on the ridesharing industry and the additional imposition of the ridesharing qualification requirements imposed on ridesharing vehicles by the dominant private ridesharing TNCs, our customers will be further incentivized to rent our Fleet Management vehicles to guarantee compliance with those requirements.
 
Under a full-service rental agreement, the Company provides and fully maintains the vehicle, which is generally specifically configured to meet the ridesharing qualification requirements. The services provided under full-service rental and contract maintenance agreements generally include preventive and regular maintenance, advanced diagnostics, emergency road service, fleet services, and safety programs, through our company-operated facilities.
 
Fleet Management Software
 
The Company has been an early adopter of technologies to leverage the Fleet Management business. To ensure that the Company’s fleet of vehicles meet and comply with the standard ridesharing qualification requirements and transmit relevant data to our customers, the Company has fit its Fleet Management vehicles with our proprietary fleet management GPS solution software, providing open platform fleet management solutions to businesses of all sizes. These full-featured solutions help the Company manage its drivers and vehicles by extracting accurate and actionable intelligence from real-time and historical location trip data. The telematics solutions for fleet optimization provide our Fleet Management vehicles with fitted software analytics and data involving (i) fuel efficiency; (ii) management of vehicle maintenance and (iii) prevention of vehicle wear and tear.
Commercial Partnership Programs
 
In June 2017, the Company entered into a strategic partnership arrangement with Hyundai USA, a subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) for purposes of entering into a fleet purchase program. The Hyundai program has provided the Company with competitive pricing options (or best available pricing) below manufacturer suggested retail prices on all purchases for brand-new Hyundai vehicles and priority status on the availability and delivery of all Hyundai vehicles under contract with the Company. The vehicle purchases are currently financed by ACME Auto Leasing and LMP Financial Services, with title to the vehicles held by the Company under liens held by the financiers.
 
The Company has entered into a similar partnership program with Hyundai’s affiliate, Kia Motors America, Inc., and in March 2021 we entered into a separate partnership with Tesla, Inc., which is intended to facilitate our strategy to transition to all-electric vehicles.
 
Our Business Model and Our Future Opportunities
 
We have developed what we believe is an innovative business model in which we not only provide ridesharing and delivery gig drivers with the necessary technology to operate, through the Rideshare Platform, but also the vehicles themselves, via Fleet Management, should the driver not have a qualified vehicle to use. Our two principal operating subsidiaries have a rare corporate synergy that enables us to both diversify and create complementary revenue streams. Further, as we continue our transition to all-electric vehicles, we believe we are in the vanguard of a new era in commercial transportation and that our early presence in this industry will further distinguish us from a competitive standpoint.
 
While we cannot at this time assess the ultimate effect of COVID-19 and its resulting restrictions on our Company, as of the date of this Report these restrictions appear to be slowly abating. We believe that consumer options in ridesharing will continue to expand to an even larger audience, such as carpooling and private bus services. The expansion of consumer options has also attracted mass transit customers to more expensive luxury options. Our Fleet Management business is designed to put more certified ridesharing vehicles on the roadways to meet the increasing consumer demand of the availability of ridesharing services.

Moreover, our entry during 2020 into the delivery gig space has provided us with another form of service diversity, one with fewer barriers to entry, as the requirements for vehicles operated by delivery gig drivers are significantly less onerous than those operated by rideshare drivers, as delivery gig drivers are not transporting people. The increasing demand for ridesharing and delivery gig services has produced an increase in demand by TNC businesses for more ridesharing and delivery gig drivers and vehicles on the road at any given time. The growing demographic of ridesharing and delivery gig drivers, as determined on a global basis, has drawn drivers to these industries to perform services for a host of private TNC businesses, such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and GrubHub. The Company estimates that private TNC businesses are hiring more than 50,000 drivers a month to keep pace with the current commercial demand for ridesharing and delivery gig services.
 
Vehicle and Driver Requirements
 
We believe that many potential ridesharing drivers are deterred from applying for or are turned away from employment by certain TNCs on account of the fact that their personal vehicles would fail or are failing to meet the qualification requirements imposed by those TNCs. We address this directly by enabling such drivers to rent vehicles from us, through Fleet Management. Each of our vehicles meets if not exceeds the qualification requirements we impose on privately-owned vehicles operated by prospective rideshare drivers.
Ridesharing and Delivery Gig Qualification Requirements
 
Before initiating employment of a driver using his or her own vehicle, we screen and evaluate the prospective driver and we obtain a Motor Vehicle Report (“MVR”) for his or her vehicle, if the driver does not intend to rent a vehicle from our fleet. We obtain a new MVR for a vehicle not from our fleet that utilizes the Rideshare Platform every six months.
 
We, and other TNCs, generally impose the following requirements on potential ridesharing and delivery gig driver applicants seeking employment:
 

● | The driver must have reached a minimum age of 21 years old; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The ridesharing driver must have in-state auto insurance with the driver’s name on the policy; 
● | The ridesharing driver must have an in-state driver’s license, and been licensed in the U.S. for at least one year; 
● | The ridesharing driver must have in-state plates with a current registration (commercial plates are acceptable as well); 
● | The ridesharing driver must have a clean driving record; and 
● | The ridesharing driver must pass a background check; and 
● | The ridesharing driver’s vehicle must pass certain qualification requirements, such as the following: 


○ | The vehicle must be a four-door car whose year of manufacture is not earlier than the designated cut-off year; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | The vehicle must be in good physical condition with no cosmetic damage; 
○ | No marketing or commercial branding is being outwardly displayed on the vehicle; and 
○ | The vehicle must receive a passing score on a 19-point vehicle inspection. 

 
As mentioned above, certain cosmetic features may prevent a potential ridesharing driver’s vehicle from qualifying under the vehicle inspection on account of the following: (i) the vehicle includes a full-body wrap containing advertisements, or any large ads; (ii) the vehicle has holes or damage to the exterior; (iii) the vehicle has taxi decals or taxi-style paint; (iv) the vehicle has significant damage to the interior (including any torn seats, large permanent stains, strong permanent odors); (v) the vehicle has paint oxidation; or (vi) the vehicle has different colored hoods/doors; and (vii) the vehicle has objectionable aftermarket modification.

As also noted above, we, as well as other private ridesharing companies, also require all potential ridesharing drivers to undergo a vehicle inspection test on all personal driver vehicles to be used by the potential ridesharing driver to perform ridesharing services on behalf of the private ridesharing company. A 19-point inspection is a standard vehicle inspection procedure to check a car in 19 specific areas to ensure that it conforms to safety and operational requirements. While the 19 points are typically the same for different companies, their procedures differ slightly. The process also varies based on the geographical location where the inspection is performed. The 19 points of the vehicle checked for inspection include headlights, tail-lights, indicator lights, stop lights, foot brakes, emergency/parking brake, steering mechanism, windshield, heat and air conditioning, front, rear and side windows, front seat adjustment mechanism, door controls (open, close, lock), horn, speedometer, body condition/ damage, muffler and exhaust system, condition or tires, interior and exterior rear-view mirrors and safety belts for driver and passengers. Any vehicle having a problem or issue with any of the inspection points will generally not pass the vehicle inspection and we will refuse the opportunity to become a ridesharing driver for us.
 
Company Growth Strategy
 
Our long-term strategy is focused on four priorities: expanding and diversifying our revenues; improving our operating effectiveness; enhancing the customer experience; and disciplined capital management.
 
Expand and Diversify Revenues—Our strategy to achieve ongoing growth is driven by initiatives that expand and diversify our revenues through customer- and market-focused initiatives. We are actively working to expand our Fleet Management business and use of the Rideshare Platform and we intend to convert our entire fleet inventory over to electric vehicles. We will continue to offer a comprehensive equipment rental fleet to maintain and hopefully grow our market position. We plan to continue to expand our footprint in North America, with a focus on increasing the following: (i) the number of major geographical markets served on our Rideshare Platform; (ii) the number of vehicles maintained and managed under the Company’s Fleet Management business, with a strong focus on adding electric vehicles, which will eventually constitute our entire fleet population; and (iii) to continue to reinforce our existing locations with additional fleet and enhance our expertise tailored to local markets. Our footprint expansion will include new locations served under our Rideshare Platform and Fleet Management operations to better support our growing ridesharing rental business. We will continue to pursue initiatives that allow us to drive sales through our existing locations and geographical territories.
 
Improve Operating Effectiveness—We are focused on generating continuous improvement across our operations, with an emphasis on building a strong safety culture, fleet management business, e-commerce bookings website, fleet availability and improving margins. We are continuing to build a highly professional and technology-enabled sales force and to optimize our sales territories to support our revenue growth objectives. We will continue to improve the effectiveness of our sales team with focused training, strong customer relationship management capabilities, and ongoing technology enhancements.
 
Enhance the Customer Experience—We seek to differentiate our business by delivering a superior customer experience through the variety and quality of the vehicles and services we offer, the ease of doing business with us and the added value we offer through services, products and technologies. Our focus on quality vehicle brands tailored to meet the qualification requirements of the ridesharing industry is intended to meet the needs and preferences of ridesharing drivers, including the expectations for reliable, safe, efficient and effective maintained vehicles. We expect to add more expertise across our team to help our customers achieve the best results for their projects. In developing and providing vehicle rental related technologies, we are focused on meeting customer expectations related to convenience and on-demand access to data and information.
 
Disciplined Asset Management—We manage our vehicle rental fleet to optimize the timing of fleet rentals, repairs and maintenance, while at the same time satisfying our customers’ needs. Through continued use and development of our disciplined approach to efficient fleet management, we seek to maximize our utilization and return on investment.

Intellectual Property
 
As of the date of this Report, we have two registered trademarks “YayYo®” and the service mark for a stylized design representing an automobile that is present in our web sites and our marketing materials. We have no applications for other trademarks as of the date of this Report. We have no patents or copyrights.
Human Capital 
 
As of the date of this Report, we had approximately 35 full-time employees, all of which are based at our offices. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees generally are good.
Regulation 
 
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. In addition to the foregoing, we are also subject to the following:

● | Governmental regulations affect almost every aspect of our business, including the fair treatment of our employees, wage and hour issues, and our financing activities with customers. We could also be susceptible to claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with applicable laws; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Federal and state governments in our markets have increasingly placed restrictions and limitations on the vehicles sold in the market in an effort to combat perceived negative environmental effects. For example, in the U.S., vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards which will increase substantially through 2025. Furthermore, numerous states, including California, have adopted or are considering requiring the sale of specified numbers of zero-emission vehicles. Significant increases in fuel economy requirements and new federal or state restrictions on emissions on vehicles and automobile fuels in the U.S. could adversely affect prices of and demand for the new vehicles that we rent; 
● | We are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including those governing: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of storage tanks; and the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. In the normal course of our operations we use, generate and dispose of materials covered by these laws and regulations. We face potentially significant costs relating to claims, penalties and remediation efforts in the event of non-compliance with existing and future laws and regulations; and 
● | The Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently evaluating several significant changes to generally accepted accounting standards in the U.S., including the rules governing the accounting for leases. Any such changes could significantly affect our reported financial position, earnings and cash flows. 

 
While we are actively working to mitigate the impact of vehicle-related regulations through our strategy of transitioning our vehicle fleet to all-electric, until such time as at least the majority of our fleet has switched, we will remain subject to such regulations.
 
Changes in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to taxes, automobile related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, automotive retail sales, cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.

Competition
 
We believe our principal competitors to be HyreCar, a publicly-traded company that also rents vehicles for use by drivers who work for Uber, Lyft, and food delivery platforms, and Lyft Express, which makes rental vehicles available to Lyft drivers. National car rental companies such as Hertz and Avis also have programs directed at ridesharing and delivery drivers.
