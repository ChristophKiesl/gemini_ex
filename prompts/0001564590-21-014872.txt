Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company currently focused on developing novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in viral and liver diseases. We utilize our proprietary oligonucleotide and small molecule platforms to develop pharmacologically optimized drug candidates for use in combination regimens designed to achieve improved treatment outcomes. Our lead effort is to develop a functional cure for Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB), which often results in other life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and the most common form of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The most widely used treatment for CHB, nucleos(t)ide analogs, suppresses viral replication but only achieves low rates of functional cure and often requires long-term administration. To address this issue, we have developed a portfolio of differentiated drug candidates for CHB, including an S-antigen Transport-inhibiting Oligonucleotide Polymers (STOPS) molecule, a small molecule Capsid Assembly Modulator (CAM), and oligonucleotides (ASO and siRNA), each of which is designed against clinically validated targets in the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) life cycle. We believe that combination regimens utilizing our portfolio of CHB drug candidates may lead to higher rates of functional cure. Phase 1 proof of concept trials evaluating the properties of our STOPS molecule and CAM are ongoing in New Zealand and each of such candidates has been approved to commence clinical trials in Hong Kong and Moldova. We may also in the future conduct clinical trials for our STOPS molecule and CAM and other drug candidates in other countries and territories, including South Korea, the United Kingdom, and China. Our second area of focus is in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a complex, chronic liver disease where combination regimens may likewise prove beneficial. Our most advanced drug candidate for NASH is ALG‑055009, a small molecule THR-ß agonist currently in nonclinical studies to enable a first-in-human clinical trial. We believe ALG‑055009 has the potential to become an integral component of future combination regimens for NASH. Our third area of focus is to develop drug candidates with pan-coronavirus activity, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19.
 Our team’s collective experience and success in discovering and developing drugs targeting viruses and liver diseases, combined with our in-house expertise in oligonucleotide and small molecule drug discovery, gives us a differentiated set of capabilities, which has enabled us to rapidly establish a robust pipeline of multiple novel drug candidates, as summarized in the pipeline chart below.
 

1

Our most advanced drug candidates are for the treatment of CHB, a disease that affects more than 290 million people worldwide with approximately 30 million people becoming newly infected every year, despite the availability of an efficacious prophylactic vaccine. Approximately 900,000 people worldwide died from complications of CHB in 2015, according to the World Health Organization, and CHB is the primary cause of liver cancer worldwide. Currently approved therapies for CHB include pegylated forms of interferon-alfa (peg-IFNα) and nucleos(t)ide analogs, which are designed to boost the body’s immune response to the virus or inhibit viral replication, respectively. While these therapies have improved treatment outcomes for some patients with CHB, they have not been able to achieve meaningful rates of functional cure, which is the consensus goal of treatment and defined as a sustained loss of HBsAg with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion. Functional cure has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of developing certain other more serious downstream liver conditions, such as cirrhosis and ESLD.
 Our clinical development strategy involves evaluating both Hepatitis B E-antigen (HBeAg) positive and HBeAg negative CHB patient populations. HBeAg is typically present in earlier stages of the disease and is associated with higher rates of viral replication. During the natural course of the disease, HBeAg can be cleared and antibodies develop, resulting in an HBeAg negative state where viral replication is often lower. Patients with HBeAg negative CHB are typically older and have more progressive disease-related complications (e.g., fibrosis of the liver). In addition, their immune system is likely to be more exhausted by chronic exposure to HBsAg, which makes viral clearance more difficult. Although we plan to ultimately study both populations, due to the greater availability of patients with HBeAg negative CHB at investigational sites, we intend to study this population first.
 

Multiple steps in the HBV life cycle, including those involving capsid assembly and production and secretion of HBsAg, are known to be essential to sustain HBV infection. We have built a portfolio of CHB drug candidates directed against clinically validated targets at several critical stages of the HBV life cycle. Our CHB portfolio includes:
  
• | STOPS are protein-binding oligonucleotides that share structural similarity with nucleic acid polymers (NAPs), which have been reported in clinical trials to significantly reduce circulating HBsAg and result in high rates of functional cure when used in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs and peg-IFNα. Our most advanced STOPS molecule is ALG-010133, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial, including in CHB patients. In nonclinical studies, ALG-010133 has demonstrated higher inhibitory activity than a reference NAP compound that is currently in clinical development.

• | CAMs are small molecule antiviral agents that accelerate HBV capsid assembly and inhibit pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) encapsidation, which reduces production of new virions capable of infecting other cells. CAMs may also inhibit the de novo establishment of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a major factor for the persistence of HBV infection, when introduced at the onset of infection. In clinical trials, other CAM drug candidates have demonstrated significant reductions in HBV DNA and pgRNA. However, it is likely that CAMs will need to be combined with other modalities that affect HBsAg in order to achieve functional cure. Our most advanced CAM drug candidate is ALG‑000184, a prodrug of ALG‑001075, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial, including in CHB patients. In nonclinical studies, we have shown that ALG‑001075 has significantly enhanced potency compared to other CAMs in clinical development of which we are aware
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ASOs are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that interfere with viral replication by binding to complementary messenger RNA (mRNA), allowing the combined ASO and mRNA to be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. Using our oligonucleotide discovery capabilities, we identified ALG-020572, an ASO that targets HBV mRNA and can reduce HBsAg production, which we plan to advance into clinical trials in the second half of 2021. In third-party clinical trials, ASOs targeting HBV mRNA have demonstrated significant reductions in HBsAg. Our ASO approach utilizes state of the art bioinformatics, proprietary stabilization chemistry and liver targeting technology that we believe provides a number of potential benefits compared to other ASO candidates of which we are aware, including increased potency, a higher barrier to resistance and broad genotype coverage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | siRNAs are a class of double-stranded, non-coding RNA that interfere with viral replication by silencing gene expression. Multiple siRNAs have demonstrated significant reductions in HBsAg levels in clinical trials. Our oligonucleotide discovery capabilities resulted in the identification of ALG‑125755, an siRNA drug candidate directed at HBV mRNA, which utilizes our proprietary liver targeting technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that a combination of drugs capable of inhibiting HBV DNA replication and RNA packaging (e.g., using CAMs) while simultaneously suppressing HBsAg production (e.g., using our STOPS molecule, ASO, and/or siRNA) has the potential to act additively or synergistically and may lead to a higher rate of functional cure. Our clinical development strategy is designed to evaluate safety and antiviral activity as monotherapy prior to evaluating multiple combinations of our CHB assets, with or without other currently available treatment modalities such as nucleos(t)ide analogs or peg-IFNα, to identify optimized combination regimens.
 Our second development effort is focused on the treatment of NASH. An estimated 1.5% to 6.5% of the global population, or up to about 450 million people, was believed to have NASH as of 2015 and this percentage is expected to increase significantly in the coming decade due to the adoption of Western dietary habits. In the absence of lifestyle modifications, the inflammation inherent in NASH persists and results in progressive fibrosis of the liver, which may lead to cirrhosis, ESLD, HCC, the need for liver transplant, and death. We believe one of the most promising pharmacologic approaches in development for NASH is a selective agonist of the beta subtype of the thyroid hormone receptor (THR-b), which, in clinical trials conducted by third parties, has demonstrated significant reduction in liver fat and inflammation, as well as the reduction in lipid levels in the serum, which may have important advantages in the NASH patient population that is at a high risk of cardiovascular co-morbidities. Utilizing our expertise in small molecule drug discovery, we identified ALG‑055009, a once-daily oral THR-b agonist. In nonclinical studies, ALG‑055009 has been shown to be substantially more potent compared to other THR-b agonists currently in development of which we are aware and may avoid some of their potential safety liabilities while having the potential to achieve equal or better efficacy. As a result, we believe ALG‑055009 has the potential to become an integral component of combination regimens to treat NASH. We intend to advance ALG‑055009 into clinical development in the second half of 2021.
 Our third area of focus is to develop pan-coronavirus treatment regimens. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been identified as a cause of more than ~2.4 million deaths worldwide as of February 2021. After MERS and SARS (SARS-CoV-1), SARS-CoV-2 is the third known coronavirus to have crossed over from animal species to humans in the past 20 years and cause significant morbidity and mortality. While multiple vaccines have recently become available, it is unlikely that vaccination will be fully efficacious and widely adopted, indicating that the need for effective therapeutic treatments will remain. Many of the drugs

currently being evaluated have not been optimized for the treatment of coronavirus infections or SARS-CoV-2, specifically. There is a need for purpose-built drugs which are suitable across a broad range of coronaviruses, patient populations and clinical settings, including prophylactic and post-exposure settings. We believe that, similar to CHB, a combination of antiviral and/or immunomodulatory drugs which target multiple points in the viral replication cycle offers the best chance of success. To address this urgent, unmet medical need, we are in early stages of development for multiple drug candidates including siRNA/ASO and protease inhibitors that are specifically designed to interact with targets that are highly conserved across multiple coronaviruses. Each of these drug candidates is intended to have pan-coronavirus activity and to be used in combination regimens to maximize their antiviral activity.
 Our management team consists of a group of highly collaborative, culturally diverse executives with decades of drug discovery and development experience and a proven track record of success in the areas of viral infections and liver diseases. Most members of our management team have worked together across multiple companies, many for over a decade, and have been collectively involved in the discovery and/or development of a number of drugs that have been successfully commercialized, including Ganovo, Olysio, Sovaldi, Hepsera, Infergen, Valtrex, Sirturo, Neupogen, Andexxa and Esbriet, among others. In support of our management team, we also have assembled an industry-leading board of directors and a world-class group of scientific advisors with significant experience in drug development for viral and liver diseases. Finally, we have top-tier investors, including Boxer Capital of Tavistock Group, Cormorant Asset Management, Janus Henderson Investors, Logos Capital, Novo Holdings, Pivotal bioVenture Partners, Roche Venture Fund, Versant Ventures, Vivo Capital and Wellington Management Company.
 Our strategy
 Our strategy is to develop pharmacologically optimized drug candidates for use in combination regimens designed to achieve improved treatment outcomes. Our initial areas of focus are viral and liver diseases where our team can leverage their in-depth knowledge and expertise to develop potentially best-in-class combination regimens addressing large areas of unmet medical need. The core elements of our business strategy include:
  
• | Developing improved drug candidates against clinically validated targets. We leverage our oligonucleotide and small molecule platforms to identify drug candidates with pharmacologically optimized characteristics compared to other drug candidates, including the potential for improved efficacy, safety and/or route of administration. By initially focusing on clinically validated targets, we increase the likelihood of demonstrating clinical efficacy and delivering optimized combination regimens. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Creating combination regimens to achieve better outcomes. We believe that most chronic and viral diseases require combination therapies for optimal treatment outcomes, and that combining individual drugs which can act additively or synergistically provides the greatest potential for enhanced efficacy. For each of our drug candidates, our strategy in Phase 1 is to rapidly evaluate safety and demonstrate proof of activity for each individual drug. Subsequently, we plan to combine multiple drug candidates in Phase 2 trials to identify optimized combination regimens to be advanced into pivotal trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing a functional cure for CHB. We have a portfolio of differentiated drug candidates for CHB, including a STOPS molecule, a small molecule CAM, and other oligonucleotides (ASO and siRNA) each of which is designed to inhibit clinically validated, distinct and critical points in the HBV life cycle. Our two lead drug candidates for CHB, ALG‑010133, a STOPS molecule, and ALG‑000184, a CAM, are currently in Phase 1 trials. Based on nonclinical studies, we believe that each of these drug candidates has demonstrated strong potential relative to other drugs in development. In combination, we expect our drug candidates to provide greater viral suppression, potentially leading to higher rates of functional cure. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding our development capabilities and pipeline. We are utilizing our in-house discovery expertise to continually improve upon our existing drug candidates by identifying promising backup candidates and exploring novel and emerging drug targets in viral and liver diseases. We are also evaluating novel mechanisms of action with the potential to complement our current pipeline. To further supplement our internal discovery and development efforts, we actively evaluate external technology platforms and assets for future development candidates for liver and viral diseases. To date, we have secured licenses for technology from Emory, Luxna and AM Chemicals, LLC (AM Chemicals), and have entered into collaborations with KU Leuven’s Rega Institute for Medical Research, as well as its Centre for Drug Design and Discovery, and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co.,

• | Maximizing the value of our drug candidates. We currently hold worldwide development and commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to all of our drug candidates. We intend to pursue independent development and commercialization in select indications and markets that we can address with a specialty sales and marketing organization. We may opportunistically explore additional licensing agreements, collaborations or partnerships to develop our drug candidates in larger market indications where we could accelerate development utilizing the resources of larger biopharmaceutical companies, or to commercialize them in specific geographies.

 Our approach to research and development
 Our oligonucleotide and small molecule platforms allow us to discover drug candidates that can be used to develop potentially best-in-class combination regimens. Oligonucleotide approaches enable specific inhibition of the translation of viral or host genes to affect a desired outcome that would be challenging to achieve with traditional small molecules. We believe the diversity of chemical matter we can generate with these complementary modalities broadens the range of therapeutic targets we can address with our platforms and provides us with a differentiated set of in-house capabilities to use in developing novel, optimized combination regimens across all of our current areas of focus.
 Our approach of combining multiple mechanisms from these distinct modalities is based on the observation that most chronic diseases, whether extrinsic (e.g., HIV and Hepatitis C) or intrinsic (e.g., metabolic syndrome conditions such as hypertension and diabetes), often require combination therapy to achieve optimal outcomes. Combination approaches have the advantage of simultaneously targeting multiple pathways and can act broadly and potentially synergistically. Particularly in the case of viral diseases, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs in combination can increase the barrier to viral resistance. As part of our drug candidate screening paradigm, we perform in vitro combination studies to ensure that none of the combinations we plan to evaluate clinically demonstrate antagonistic interactions.
 Our team has extensive end-to-end drug discovery and development experience across multiple therapeutic areas and disciplines. Our clinical development strategy leverages past experience to rapidly advance drug candidates towards optimized combination regimens. We have strengthened our platforms by in-licensing select intellectual property, which, together with our in-house expertise, allows us to develop novel and proprietary drug candidates.
 Oligonucleotide platform
 We have multiple distinct modalities within our oligonucleotide platform, including STOPS molecules, ASOs, and siRNAs. We have developed a portfolio of oligonucleotide drug candidates for the treatment of CHB, including: ALG‑010133, a STOPS molecule drug candidate; ALG‑020572, an ASO drug candidate; and ALG‑125755, an siRNA drug candidate. In addition, we are leveraging our oligonucleotide platform to develop drug candidates for coronaviruses and other diseases, which includes entering into a collaboration with Merck to discover and develop oligonucleotides against an undisclosed target for the treatment of NASH.
 We have exclusively licensed proprietary technologies that enhance our oligonucleotide platform. These technologies include third generation bridged nucleic acid (BNA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) chemistries, which can improve liver targeting, increase potency and enhance pharmacokinetic properties.
 S-antigen Transport-inhibiting Oligonucleotide Polymers (STOPS) molecules
 STOPS molecules are oligonucleotides which in vitro reduce the levels of key HBV viral markers, including HBsAg. They share structural similarity with NAPs such as IV-administered REP 2139 and REP 2165, which, when used in combination with nucleos(t)ides analogs and peg-IFNα in clinical trials conducted by others, have demonstrated significant declines in key HBV viral markers and increased functional cure rates over current standard of care. Our STOPS molecules, such as our lead drug candidate ALG‑010133, have been highly optimized and contain several novel chemical features, leading to enhanced in vitro potency and allowing for subcutaneous dosing.

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
 ASOs are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that interfere with viral replication by binding to and down-regulating mRNA expression, preventing subsequent protein translation. This technology has been validated across multiple indications, including CHB, where significant reductions in viral markers have been observed. We have discovered potent, liver-targeted ASOs, including ALG‑020572, which has demonstrated a promising profile in nonclinical CHB models.
 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
 siRNAs are a class of double-stranded RNA that interfere with viral replication by silencing gene expression and subsequent protein translation. siRNAs have shown efficacy across multiple indications, including CHB, where significant reductions in viral markers have been observed. Our novel and proprietary siRNA technology has resulted in the identification of molecules, including ALG‑125755, that have demonstrated high potency and long-lasting durability in nonclinical CHB models.
 Small molecule platform
 Our team has the capability and experience to rapidly identify and optimize small molecules, including traditional small molecules, peptidomimetics and prodrugs. Our team has a strong track record of developing and commercializing small molecule drug candidates. We use state-of-the-art computational chemistry and crystallography to enable structure-guided drug design. We have applied this approach to the multidimensional optimization of potential drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas, including for viral and liver diseases.
 Traditional small molecules
 To date, traditional small molecules represent the vast majority of approved drugs and are the primary chemistry approach used for drug discovery. CAMs are small molecules that have been shown to significantly reduce viral markers in CHB patients in clinical studies. Applying our small molecule platform, we have identified ALG‑001075, which has demonstrated improved in vitro potency and increased efficacy in nonclinical animal models, as compared to other CAM candidates that have advanced into the clinic. ALG‑001075 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study as the prodrug ALG‑000184. THR-b agonists are small molecules that have been shown to significantly reduce circulating lipid levels and improve liver histology in patients with NASH. We have discovered ALG‑055009, a THR-b agonist that has demonstrated improved potency in vitro and increased efficacy in nonclinical animal models relative to other THR-b agonists in Phase 2 or later stages of development.
 Peptidomimetics
 Peptidomimetics are small molecules derived from short polypeptides that can be used as drug candidates against multiple targets. The peptidomimetic approach has been successfully used in the antiviral field to develop protease inhibitor drugs against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Our team has discovered multiple potential nanomolar potency drug candidates targeting the 3C-Like protease of coronaviruses. These projects are moving towards the identification of a lead drug candidate with potentially broad spectrum activity against COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and possibly other emergent coronaviruses.
 Small molecule prodrugs
 A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized into the pharmacologically active parent drug. We use small molecule prodrug chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of drug candidates to improve their solubility and pharmacokinetics. We have successfully applied this approach to ALG‑001075 to create ALG‑000184, which is our lead CAM drug candidate, and which is currently being evaluated in the clinic for the treatment of CHB.
 We are engaged in multiple other small molecule discovery efforts to identify additional potentially best-in-class drug candidates for the treatment of CHB, NASH and coronaviruses.
 6

Our approach to developing potentially best-in-class therapeutic combinations
 Our approach to developing potentially best-in-class regimens for our therapeutic areas of interest leverages the most promising modalities from our oligonucleotide and small molecule platforms to advance rapidly from monotherapy Phase 1 trials into Phase 2 combination trials. As a first step, we evaluate the safety and activity of each drug candidate in healthy volunteers and patients with the disease of interest. We intend to then efficiently evaluate drug candidates shown to have activity in Phase 1 in various combinations in Phase 2 platform protocols to enable us to identify optimized combination regimens that will then be evaluated in Phase 3 pivotal trials. The combinations we evaluate may include additional drug candidates or current standard of care. Throughout all phases of clinical development, pre-specified adaptive study rules allow real-time adjustment of trial conduct based on emerging clinical trial data. These practices allow us to gain a rapid understanding of the risk/benefit profile for our individual drug candidates and combination regimens, and iteratively refine our strategy based on emerging data. This approach is summarized in the figure below.

Our pipeline
 We are focused on viral and liver diseases, areas in which our employees have expertise and decades of experience. Our most advanced drug candidates are designed for use in CHB to achieve higher rates of functional cure, which we believe will require the use of a combination of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action (MOA). Each of our CHB modalities plays an important role in disrupting the HBV life cycle and, in nonclinical studies, certain combinations have been shown to act additively or synergistically. We are also advancing a THR-ß agonist for NASH and purpose-built drug candidates for coronaviruses. We also have a collaboration with Merck to discover and develop oligonucleotides against an undisclosed target for the treatment of NASH. As with CHB, we believe combination therapy will be critical for improved patient outcomes in these disease settings and intend to combine our drug candidates with others that have potentially complementary MOAs.
 

Functional cure for CHB
 CHB is the most common viral infection in the world and an area of substantial unmet medical need. There were over 290 million chronic carriers worldwide as of July 2020 and approximately 30 million individuals become newly infected every year despite the availability of a prophylactic vaccine. In 2015, there were more than 90 million cases of CHB in China alone, while the EU, United States and Japan accounted for nearly 8 million cases. Complications from CHB include cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which collectively resulted in approximately 900,000 deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. CHB is the primary cause of liver cancer worldwide, and the mortality associated with HBV-related liver cancer continues to increase.
 8

Current therapy for CHB may entail life-long treatment and does not eliminate the virus in a meaningful number of patients. In the case of nucleos(t)ide analogs, long-term treatment can lower the amount of HBV DNA in circulation, resulting in improvements in long-term disease outcomes, but virological relapse is common after treatment cessation. Our goal is to achieve meaningful rates of functional cure, which is defined as a sustained loss of HBsAg with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion. Our team’s years of experience in antiviral drug development suggest that only by developing a combination regimen targeting multiple mechanisms can meaningful functional cure rates for CHB be achieved.
 

HBV is a small DNA virus consisting of a nucleocapsid in which the viral DNA is packaged together with the HBV polymerase by the hepatitis B core protein and a membranous envelope containing HBsAg. After infection of liver cells, HBV DNA is transformed in the nucleus into a stable viral mini-chromosome, which is composed of a cccDNA molecule, from which mRNAs encoding viral proteins are transcribed, and pgRNA, the template for the formation of new viral DNA genomes by reverse transcription. Parts of the viral genome can integrate into the host genome, which is thought to contribute to the production of HBsAg in chronically infected patients and play an important role in liver carcinogenesis, but the integrated viral genome does not produce infectious virus. HBsAg is known to prevent immune-mediated clearance of infected liver cells. HBsAg seroclearance correlates with significant decreases in cccDNA levels and implies immune control of HBV, indicating the need to reduce HBsAg to achieve functional cure.
 We have developed a portfolio of differentiated drug candidates for CHB, including a STOPS molecule, a small molecule CAM, and oligonucleotides (ASO and siRNA), each of which are designed to interfere with multiple clinically validated targets in the HBV life cycle and may lead to higher rates of functional cure when used in combination.
 ALG‑010133 (STOPS molecule) for CHB
 STOPS molecules share structural similarity with NAPs but contain several novel chemical features, providing enhanced potency in several HBV-infected cell lines. NAPs such as REP 2139 and REP 2165 have been reported to significantly reduce circulating HBsAg in patients with CHB when administered either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy, resulting in multiple log10 IU/mL reductions in HBsAg levels. The Replicor 401 study, a study of NAPs in combination with tenofovir and pegylated interferon, reported a 39% functional cure rate. A major drawback of NAP drug candidates is the requirement for weekly IV infusions given over two hours for 48 weeks. However, by exploring the chemistry around the STOPS structure, we have optimized STOPS molecules for activity, dose frequency and subcutaneous delivery, potentially negating the need for lengthy IV infusions. Use of our STOPS molecules given via subcutaneous injections and in combination with other convenient drug regimens may improve treatment adherence and functional cure rates. Enrollment in the Phase 1 proof of concept trial of our lead STOPS molecule, ALG‑010133, is currently ongoing and we anticipate safety and antiviral data from the initial cohort(s) in the second half of 2021 and study completion in the second half 2022.

ALG‑010133 is a synthetic oligonucleotide discovered by our team and that we are developing for the treatment of CHB. We originally optimized existing compounds to generate ALG‑010133 by using nucleotide stabilization chemistry. Varying the length of the STOPS molecule revealed a length dependency on antiviral activity; potency was maintained at lengths of more than 34 nucleotides, and dramatically reduced at lengths of less than 30 nucleotides. Nucleotide sequence variations in STOPS molecules also had effects on activity. In addition to length and sequence, backbone and sugar chemistry were modified; activity was improved with site-specific incorporation of backbone chemistries. Collectively, these structural elements provided a framework for STOPS molecule design and were important for the progression of ALG‑010133 into clinical development.
 As shown in the figure and table below, transfection of STOPS molecules into multiple HBV-infected cell lines, including primary human hepatocytes, resulted in the inhibition of HBsAg release into the supernatant in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, transfection of close analogs of ALG‑010133 were shown to decrease intracellular levels of HBsAg, indicating that this inhibition occurs inside the cell. This suggests that the inhibition of HBsAg release is not the result of only an inhibition of protein secretion, which would result in HBsAg accumulation within the cell, but instead could be the result of inhibition of synthesis and intracellular transport of HBsAg. The data below shows the comparison of ALG‑010133 to a NAP reference compound, ALG‑010004, which has an identical oligonucleotide sequence to REP 2139.
 



The HepG2.2.15 cell line is a commonly used in vitro HBV cell model. The cells contain two copies of the Genotype D HBV genome that produce infectious HBV and other subviral particles. The HepG2-NTCP (Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide) cell line over-expresses the NTCP receptor and has been shown to be a robust cell culture system supporting the complete life cycle of HBV. HepG2-NTCP cells were infected with a Genotype D HBV laboratory strain. In this cell line, HBsAg and other HBV viral proteins are produced from RNA transcripts derived from HBV cccDNA. ALG‑010133 and ALG‑010004 were evaluated in the HepG2.2.15 cell line to assess HBsAg release in the supernatant and cell viability.
 10

In addition, ALG‑010133 demonstrated potent activity in the inhibition of HBsAg release from a variety of infected cell types with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ≤22.5 nM when tested against cells infected with all major HBV genotypes (A, B, C, and D), indicating that ALG‑010133 may have pan-genotypic activity in CHB patients. Further, in patients with CHB, HBsAg can also be derived from an integrated HBV genome. The PLC/PRF/5 cell line, which contains an integrated partial HBV genome and produces HBsAg but not infectious virions, was used as a cell model of this condition. ALG‑010133 demonstrated activity in the inhibition of HBsAg secretion from the PLC/PRF/5 cell line with an EC50 of 23.7 nM with a 50% cellular cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of more than 1000 nM.
 To assess the capability for immune activation, ALG‑010133 was assayed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three independent donors for cytokine induction. The results of these experiments demonstrated that no direct immune activation is mediated by ALG‑010133. Nonclinical PK studies following subcutaneous dosing indicate long liver residence time that supports weekly or less frequent dosing for patients.
 Our ongoing three-part Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial comprises single and multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD) evaluations in healthy volunteers followed by a multiple dose evaluation in patients with HBeAg negative CHB. The first two parts of this study have been completed, with ALG‑010133 being administered subcutaneously once (SAD) or once weekly for three doses (MAD) in up to 104 healthy volunteers. In March 2021, we initiated the third part of this clinical trial, where we will be dosing once weekly for twelve doses in up to 60 patients with virologically suppressed HBeAg negative CHB.
 ALG‑000184 (CAM) for CHB
 CAMs are a class of small molecule antiviral agents that accelerate HBV capsid assembly and inhibit pgRNA encapsidation, resulting in lower circulating HBV pgRNA and DNA levels. CAMs are also believed to regulate formation and transcription of cccDNA at the onset of infection, a major factor for the persistence of HBV infection. In clinical trials, CAMs have been shown to provide greater HBV DNA and RNA reduction when combined with nucleos(t)ide analogs than can be achieved with the current standard of care, nucleos(t)ide analogs alone.
 In 2018, we in-licensed a lead drug candidate (GLP-26) and the associated IP for a CAM from the laboratory of Professor Raymond Schinazi at Emory. Our scientists optimized this lead drug candidate to discover the potent CAM ALG‑001075, which was further optimized to the prodrug ALG‑000184. ALG‑000184 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. We expect safety and antiviral data from the initial cohort(s) in the second half of 2021.

Molecular characteristics and nonclinical data
 In biochemical assays, ALG‑001075 was shown to induce the rapid assembly of core proteins into small, spherical capsids. Capsids assembled in the presence of ALG‑001075 were highly stable with a compound residence time of more than 16 hours. In assays using genotype D HBV infected HepG2.2.15 cells, ALG‑001075 demonstrated enhanced potency with an EC50 value of 0.53 nM compared to several CAM reference compounds. This finding was repeated in HepG2.117 cells where ALG-001075 had an EC50 value of 0.63 nM. This level of potency exceeds that of all other known CAMs that have entered clinical development.
 


ALG‑001075 was further tested in a transient HBV assay against a broad panel of HBV screens from genotypes A through J and was shown to maintain good activity against all genotypes tested except for certain genotypes with known CAM-resistant mutations.

In the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-HBV mouse efficacy model, ALG‑001075 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication with >5 log10 IU/mL reduction in HBV DNA at a dose of 15 mg/kg/dose given twice daily at 12-hour intervals (BID) as compared to a vehicle group.
 

We developed a highly soluble prodrug of ALG‑001075, ALG‑000184, to address the bioavailability limitations of ALG‑001075. ALG‑000184 has improved aqueous solubility, significantly better permeability and a reduced efflux ratio compared with ALG‑001075. Consequently, ALG‑000184 has significantly improved oral bioavailability compared to ALG‑001075. When administered in vivo, as shown in the figure below, ALG‑000184 was rapidly absorbed and efficiently converted to ALG‑001075 in nonclinical animal models.
 

Our three-part Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial comprises single and multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD) evaluations in healthy volunteers followed by a multiple dose evaluation in patients with CHB.
 In the healthy volunteer portion of the study, where enrollment was completed, ALG‑000184 was orally administered once (SAD) or once-daily for 7 days (MAD) in healthy volunteers. Screening in CHB patients for the 
 13

third part of the study is ongoing and, upon initiation of such third part of the study, we will dose once-daily for 28 days in up to 60 patients with CHB who are not currently receiving treatment. 
 ALG‑020572 (ASO) for HBV
 Anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that are complementary to a selected target sequence. ASO structures are typically composed of three sections, known as the wings and the gap. The wings are on each end of the oligonucleotide strand with the gap section bridging the wing sections. Wings are generally made up of BNAs, while the gap sections are typically made up of DNA or modified DNA nucleotides. ASOs interfere with viral replication by binding to complementary mRNA, a process known as hybridization. If binding occurs, this hybrid can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H resulting in significant down-regulation of mRNA expression, and, in the case of our CHB ASOs, preventing subsequent HBsAg translation and secretion. This process is shown in the figure below. ASOs have been validated across multiple indications, including CHB, where rapid and significant reductions in HBsAg have been observed.
 

We have exclusively licensed Luxna’s intellectual property for use of next-generation nucleotide monomers in our current focus areas, including CHB and SARS-CoV-2. This chemistry forms the basis of our ASO platform and has enabled us to design highly potent, stable ASOs that have an improved toxicology profile, including a reduction of hepatotoxicity, as compared to ASOs using earlier nucleotide monomer technology. The application of this technology, combined with our proprietary liver-targeting GalNAc conjugation, has led to our discovery of ALG‑020572, a potentially best-in-class HBV ASO targeting the open reading frame of HBsAg. We plan to begin a multipart Phase 1 study evaluating ALG‑020572 in healthy volunteers and patients with CHB in the second half of 2021.
 14

Molecular characteristics and nonclinical data
 We explored the structure activity relationship of BNA wing and nucleobase gap modifications across a set of diverse locked nucleic acid ASOs. When conjugated to our proprietary GalNAc moiety and administered subcutaneously (5 doses total, 10mg/kg given every 3 days over 12 days) to mice previously infected with an AAV‑HBV construct, ALG‑020572 demonstrated a 1.5 log10 IU/mL mean reduction in serum HBsAg. Vehicle-treated animals did not exhibit any significant changes in their serum HBsAg. Importantly, this intensive dosing regimen was not associated with any changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, a marker of liver cell damage.
 

We have discovered potent, liver-targeted ASOs, including ALG‑020572, which has demonstrated a promising profile in nonclinical CHB models. These ASO drug candidates may also be combined with other drug candidates against CHB.
 siRNA
 Small interfering RNA (siRNA), also known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA (RNAi), are a class of double-stranded, non-coding RNA, typically 20-27 base pairs in length. siRNA interferes with viral replication by silencing gene expression and subsequent protein (e.g., HBsAg) translation and secretion. siRNAs have shown efficacy across multiple indications, including CHB, where significant, gradual and durable reductions in HBsAg have been observed in clinical trials.

 15

siRNA-induced gene silencing is initiated with the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). One of the two siRNA strands, the guide strand or anti-sense strand, is loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand or sense strand, is degraded. Dicer enzymes are responsible for loading the guide strand into RISC. The cleavage of the mRNA molecule is thought to be catalyzed by the Argonaute proteins of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut by cleaving the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The process of siRNA-mediated RNA degradation is shown in the figure below.
 

We started with our bioinformatics approach to identify regions of the HBV genome for targeting and used our proprietary technology to maximize potency and minimize the number of 2’-F nucleotides in our sequences. We applied this approach to our screening paradigm to identify our lead siRNA candidate, ALG‑125755.
 16

Molecular characteristics and nonclinical data
 In cell-based assays measuring reduction in HBsAg in infected cells, our lead siRNA drug candidate, ALG‑125755, as well as additional backup compounds ALG‑125097 and ALG‑125819, demonstrated potent inhibition of HBsAg release from HBV-infected cells. When dosed in vivo in the AAV-HBV mouse model of CHB infection, a single 5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection resulted in a sustained reduction of serum HBsAg of approximately 1-1.5 log10 IU/mL through the last measurement at 28 days. The results from these experiments are shown in the figure below.
 

Currently, we are conducting additional studies using these siRNA drug candidates in the AAV-HBV mouse model to establish the effect of doses and dosing regimens on the extent and duration of HBsAg reduction. We plan to initiate toxicology studies with ALG‑125755 in the second half of 2021 to support first-in-human trials. 
 In conclusion, our proprietary siRNA technology is based on modifying chemistries and has resulted in the identification of drug candidates, including ALG‑125755, that have promising profiles with long lasting durability in nonclinical CHB models.
 Nonclinical combination data
 We performed in vitro studies in HepG2.2.15 cells to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions on HBsAg or HBV DNA reductions when combining our drug candidates, and the degree of synergy was quantified using MacSynergy II software. Combinations of our STOPS molecule, ALG‑010133, our CAM drug candidate, ALG‑001075, or our ASO drug candidate, ALG‑020572, with other inhibitors of HBV replication generally demonstrated either additive or synergistic interactions. We also studied in vivo combinations in the AAV‑HBV mouse model with ALG‑020572. These studies indicate that our drug candidates could become part of an effective combination regimen for CHB.

 17

Clinical development plan for CHB
 Our approach for developing a best-in-class CHB combination regimen is to discover and develop drug candidates initially targeting clinically validated MOAs, which are evaluated as monotherapy in Phase 1 and subsequently studied in Phase 2 and Phase 3 combination trials. This approach maximizes the chance of achieving higher rates of functional cure compared to current standard of care. Our CHB development strategy is depicted in the figure below.
 

Both our STOPS molecule (ALG‑010133) and our CAM molecule (ALG‑000184) Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing. 
 The figure below illustrates our planned general approach to Phase 1 trial design for each of our CHB drug candidates.
 

18

Although we expect the basic Phase 1 trial design to be the same across all of our CHB drug candidates, we anticipate there will be important differences, which include routes of administration, dose and dosing frequency, patient population, and key viral markers. A summary table of the key Phase 1 design elements and how we expect them to differ across our drug candidates can be found in the table below.
 

Drug candidates that show favorable risk/benefit profiles as monotherapy in Phase 1 will be evaluated in combination in our Phase 2 platform trials. This platform approach allows us to evaluate many combinations of our drug candidates along with approved drugs and/or other drug candidates in development, as needed. This strategy allows us to identify combination regimens that could achieve a higher rate of functional cure compared to current standard of care. The optimized regimen(s) identified in Phase 2 will then be evaluated in Phase 3 registrational trials.
 NASH
 One of the effects of improper diet and insufficient exercise is the accumulation of fatty deposits in the liver, referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which was estimated to occur in approximately 25% of the worldwide population as of 2015. At that time, an estimated 1.5% to 6.5% of the global population was estimated to have an ongoing inflammatory response to these excess fat deposits, which is referred to as NASH. Over the past several years, the prevalence of NASH has continued to rise. In the United States alone, the prevalence of NASH is projected to increase from approximately 16.5 million in 2015 to 27.0 million in 2030. In the absence of changes in diet and exercise, the inflammation inherent in NASH persists and may result in progressive fibrosis of the liver, which may result in cirrhosis. These fibrotic changes are associated with numerous morbidities including recurrent hospitalization for complications of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, need for liver transplant, and death.
 The only widely accepted treatment for NASH is weight loss through behavioral modifications such as diet and exercise, which is difficult to achieve at the broad population level. As there are currently no approved drugs to treat NASH, many development programs are underway to identify drugs to address this epidemic. One of the promising MOAs in the NASH space appears to be drugs which preferentially target the beta subtype of the THR receptor.
 THR-ß background
 The thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) has many physiological effects throughout the body, ranging from increasing metabolism, including fat metabolism, to stimulating growth and development. T3 exerts its effects by binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (THR), which has two subtypes: alpha (THR-α) and beta (THR-b). The distribution of the two THR subtypes varies by organ, with THR-b predominantly expressed in the liver and THR‑α predominantly expressed in other tissues (e.g., heart, skeletal muscles and bone). Drug candidates like resmetirom, which preferentially binds the THR-b subtype, have been shown in clinical trials to lower lipid levels in serum and the liver, while avoiding the unwanted effects associated with THR-α stimulation. In addition to the intended effect of lowering liver lipid levels in NASH patients, lowering serum lipid levels via THR-b agonism may have favorable consequences in this population, which has a high rate of underlying cardiovascular disease.
 19

There are multiple other mechanisms being explored for the treatment of NASH, but none have yet to demonstrate a favorable risk/benefit profile and many have important limitations. In some cases, mechanisms such as Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonists, Fibroblast Growth Factor-19 analogs, and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase inhibitors have been shown to increase serum lipid profiles, which may require additional pharmacologic therapy or put patients at additional risk of cardiovascular disease. In other cases, mechanisms such as FXR agonists and drugs targeting various subtypes of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors are associated with dose limiting toxicities such as pruritus and edema, respectively, that might limit widespread uptake even if approved. Other mechanisms in development, such as FGF19/FGF21 analogs, require subcutaneous administration, which may similarly limit widespread adoption even if approved.
 Small molecule approaches
 The most advanced THR-b agonists in clinical development are VK-2809 in Phase 2b and resmetirom in Phase 3. Both of these drugs have demonstrated significant reductions in lipid levels in the liver and serum and, to date, have an acceptable risk-benefit profile. In addition, resmetirom has demonstrated histologic evidence of NASH resolution in Phase 2 trials, which is one of two FDA approvable endpoints. Our lead THR-ß drug candidate ALG‑055009 may have important advantages over these compounds. Side-by-side biochemical and cell-based experiments in HEK293T cells indicate that ALG‑055009 is 5- to 47-fold more potent and 3- to 2-fold more selective for the b receptor compared to VK-2809 and resmetirom, respectively, which may optimize the risk‑benefit profile for ALG‑055009. When studied in a diet induced obesity (DIO) mouse model, these potency advantages were shown to result in greater serum lipid reductions compared to what has been previously reported for VK-2809 and resmetirom at exposures being evaluated in the clinic. Specifically, ALG‑055009 achieved a 34% reduction in serum total cholesterol levels with an acceptable safety profile (e.g., no clinically relevant changes in thyroid hormone levels) in mice, as shown in the figure below. An ALG‑055009 dose-related decrease in serum LDL-C was also noted in mice. Further, nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies of ALG‑055009 predict low, once-daily dosing in humans with a low risk of drug-drug interactions.
 

20


ALG‑055009 development plans
 Toxicology studies to support first-in-human trials are ongoing. In keeping with our general clinical development strategy, the first planned human trial of ALG‑055009 is expected to be a Phase 1a/1b umbrella study assessing orally administered single ascending doses in healthy volunteers followed by multiple ascending doses administered orally once-daily (QD) in subjects with mild hyperlipidemia. We expect this study to commence in the second half of 2021 (with data readouts expected to begin in the first half of 2022) and the study to be complete by the second half of 2022. The data from this study will establish proof of activity and help identify doses that may be evaluated in larger studies involving patients with NASH. With this proof of activity in hand, we would have several options for further development, including continuing the development of the drug candidate into a Phase 2 clinical trial that we would sponsor. Alternatively, we may explore partnering ALG‑055009 with a third-party that has an existing drug candidate for the treatment of NASH with a complementary MOA, either in a clinical collaboration or as an out-license opportunity. We believe this may be an ideal time to seek a partnership for ALG‑055009, as we expect enthusiasm for the THR-β MOA to be high after the expected Phase 3 resmetirom and Phase 2b VK-2809 readouts, which are expected in 2022.
 Oligonucleotide approaches
 Recently, genome-wide association and large candidate gene studies have enriched our understanding of the genetic basis of NASH. Variants in multiple human genome sequences have been identified as major common genetic determinants of this disease. We are collaborating with Merck to apply our oligonucleotide platform technology to discover, research, optimize and develop oligonucleotides directed against a NASH target. In addition, we continue to evaluate additional targets for their utility in developing an oligonucleotide based treatment for NASH. 
 Coronaviruses
 SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 108 million individuals and is responsible for the death of more than 2.4 million individuals worldwide. After MERS and SARS (SARS-CoV-1), SARS-CoV-2 is the third known coronavirus to cross over from animal species to humans and cause significant morbidity and mortality in the past 20 years. Due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the risk of additional novel coronaviruses emerging in the future, there is a need to develop novel therapeutics with pan-coronavirus activity that have a high barrier to resistance. While multiple vaccines have recently become available, it is unlikely that vaccination will be fully efficacious and widely adopted, indicating that a need for effective treatments will remain. The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants in various countries may also represent an additional challenge for current vaccines. 
 Many of the drugs currently being evaluated have not been optimized for the treatment of coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV-2 or have only shown efficacy in certain patient populations. Therefore, there is a need for new efficacious, purpose-built drugs which target a broad range of coronaviruses that would be suitable for use across a wide range of patient populations and clinical settings, including in pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment. We believe that a combination of antiviral drugs targeting multiple steps of the viral replication cycle poses the best chance of success. This approach maximizes the odds of covering a broad range of coronavirus strains and protecting against the emergence of resistance. To address this urgent unmet medical need, we are developing pan-coronavirus drug candidates including oligonucleotide and small molecule approaches that may be used in combination regimens.
 21

Disease overview and biology
 The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 is illustrated in the figure below. The spike (S) protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular receptor, leading to a fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is then released into the host cell and is subsequently translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral protease to form the RNA replicase–transcriptase complex. The polymerase produces a series of subgenomic mRNAs by transcription, which are eventually translated into relevant viral proteins. Viral proteins and genome RNA are subsequently assembled into virions in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi and then transported via vesicles and released out of the infected cells through exocytosis.
 

Therapeutic approaches to coronaviruses
 Therapeutic options for coronaviruses are currently limited and have significant drawbacks. Remdesivir, a drug originally advanced for HCV and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, but repurposed for Ebola and, now, SARS‑CoV-2, is currently limited to IV administration in hospitalized patients and has been commonly associated with a high risk of ALT elevation. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been shown to lower mortality in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, but has important safety liabilities, including immunosuppression, impaired wound healing and, rarely, anaphylaxis.
 22

We are leveraging our expertise in virology and utilizing both our oligonucleotide and small molecule platforms to develop purpose-built pan-coronavirus drug candidates targeting key steps of the viral life cycle, which we intend to evaluate in combination. Building on the success of HIV and HCV protease inhibitors, which are integral components of existing therapies, we are exploring small molecule peptidomimetics that inhibit the 3C-like protease (3CLPro). 3CLPro is the essential enzyme that is responsible for cleaving well-defined regions of the viral polyprotein and is highly conserved across major coronaviruses including MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS‑CoV-2. Drug candidates inhibiting the 3CLPro have the potential to be active against a wide range of coronavirus strains and become a foundational component of future combination regimens. We have identified multiple distinct proprietary lead series with potent nanomolar activity in a SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro protease assay and in multiple coronavirus cell-based assays. Our work in this area is being performed in collaboration with KU Leuven’s Rega Institute for Medical Research, as well as its Centre for Drug Design and Discovery.
 We are also leveraging our oligonucleotide platform to develop broadly active coronavirus drug candidates. Using our bioinformatics capabilities, we have identified over 350 highly conserved regions across coronavirus genomes. We are currently evaluating oligonucleotides with the goal of identifying a suitable lead sequence for further optimization into a drug candidate.
 Drawing on our small molecule and oligonucleotide approaches, we plan to develop a combination drug regimen that can serve in both treatment and prophylactic settings.
 Clinical development plan
 We plan to advance our coronavirus drug candidates individually in Phase 1 studies designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses in healthy volunteers. Following this, we plan to conduct dose range finding Phase 2 studies in subjects infected with COVID-19 to evaluate proof of activity and identify a dosing regimen(s) to advance into larger confirmatory studies that could support drug registration. Following the initial Phase 2 study, we may evaluate combinations of our drug candidates, with or without the then-prevailing standard of care. We intend to assess a range of patient populations, including community and hospital-based subjects, as well as various degrees of disease severity, following the establishment of proof of activity. In addition to evaluating our drug candidates as treatment options after infection, we may also evaluate them as potential prophylactic or post-exposure therapies.
 Early stage discovery efforts
 For all of our drug candidates, we are pursuing backup candidates in order to create a robust portfolio of assets which we can draw upon to create an optimized combination regimen for treatment in all of our disease areas of interest. We are also targeting additional novel viral and host targets with our oligonucleotide and small molecule platforms.
 Sales and marketing
 All of our assets are currently pre-commercial, and as such we have not yet established a sales and marketing organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to pursue independent development and commercialization in select indications and markets, and plan to build a commercial infrastructure to support a specialty sales and marketing organization, as well as distribution capabilities. Similar to our research, clinical and manufacturing operations, we expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through dedicated staff and third-party contractors and consultants. We may opportunistically explore licensing agreements, collaborations or partnerships with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities.
 Manufacturing
 We are currently developing drug candidates in two primary modalities: oligonucleotides and small molecules. We have internal oligonucleotide and small molecule chemistry teams that are able to produce drug candidates at sufficient scale to support discovery activities. In addition, we have a dedicated internal chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) team that works with contract development and manufacturing organizations to produce drug candidates in larger quantities, including to support nonclinical and clinical studies. We have built the teams and infrastructure needed to conduct and manage process development, analytical development, quality, manufacturing and supply chain activities.
 23

Oligonucleotides
 Oligonucleotide manufacturing technology has matured significantly over the last several decades, with advanced oligonucleotide synthesizers commercially available to support smaller-scale synthesis, and a network of oligonucleotide contract manufacturers available to support larger-scale syntheses. Our internal CMC team supports our contract manufacturers with process development and optimization, or, where needed, we may collaborate with external consultants and contractors to optimize synthesis and scale-up.
 Small molecules
 Small molecule manufacturing is a mature industry and is well supported by an extensive network of contract manufacturers. Like our approach for oligonucleotides, our internal CMC team conducts process development and optimization, and supports our contract manufacturers with technology transfer.
 Competition
 The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors may have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical drug candidates and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may develop superior drug candidates and may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for such candidates. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships.
 Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and/or new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their candidates more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our drug candidates or any future drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or that have a better safety profile than our drugs (if any) and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors, we may not be able to commercialize our drug candidates or any future drug candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. It is likely that our competitors, either working alone or in collaboration with others, will have significantly greater financial resources, an established presence in target markets, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical testing, and experience obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. We are also in competition for the limited qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, space at clinical trial sites, for patient registration for clinical trials and technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. New competitors may emerge, smaller or early-stage companies may grow, either on their own or through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies and competitors may concentrate through mergers and acquisitions.
 Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)
 Current FDA-approved treatments for chronic HBV infection include peg-IFNα, marketed by Roche Holding AG (Roche), and oral antiviral agents such as nucleoside analogs, marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. These treatments do not lead to either a functional or a complete cure in the vast majority of patients, and in the case of nucleoside analogs, may require life-long treatment. Several large and small pharmaceutical companies are developing programs with various mechanisms of action, to be used alone or in combination, with the goal of achieving higher rates of functional or complete cure in patients with CHB. Companies with oligonucleotide agents in clinical development include Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with Roche), Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with GlaxoSmithKline plc 
 24

(GSK)), Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen)), and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (together with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Several companies are developing CAMs, including Johnson & Johnson, Assembly Biosciences Inc., Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, Roche and Enanta Pharmaceuticals. Several companies, including Altimmune, Inc., GSK, Janssen and Transgene SA, are developing therapeutic vaccines for HBV, and several others have approved HBV vaccines, including Dynavax Technologies, Inc., GSK, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck. Replicor, Inc. is developing NAPs for use in CHB patients.
 Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
 There currently are no FDA-approved treatments for NASH. A number of pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC/MedImmune LLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Janssen, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together with Pfizer, Inc.), Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer Inc., Roche, Sanofi S.A. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (together with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC), as well as large and small biotechnology companies such as 89bio, Inc., Akero Therapeutics, Inc., Blade Therapeutics, Inc., Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., FronThera US Pharmaceuticals LLC, Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Genfit SA, Gilead, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Inventiva Pharma SA, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. (together with Novartis), Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Viking Therapeutics, Inc. are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target NASH. It is also probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of serious metabolic diseases, such as NASH, will increase.
Coronaviruses
 Other than Remdesivir, which is FDA-approved, there are currently no approved antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs are likely being used off-label for treatment, such as dexamethasone. Several approved drugs are being studied for their utility in reducing the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections, including Soliris by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Jakafi by Incyte Corporation, and Kevzara by Sanofi S.A./Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. There are significant efforts globally to develop both therapeutic and prophylactic drug candidates. Several companies are focused on antibody treatments, including Amgen Inc. (together with Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation), Abcellera Biologics, Inc. (together with Eli Lilly and Company), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (together with GSK, Biogen Inc. and WuXi Biologics Ltd.). Numerous efforts are underway to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including by Altimmune, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC (together with Oxford University), BioNTech SE (together with Pfizer Inc.), GSK (together with Sanofi S.A.), Heat Biologics, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Inc., Novavax, Inc., and Vaxart, Inc. The recent authorization of efficacious vaccines, if widely adopted, could reduce or eliminate the market for therapies to treat COVID-19.
 
License agreements and collaborations
 License agreement with Emory University
 In June 2018, we entered into the Emory License Agreement. In June 2020, we amended the Emory License Agreement (the Emory Amendment). Under the Emory License Agreement, Emory granted us a worldwide, sublicenseable license under certain of its intellectual property rights to make, have made, develop, use, offer to sell, sell, import and export products containing certain compounds relating to Emory’s hepatitis B virus capsid assembly modulator technology, for all therapeutic and prophylactic uses. Such license is initially exclusive with respect to specified licensed patents owned by Emory and non-exclusive with respect to certain of Emory’s specified know-how. Beginning in June 2022, the license to such patents will become non-exclusive with respect to all fields except for the treatment and prevention of HBV; however, we may select up to six compounds which will maintain exclusivity with respect to all therapeutic and prophylactic uses. With respect to all other compounds that are enabled by the licensed patents, those which are jointly invented by Aligos and Emory or inventors in the Schinazi laboratory, or which are disclosed in a specified licensed patent, are licensed to us exclusively including as to Emory, whereas all other such compounds are licensed to us non-exclusively. We have the right to sublicense rights licensed under the Emory License Agreement, provided that the sublicense agreement must be in compliance and consistent with the terms of the Emory License Agreement.
 25

Emory reserves the right for itself to practice, and have practiced by other entities solely for purposes of collaborative research with Emory, under the licensed patents for educational purposes, Emory’s internal purposes, and for non-commercial research, patient care and treatment. Emory can further grant licenses to not-for-profit and governmental institutions for their internal non-commercial research and scholarly use.
 Ownership of any new inventions arising out of our activities under the Emory License Agreement follows the inventorship laws of the United States. With respect to the licensed patents owned by Emory, we are required to prepare documents and filings for the prosecution and maintenance of such licensed patents, while Emory retains the option to provide final edits and approval of such documents and is responsible for the actual filing of such documents. We are responsible for the cost of the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents, and we have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce such patents. We are solely responsible for the costs of any lawsuits we elect to initiate to enforce the licensed patents and cannot enter into a settlement in respect of such lawsuits without the prior written consent of Emory. Any sums recovered in such lawsuits will be shared equally between us and Emory after reimbursement of our costs for such litigation, except that for any award based on lost profits, Emory shall recover the greater of fifty percent of the award or the royalty Emory would have received had the infringing sales been made by us.
 The technology claimed by the licensed patents under the Emory License Agreement may have been developed using U.S. government funding and the licenses therefore may be subject to a non-exclusive license held by the U.S. government, certain requirements that licensed products be manufactured substantially in the United States and U.S. government march-in rights. For more information on risks related to technology developed using government funding see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
 Under the terms of the Emory License Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring licensed products to market in accordance with a mutually agreed upon development plan.
 Pursuant to the Emory License Agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $290,000 to Emory, reimbursed Emory for past patent expenses, and issued a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $600,000 to Emory. In August 2018, the convertible promissory note was cancelled and converted into 64,980 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock. We paid Emory an additional $150,000 in connection with the Emory Amendment. Additionally, we agreed to pay Emory up to an aggregate of $125 million upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, and all ongoing patent costs. We also agreed to pay Emory tiered single-digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products, on a quarterly basis and calculated on a product-by-product basis. With respect to licensed products containing any of a specified subset of the licensed compounds, such royalties range from a mid-single digit to a high-single digit percentage rate. With respect to licensed products which do not contain such compounds, the royalties span a range of percentage rates within the mid-single digits if a Phase 1 clinical trial is initiated for the product within three years of the effective date of the Emory License Agreement, and range from a low-single digit to a mid-single digit rate if a Phase 1 clinical trial is initiated more than three years after the effective date. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of ten years after the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country and the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent right covering such product in such country. Lastly, if we sublicense any of the licensed patent rights, we are required to pay Emory a percentage of any license issuance or upfront fees we might receive, with the percent decreasing if we sublicense after the first anniversary and third anniversary of the effective date of the Emory License Agreement from a mid-double digit to a mid-single digit percentage rate. To date we have not granted any sublicense.
 The Emory License Agreement will expire upon expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed to us thereunder. We may terminate the Emory License Agreement at any time in its entirety or with respect to specific patents for convenience by providing Emory with 90 days’ written notice, and are required to terminate the Emory License Agreement if we make a final decision to cease research, development or commercialization of any licensed products. Either party may terminate the Emory License Agreement if the other party materially breaches such agreement and fails to timely cure such breach. Emory may terminate the Emory License Agreement if we fail to reach a milestone at an agreed date and fail to timely provide commercially reasonable evidence of a reasonable, good-faith business or technical justification for such failure. Upon termination of the Emory License Agreement for our material breach, we will, upon Emory’s request, grant to Emory a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to all of our rights in patents owned by, licensed or controlled by us to the extent they relate to our exercise of the licensed rights under the Emory License Agreement and include claims covering the manufacture, use or sale of any licensed products containing the licensed compounds. The Emory License Agreement will automatically terminate if we become bankrupt or insolvent or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent licensed to us under the Emory License Agreement.
 26

We have agreed to indemnify Emory and certain others under the Emory License Agreement for losses they may suffer arising out of the rights licensed thereunder or the manufacturing, testing, design, use, sale or labeling of any product containing a licensed compound, unless caused by such potential indemnitee’s negligence.
 License agreement with Luxna Biotech Co., Ltd.
 In December 2018, we entered into the Luxna Agreement. Under the Luxna Agreement, Luxna granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license under certain of Luxna’s intellectual property rights to research, develop, make, have made, and commercialize for all therapeutic and prophylactic uses, (i) products containing oligonucleotides targeting the hepatitis B virus genome, (ii) products containing certain oligonucleotides targeting up to three genes which contribute to NASH, which we may select at any time during the first eight years of the term, to the extent not licensed to a third party, and (iii) products containing oligonucleotides targeting up to three genes which contribute to HCC, which we may select at any time during the first three years of the term. During the first three years of the term, Luxna will not grant rights to any third parties under the licensed patents to research or develop any compounds or products targeting an HCC gene target. As of June 30, 2020, we have identified two HCC gene targets and two NASH gene targets for the exclusive license. In addition, we have a right of first refusal for any additional xeno-nucleic acid (XNA) and/or gapmer modifications that are not claimed by the licensed patents that Luxna controls. If we exercise this right, we and Luxna will use good faith, diligent efforts to negotiate additional commercially reasonable financial terms for such additional modifications. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the research, development and commercialization of the licensed products throughout the term. We have the right to sublicense our licensed rights provided that the sublicense agreement must be in compliance and consistent with the terms of the Luxna Agreement.
 Additionally, pursuant to an April 2020 amendment to the Luxna Agreement (the Luxna Amendment), we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license under the licensed patents to research, develop, make, have made, and commercialize products containing oligonucleotides targeting three families of viruses: orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, and coronaviridae (a family which includes SARS-CoV-2).
 Pursuant to the Luxna Agreement, we paid Luxna an upfront fee of $600,000 and pursuant to the Luxna Amendment, we paid Luxna an additional $200,000. Additionally, we agreed to pay Luxna up to an aggregate of $55.5 million upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. We also agreed to pay Luxna tiered royalties on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products, on a product-by-product basis, spanning a range of rates within low-single digit percentages, on a quarterly basis. With respect to each licensed product, our obligation to pay royalties will continue until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering such licensed product in any country.
 Luxna’s rights to the intellectual property subject to the Luxna Agreement stem from an exclusive license (the Luxna-Osaka Agreement) from Osaka University (Osaka) for certain rights pertaining to modifications of XNA and other gapmer technologies covered by the licensed patents. Separately, Osaka granted rights to certain third parties in connection with the licensed patents, such as rights to amido-bridged nucleic acid (AmNA) for specific indications including NASH, rights to manufacture reagents containing the modifications of AmNA and rights to use specified genes. Such rights are not included in the scope of rights granted to us under the Luxna Agreement and the Luxna Agreement does not prevent Osaka from using any of the licensed rights under the Luxna Agreement for its non-commercial research purposes relating to the modifications of XNA.
 Ownership of any new inventions arising out of our activities under the Luxna Agreement will follow the inventorship laws of the United States. Luxna retains the responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents, provided that Luxna consider our comments and suggestions in connection therewith. We retain step-in rights should Luxna decide to no longer prosecute or maintain any licensed patents under the Luxna Agreement. We have the first right, but not the obligation, at our sole expense to enforce the licensed patents. In connection with any infringement suit, neither party can enter into a settlement without the prior written consent of the other.
 27

The Luxna Agreement will expire upon expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed to us under the agreement. We may terminate the Luxna Agreement at any time for convenience by providing Luxna with 90 days’ written notice. In addition, we have agreed to terminate the Luxna Agreement if we make a final decision to cease research, development or commercialization of the licensed products. Either party may terminate the Luxna Agreement if the other party materially breaches the Luxna Agreement and fails to timely cure such breach. The Luxna Agreement will automatically terminate if we become bankrupt or insolvent.
 We have agreed to indemnify Luxna and certain others under the Luxna Agreement for losses they may suffer arising out of the rights licensed thereunder or the manufacturing, testing, design, use, sale or labeling of any product containing a licensed product, unless caused by such potential indemnitee’s negligence.
 License and Research Collaboration with Merck
 
In December 2020, we entered into an exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement with Merck under which Merck and Aligos will apply our oligonucleotide platform technology to discover, research, optimize and develop oligonucleotides directed against a NASH target and up to one additional liver-targeted cardiometabolic and/or fibroses target. Under the terms of the agreement, Aligos will receive an upfront payment from Merck as well as an additional payment after designation of a research plan for such an additional target. With respect to each collaboration target, Aligos will be eligible to receive up to $458 million in development and commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties on net sales. We will be primarily responsible for designing, preparing and evaluating the oligonucleotide molecules and delivering optimized lead molecules, and Merck will be responsible for subsequent research, clinical development and commercialization efforts. 
 Merck has the right to terminate the License and Research Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis at any time by giving us 90 days’ written notice. From the time Merck assumes responsibility for subsequent research until achievement of a certain regulatory event, we may terminate the License and Research Collaboration Agreement if Merck ceases all development activities for a specified period and fails to resume such activities within a reasonable time after we provide them with a resumption notice.  Either party may terminate the License and Research Collaboration Agreement upon the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency.  Upon termination for any reason other than our material breach, we will have the right to acquire from Merck the products and compounds being developed or commercialized by Merck under the License and Research Collaboration Agreement. Good faith negotiations between the Company and Merck would be performed to enact a transition plan. 
 Intellectual property
 One key to our success is our ability to establish and maintain protection for our drug candidates, platform technology and know-how, in order to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. To protect our drug candidates and technologies, we file U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and foreign patent applications related to our inventions, improvements, manufacturing and analytical processes and technology. We also rely on our know-how, confidential methodologies and processes and continuing technological innovation as well as our active third-party intellectual property in-licensing program to develop and maintain our proprietary positions, in addition to trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, advisors and consultants, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived of by the individual during the course of employment, and which relate to or are reasonably capable or being used in our current or planned business or research and development, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. However, such agreements and policies may 
 28

be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
 We have licensed patents and patent applications from various entities, including Emory, Luxna and AM Chemicals, which are further described below. As of December 31, 2020, we own 13 U.S. non-provisional patent applications, 35 U.S. provisional patent applications (excluding any non-expired U.S. provisional applications to which priority has already been claimed), 13 PCT applications and 14 foreign patent applications, including pending applications in Argentina and Taiwan.

With respect to both our licensed and our owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any current patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platforms and drug candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, the time required for development, testing and regulatory review of our candidate drug candidates may shorten the length of effective patent protection following commercialization. If we do obtain any patents for our drug candidates, the term of such patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time that the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic. In the future, if our drug candidates receive FDA approval and if our patent applications relating to such drug candidates issue as patents, we expect to apply for patent term extensions where applicable on patents covering those drugs. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our future issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether these extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of these extensions. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
 Trademarks
 Our trademark portfolio contains several trademark applications and registrations, including U.S. and foreign, as of December 31, 2020. The trademark portfolio includes the marks ALIGOS and STOPS. The mark STOPS is registered in Australia and the EU and is pending in the United States and Japan. The mark ALIGOS is registered in the United States, the EU and Japan.
 Government regulation and product approval
 Government regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local level, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. drug regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug can be marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA clinical holds, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 31

The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, where all supporting safety and toxicity studies are performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), representing each clinical site before a clinical trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility(ies) where the product is manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for its particular labeled uses in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nonclinical and clinical studies
 The nonclinical and clinical testing process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug or condition being treated.
 Nonclinical tests include laboratory (in vitro) evaluation of drug chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal (in vivo) studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug candidate. The conduct of nonclinical studies that provide safety and toxicological information must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of nonclinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about drug CMC and any available human data or literature to support use of the drug in humans. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin.
 For each successive clinical trial conducted with the investigational drug, a separate, new protocol submission to an existing IND must be made, along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan. Sponsors are also subject to ongoing reporting requirements, including submission of IND safety reports for any serious adverse experiences associated with use of the investigational drug or findings from nonclinical studies suggesting a significant risk for human subjects, as well as IND annual reports on the progress of the investigations conducted under the IND.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide 
 32

their informed consent for participation in each clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before a trial may be initiated at the site, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate tolerance and optimal dose, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted to obtain additional data prior to beginning Phase 3 trials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for drug approval. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional in vivo studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the drug candidate. Companies must also finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercially applicable quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and, among other things, must use validated methods for testing the drug against specifications to confirm its identity, strength, quality and purity. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development and testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the drug’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the drug for a specific use, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 33

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under applicable Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review NDAs for drugs containing new molecular entities within ten months of the 60-day filing date under standard review or within six months of the 60-day filing date under priority review.
 The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that relevant trial data was obtained in compliance with GCP requirements.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary, the drug sponsor must develop and submit a REMS as part of its NDA prior to approval. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, or other elements to assure safe use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, all REMS programs must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy following implementation.
 Further, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance as a condition of NDA approval to monitor the drug’s safety and efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the changes can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that supporting the original approval, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying drugs, one or more of which may be available for our current or future drug candidates.
 New drug candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the drug and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track drug candidate has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review 
 34

team during drug development and, once an NDA is submitted, the drug candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track drug candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 A drug candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A drug candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the drug candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 After an NDA is submitted for a drug candidate, including a drug candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the NDA may be eligible for priority review. An NDA is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. Depending on whether a drug candidate contains a new molecular entity, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take an action on the marketing application within six to eight months of the 60-day filing date, compared with ten to twelve months under standard review.
 Additionally, drug candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the drug candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the drug.
 Orphan drug designation
 We may pursue orphan drug designation for one or more of our current or future drug candidates, as appropriate, with the potential to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products, if approved.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a drug that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the drug with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee.
 35

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit an NDA for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP), within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of a Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The iPSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the iPSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon iPSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 A drug product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Post-approval requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a drug will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 After approval, most changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each drug identified in an approved NDA. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon manufacturers and their subcontractors, if applicable. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the drug reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of 
 36

distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing drug approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of drugs; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
 International regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to certain and could become subject to a variety of additional foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our drugs if we seek to market our drugs (if approved) in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional drug testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, drug recalls, seizure of drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, price reporting, and transparency laws and regulations regarding payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement fines, additional reporting requirements and oversight obligations, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
 In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly 
 37

challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drugs, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. For drugs administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the drug itself or the treatment for which the drug is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In Europe, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any drug candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 38

 
respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the TCJA was enacted, which included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the law.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives to control drug costs. 
 We anticipate that these new laws will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved drug, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs (if approved). In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 39

Data privacy and security
 We may also be subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy and security laws and regulations. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and regulations implemented thereunder, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties.
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
 In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. By way of example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provide consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations beginning July 1, 2020. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) recently passed in California, which will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data privacy agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial conditions. 
 We also are or will become subject to privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we sell or market our products or run clinical trials. For example, in the EU we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in relation to our collection, control, processing, and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to participants in our clinical trials in the European Economic Area (EEA), including the health and medical information of these participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each EU and EEA Member State, however, it provides that EU and EEA Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification 
 40

requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to EEA rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EEA. Recent legal developments in the EU have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (the Privacy Shield) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy, subject to certain conditions, of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism), future regulatory guidance could result in changes to the use of standard contractual clauses. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we operate and the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.
 We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we are subject to the GDPR, and we maintain an office in Belgium, which has its own set of stringent privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (UK GDPR), which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease / change our use of data, enforcement notices, or potential civil claims including class action type litigation.
 Employees and human capital resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 74 full-time employees, including 58 employees engaged in research and development. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
