--------+---------

 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I—“Risk Factors.”
 
Odyssey Group International, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation in March 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 4262 Blue Diamond Road, Suite 102-281, Las Vegas, Nevada 89139. The registration statement effectuating our initial public offering became effective in July 2015. We are an emerging growth company.
 
Our common stock is not listed or traded on any exchange or automated quotation system so there is currently no public market for our common stock. We are in the process of applying for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved.
 
As used herein, when we refer to “OGI,” the “company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean Odyssey Group International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
JOBS Act
 
Recently the United States Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), which provides for certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to public companies that are reporting companies and are “emerging growth companies.” We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 3(a) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012), and we will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC) or more; (b) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (c) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b–2. Therefore, we expect to continue to be an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future.
 
Generally, a registrant that registers any class of its securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is required to include in the second and all subsequent annual reports filed by it under the Exchange Act a management report on internal control over financial reporting and, subject to an exemption available to registrants that meet the definition of a “smaller reporting company” in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, an auditor attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from the requirement to include an auditor attestation report in our annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, even if we do not qualify as a “smaller reporting company”. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are able to avail ourselves to the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and not to present to our stockholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, obtain approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved or present the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and our financial performance. We have irrevocably elected to comply with new or revised accounting standards even though we are an emerging growth company.
 
General
 
Our Company is a trans-disciplinary product development enterprise involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of a broad range of products applied to our target industries. The Company has developed, and subsequent to July 31, 2014, began marketing a product called “Fit” to provide athletic enhancement products to improve the human body’s function during athletic stress. We currently own or control all proprietary rights in and to the formula called Fit as well as the respective rights, titles and interests in and to the formula. The formula is not patent protected, but is maintained solely as a trade secret. The Company has also acquired the right to sell and distribute a new technology called CardioMap®, which is an advanced technology for early non-invasive testing for heart disease. In November 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Insane Power LV, Inc. to create products for the retail sales channel for custom autos and ProjectALPHA, a well as auto upgrades with custom engine technology contributed by Insane Power LV, Inc. Subsequent to the year-end the Company entered into discussions to sell Company’s interest in this joint venture. The transaction sale of the Company’s interest in this joint venture is contemplated to occur in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and it is contemplated to be sold at cost.

Attached to these discussions of the sale of the Company’s interest in the joint venture, is the research and development expenses that the Company assumed for the joint venture earlier in the current fiscal year. Due to these subsequent events the research and development expense of $30,000 and its associated account payable for $30,000, which were accounted for in the previous quarters of the current fiscal year were reversed and attached directly to the joint venture for control and ownership of that research and development.
 
Our business model is to develop or acquire product formulas, engage third parties to manufacture such products and then distribute the products through various distribution channels, including third parties. We have paid a third-party to manufacture inventory of our product called Fit. We also intend to continue to focus on the sales of CardioMap®.
 
We intend to acquire other technologies and assets and plan to be a trans-disciplinary product development company involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of products and technologies that may be applied over various industries. We intend to provide our product, Fit, to improve the human body’s function during athletic stress and sell and distribute CardioMap®. We also intend to further identify and develop other products which may be used over various industries.
 
We intend to license, improve and/or develop our products and identify and select distribution channels. We intend to establish agreements with distributors to get products to market quickly as well as to undertake and engage in our own direct marketing efforts. We will determine the most effective method of distribution for each unique product that we include in our portfolio.
 
We intend to engage third party research and development firms who specialize in the creation of our products to assist us in the development of our own products from which we intend to obtain royalty payments of the future use of our products of third parties. We intend to apply for trademarks and patents once we have developed proprietary products.
 
Because there are many third-party manufacturers capable of manufacturing our current Fit product and we can quickly switch from one manufacturer to another, we do not expect to be dependent on any single third-party manufacturer. Currently, we have only authorized and may use two manufacturers to manufacture Fit.
 
We believe that purchasers select natural athletic enhancement products based primarily upon the performance of the products, name and brand recognition, endorsements or advertisements from recognized personalities and price.
 
Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
We do not report our revenues or expenses by segment. See financial statements audited by Piercy Bowler Taylor & Kern herein.
 
Suppliers, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 
Our Fit product is manufactured with a number of essential raw ingredients, including primarily avian egg extract, marine mineral complex, shark cartilage, Aloe vera and green tea. We do not purchase raw materials directly and do not utilize supply or forward purchase contracts to ensure the availability of the raw materials. We allow our manufacturer to determine the best sources of the raw materials, and we believe these raw materials are readily available from a number of sources, except that our marine mineral complex, AlgaeCal, which is a proprietary product of the sole supplier, AlgaeCal, Inc. If AlgaeCal was not available to us, there are alternative sources of comparable marine mineral complex. As to raw materials other than AlgaeCal, we face some risk that raw materials will not be available.
 
Our manufacturing contracts are stated as a fixed price. Our manufacturer may request price increases which we have agreed to negotiate in good faith.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
In addition to distributing domestically, we intend to enter into license agreements with qualified distributors in Europe, South America, and in the Philippines. We intend to require such licensees to pay to our company an initial license fee as well as royalties based on gross sales. Retaining exclusivity, we will bill based on a mutually agreeable semi-annual or quarterly sales minimum. We have determined to focus on international growth because generally such international license agreements provide a stronger path to revenue and earnings than purely domestic products.

Our objective is to grow revenue through marketing and sales of each of our current products, including Fit and with increased focus on CardioMap®. Although no assurances can be given, management anticipates company growth from the following areas:
 

1) | Distribution Agreements. In most cases, we will enter into distribution agreements with companies who already have sales professionals that already have experience selling health supplements through a variety of sales methods. These distribution agreements will allow us to more quickly achieve sales and revenue in the health products industries. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Generate revenues from sales of Fit and CardioMap® and through the development and distribution of new products. We intend to market Fit and CardioMap® through third party distributors and through our own efforts, and we intend to market any new products that may be developed or acquired. We also intend to use other marketing and sales methods we have not implemented. We intend to develop such opportunities if and as they present themselves as capital resources permit. 
3) | Identify and develop Fit and CardioMap® customers internationally and develop proprietary products. We intend to identify and find new Fit and CardioMap® customers by finding licensees with international opportunities. 

 
Through strategic licensing agreements, product acquisitions and expanding sales and margins in our Fit and CardioMap® inventory acquisitions, we may seek to achieve a larger geographic footprint and to create branding, greater economies of scale and improved marketing, advertising and sales programs.
 
About Fit 
 
Fit ingredients are a proprietary blend of “super foods.” Although there is no legal or medical definition of “super foods,” nutritionists generally agree that they are nutrient-rich foods considered to be especially beneficial for health and well-being because they contain concentrated doses of antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins or minerals. Fit contains a proprietary “Young Tissue Extract,” which contains, among other ingredients, extract from incubated fertilized hen eggs. We believe that these proteins fortify the body against degeneration and may raise the production of the youth hormone DHEA, possibly lowering cortisol levels. We believe that this blend may increase the recovery rate after physical exercise and sports participation.
 
Fit also contains EGCG, a super antioxidant that helps mediate oxidative stress, which we believe, may enhance metabolism, help balance glucose levels, increase fat oxidation and aid in weight management.
 
About CardioMap®
 
The CardioMap® System is an internet service based on the new development of Dispersion Mapping Method in ECG analysis for the early, non-invasive testing of a heart disease (CHD). The heart monitoring system provides high quality 3-D visualization and diagnosis of the heart using advanced signal analysis.
 
CardioMap® provides a better level of diagnosis with its improved sensitivity levels that can detect early warning signs that would normally be invisible with standard ECG devices. The system can dramatically cut the costs associated with the detection of ischemic heart disease and will prove to be an invaluable testing device for cardiologists, physicians, clinics, hospitals, the fitness industry, sports teams, emergency facilities and general public. CardioMap® was developed by VE Science Technology LLC, from whom we have purchased the product distribution rights.
 
Competition
 
We believe that the primary competition for our services is from existing distributors of products similar to our products. In our current market of the United States, we compete with other health and wellness companies. These companies are larger than we are in terms of revenues, assets and resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of cost.

We do not manufacture our products or packaging. For example, we use existing Fit that we purchased and that we will sell to our distributors who will sell to customers. In most cases, we view the manufacturers as suppliers of product and not as competitors. However, such manufacturers may sell their products directly to end users who intend to resell the products.
 
Many manufacturers have the infrastructure to manufacture our products but have not acquired the license or authorization to manufacture them. We currently hold all of the rights to make, use and sell the Fit formula and we have only appointed Faun Pharma as manufacturers. Manufacturers and distributors must obtain licensing and authorizations from our Company to distribute or manufacture Fit.
 
We believe that there are a few emerging distributors that offer products similar to our Fit product. However, we have not identified any such distributor that focuses primarily on our market of the United States.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Product Regulation
 
Domestic. The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products may be subject to certain regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the Federal Drug Administration (the “FDA”), Housing and Human Services (the “HHS”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”), the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold.
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under the FDC Act, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were “not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994”) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe.2 Supplements not meeting the criteria are “deemed adulterated” under 21 U.S.C. § 342(f). See 21 U.S.C. § 350b. Section 331 prohibits introducing, delivering, or receiving adulterated items. 21 U.S.C. § 331(a)–(d). The legal remedies include injunctive relief and seizures, among other penalties. 21 U.S.C. § 332–334. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient. In July 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although following FDA guidance is not mandatory, and companies are free to use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
 
FDA guidance is a strong indication of the FDA’s “current thinking” on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. At this time, it is difficult to determine whether the draft guidance, if finalized, would have a material impact on our operations. However, if the FDA were to enforce the applicable statutes and regulations in accordance with the draft guidance as written, such enforcement could result in monetary and jail penalties, injunctive relief, and seizures.3 In less severe sanctions, enforcement could also require us or our manufacturers to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, enjoining the manufacturing of our products by our third party manufacturers until the FDA determines that they are in compliance and can resume manufacturing, thus increasing our liability and reducing our growth prospects.
 
The Dietary Supplement Labeling Act of 2013, which was introduced in August 2013 (S. 1425), would amend the FDC Act to, among other things, (i) require dietary supplement manufacturers to register the dietary supplements that they manufacture with the FDA (and provide a list of the ingredients in and copies of the labels and labeling of the supplements), (ii) mandate the FDA and the Institute of Medicine to identify dietary ingredients that cause potentially serious adverse effects and (iii) require warning statements for dietary supplements containing potentially unsafe ingredients. If the bill is reintroduced and enacted,4 it could restrict the number of dietary supplements available for sale, increase our costs, liabilities and potential penalties associated with manufacturing and selling dietary supplements, and reduce our growth prospects.

The FDA or other agencies could take actions against products or product ingredients that in their determination present an unreasonable health risk to consumers that would make it illegal for us to sell such products. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer advisories or warning letters with respect to the products or ingredients in such products that are sold in our stores. Such actions or warnings could be based on information received through FDC Act-mandated reporting of serious adverse events.
 
As is common in our industry, we rely on our third-party vendors to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our vendors. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from the market, which in certain cases could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we would be able to offset all or any portion of losses related to any removal or recall.
 
The FDC Act, as amended by the DSHEA, permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-market approval. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function or well-being, among other facts, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. The manufacturer of the dietary supplement referenced in the labeled statement of nutritional support must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. Furthermore, the statement must prominently display the following boldface type statement: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim, conventional food claim or an unauthorized version of a “health claim,” or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we would be prevented from using the claim.
 
In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” e.g., a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. The literature: (1) must not be false or misleading; (2) may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement; (3) must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter; (4) if displayed in an establishment, must be physically separate from the dietary supplements; and (5) should not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products, and any dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug.
 
In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FDC Act as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplements. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers, holders, and distributors. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all manufacturers, and the FDA conducts inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. In addition, the FDA’s interpretation of the regulations will likely change over time as the agency becomes more familiar with the industry and the regulations. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated,” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), which was enacted in January 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements, which will likely increase the costs of dietary ingredients and will subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA also requires importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements.
 
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, require the reporting of serious adverse events, require a recall of illegal or unsafe products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the United States courts. The FSMA expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.

The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims.
 
As a result of our efforts to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we intend to, from time to time, as the regulations are updated reformulate, eliminate or relabel our products if necessary and revise certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
 
Foreign. Any products we eventually sell in foreign countries are also subject to regulation under various national, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. Government regulations in foreign countries may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of some of our products.
New Legislation or Regulation 
 
Legislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements. In June 2011, the FDA released draft guidance attempting to clarify when an ingredient is considered a new dietary ingredient, the evidence needed to document the safety of new dietary ingredients, and appropriate methods for establishing ingredient identity. The FDA’s guidance also attempted to clarify when products should be marketed as either dietary supplements or conventional foods formulated with added dietary ingredients.
 
We cannot determine what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional recordkeeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
 
Employees
 
At the date hereof, we have two employees and intend to hire additional employees in the foreseeable future.
