Overview
The Madison Square Garden Company is a leader in live experiences comprised of celebrated venues, legendary sports teams, exclusive entertainment productions, and other entertainment assets which include dining and nightlife venues and music festivals. Utilizing our powerful assets, brands and live event expertise, the Company delivers premium and unique experiences that set the standard for excellence and innovation while forging deep connections with diverse and passionate audiences. We manage our business through the following two operating segments: 
MSG Sports: This segment includes the Company’s professional sports franchises: the New York Knicks (the “Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (the “NBA”), the New York Rangers (the “Rangers”) of the National Hockey League (the “NHL”), the New York Liberty (the “Liberty”) of the Women’s National Basketball Association (the “WNBA”), the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (the “AHL”) and the Westchester Knicks of the NBA Gatorade League (the “NBAGL”). In addition, the MSG Sports segment is home to a broad array of other live sporting events, including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, tennis and college wrestling, all of which the Company promotes, produces and/or presents. In July 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Counter Logic Gaming (“CLG”), a premier North American esports organization, which is now part of our MSG Sports segment.
MSG Entertainment: This segment features the Company’s live entertainment events — including concerts, family shows, performing arts and special events — which we present or host in our diverse collection of venues. Those venues are: Madison Square Garden (“The Garden”), The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum, The Chicago Theatre and the Wang Theatre. Our MSG Entertainment segment also includes our original production — the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes (“Christmas Spectacular”) — as well as Boston Calling Events, LLC (“BCE”), the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. In January 2017, the Company purchased a controlling interest in TAO Group Holdings LLC (“TAO Group”), a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands, which is now part of our MSG Entertainment segment.

Our Strategy
The Madison Square Garden Company pursues opportunities that strengthen our portfolio of live experiences and capitalize on our iconic venues, popular sports franchises and exclusive entertainment content, as well as our expertise in venue management, bookings, marketing, sales and hospitality. We believe the Company’s unique assets and capabilities, coupled with our deep relationships in the sports and entertainment industries and our strong connection with our diverse and passionate audiences, are what set the Company apart. We continue to look for ways to improve our core operations, while we explore new opportunities to grow and innovate. Specific initiatives we are focused on include:

• | Developing championship caliber teams. The core goal of our sports strategy is to develop teams that consistently compete for championships in their leagues and support and drive revenue streams across the Company. We continue to explore new ways to increase engagement and revenue opportunities across the teams’ broad consumer and corporate customer bases.


• | Monetizing our exclusive sports content. The Company has media rights agreements with MSG Networks that provide a significant recurring and growing revenue stream to the Company, subject to the terms of such agreements. In addition, these agreements and our relationship with MSG Networks provide our fans with the ability to watch locally televised home and away games of the Knicks and Rangers, as well as other programming related to our teams, on MSG Networks’ award-winning regional sports networks.


• | Utilizing our integrated approach to marketing and sales. The Company possesses powerful sports and entertainment assets that can create significant value for our business when used in a complementary manner. For example:


◦ | Our integrated approach to marketing partnerships allows us to use and sell our broad array of assets together in order to maximize their collective value, both for the Company and for our marketing partners. Our ability to offer compelling, broad-based marketing platforms, which we believe are unparalleled in sports and entertainment, enables us to attract world-class partners, such as our “Marquee” marketing partner, JPMorgan Chase, and our “Signature” marketing partners — Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, Kia, Lexus, SAP and DraftKings.


◦ | We continue to forge deep direct-to-consumer relationships with customers and fans, with a focus on understanding how consumers interact with every aspect of the Company. A key component of this strategy is our large and growing proprietary customer database, which drives revenue and engagement across segments, benefiting the Company through ticket sales, merchandise sales and sponsorship activation. This database provides us with an opportunity to cross-promote our products and services, introducing customers to our wide range of assets and brands.


• | Utilizing a unique strategy for our performance venues. The Company has a collection of performance venues through which we deliver high-quality live sports and entertainment. In addition to our New York venues: The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre, our portfolio includes: the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre, and we have an exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. These venues, along with our venue management capabilities, effective bookings strategy and proven expertise in sponsorships, marketing, ticketing and hospitality, have positioned the Company as an industry leader in live entertainment. We intend to leverage our unique assets, expertise and approach to drive growth and stockholder value, and to ensure we continue to create unmatched experiences for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.


◦ | Maximizing the live entertainment experience for our customers. We use our first-class operations, coupled with new innovations and our ability to attract top talent, to deliver unforgettable experiences for our customers — whether they are first-time visitors, repeat customers, season ticket holders, or suite holders — ensuring they return to our venues. We have a track record of designing world-class facilities that exceed our customers’ expectations. This includes our renovations of Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, The Garden and the Forum, which now provide top-quality amenities such as state-of-the-art lighting, sound and staging, a full suite of hospitality offerings and enhanced premium products. In addition to better onsite

2

amenities, we continue to explore new ways to utilize technology to improve the customer experience and create communities around our live events. From the way our customers buy their food and beverage; to how we market and process their tickets; to the content we provide them to enhance their sports and entertainment experience, we want to give our customers the best in-venue experience in the industry.

◦ | Leveraging our live entertainment expertise to increase productivity across our performance venues. Part of what drives our success is our “artist first” approach. This includes our renovation of the Forum, which has set a new bar for the artist experience by delivering superior acoustics and an intimate feel, along with amenities such as nine star-caliber dressing rooms and dedicated areas for production and touring crews. This talent-friendly environment, coupled with more date availability and our top-tier service, is not only attracting artists to our West Coast venue, but bringing them back for repeat performances. We will continue to use our “artist first” approach to attract the industry’s top talent with the goal of increasing utilization across all of our venues through more multi-night and multi-market concerts and other events, including more recurring high-profile shows that help expand our base of events. Our residencies — Billy Joel at The Garden and Jerry Seinfeld at the Beacon Theatre — in which these legendary performers play each month is an example of this strategy.


◦ | Selectively expanding our performance venues in key music and entertainment markets. With the renovation of the Forum, we created the country’s only arena-sized venue dedicated to music and entertainment, which quickly established a strong presence in the market. We believe that, similar to Los Angeles, there are other select markets where our proven ability to develop music and entertainment-focused venues — coupled with our unique capabilities, expertise and “artist first” approach — will deliver a differentiated experience for artists, fans and partners. In May 2016, the Company announced plans to build a ground-breaking new venue in Las Vegas focused specifically on music and entertainment. We intend to continue to capitalize on this growth opportunity by identifying additional key markets where we can selectively expand our network of owned and operated venues, and pursue strategic partnerships with third parties to enhance and operate venues not owned by the Company. Controlling and booking an expanding network of world-class venues provides us with a number of avenues for growth, including driving increased bookings, greater marketing and sponsorship opportunities, and economies of scale.


• | Expanding our entertainment dining and nightlife venues. In January 2017, we purchased a controlling interest in TAO Group — one of the leaders in the hospitality and entertainment. TAO Group currently operates 24 entertainment dining and nightlife venues in New York City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Sydney, Australia with globally-recognized brands that include: TAO, Marquee, Lavo, Avenue, The Stanton Social, Beauty & Essex and Vandal. TAO Group is actively developing opportunities in select markets — both domestically and internationally — to expand its footprint of venues and food and beverage outlets.


• | Growing our portfolio of proprietary content. We will continue to explore the creation of proprietary content that enables us to benefit from being both content owner and venue operator. This includes opportunities to develop theatrical productions for our venues. We also see additional opportunity to use our venues as physical gathering places for communities that form and interact online and to expand our customers’ experience through the creation of venues that employ technology that brings people together both inside and outside our venues.


• | Exploring adjacencies that strengthen our business. As part of our commitment to creating unmatched experiences, we explore adjacencies that strengthen our position in sports and entertainment. Potential opportunities include new types of events and festivals, and new opportunities in hospitality, clubs, and food and beverage. In July 2016, the Company broadened its live experience offerings by purchasing a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company known for successfully creating and operating New England’s premier music festival — the Boston Calling Music Festival. This was followed in January 2017 by our purchase of a controlling interest in TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands.


• | Continuing to explore external strategic opportunities. We continue to seek strategic opportunities to add compelling assets and brands that resonate with our customers and partners, fit with our core competencies and allow new opportunities for growth across the Company. One of the ways we try to capitalize on our unique combination of dynamic assets, established industry relationships and deep customer connections is through strategic partnerships that bring together the expertise and capabilities of each partner, and enable us to team with recognized leaders in their fields and benefit from growth in those businesses. For example, we own 50% of Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC (“AMSGE”) which is backed by one of the music and entertainment industry’s most respected and influential executives, Irving Azoff. The joint venture owns and operates music, media and entertainment businesses, which allows us to pursue various businesses in the entertainment space. In addition, we own 50% of Tribeca Enterprises LLC (“Tribeca Enterprises”), bringing together two of New York’s cultural and entertainment icons to enhance the

reach and impact of both brands, while allowing us to partner with one of the most respected teams in the film and entertainment industry. 
Our Business
MSG Sports
Our Company is synonymous with some of the greatest sporting events in history. Today that tradition continues with our commitment to delivering a broad array of world-class sporting events that create lasting and indelible memories for sports fans. Our MSG Sports segment includes some of the world’s most recognized sports franchises, as well as a diverse selection of other live sporting events, that the Company promotes, produces and/or presents, primarily at The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden and the Forum.
Our Sports Franchises
The Knicks and Rangers are two of the most recognized franchises in professional sports, with storied histories and passionate, multi-generational fan bases. These teams are the primary occupants of The Garden, playing a combined total of 82 regular season home games, often to at or near capacity attendance. In addition, the Liberty currently play 17 regular season home games at The Garden each year. The number of home games increases if our teams qualify for the playoffs.
New York Knicks
As an original franchise of the NBA, the Knicks have a rich history that includes eight trips to the NBA Finals and two NBA Championships, as well as some of the greatest athletes to ever play the game. 2016-17 marked the 70th anniversary season for the team, which enjoys the fierce allegiance of generations of passionate and knowledgeable fans and is focused on fielding a championship-caliber team over the long-term. The Knicks ranked in the top three in the NBA for ticket sales receipts for the 2016-17 regular season.
New York Rangers
The Rangers hockey club is one of the “original six” franchises of the NHL with 2016-17 marking the team’s 90th anniversary season. Winners of four Stanley Cup Championships, the Rangers have won 11 conference titles over their history. For the 2016-17 season, the Rangers reached 102 points in the regular season, advancing to the playoffs for the seventh consecutive year and the 11th time in 12 seasons. The Rangers are known to have one of the most passionate, loyal and enthusiastic fan bases in all of sports and ranked in the top three in the NHL for ticket sales receipts for the 2016-17 regular season.
New York Liberty
The Liberty was established in October 1996, when New York was selected as one of eight charter members of the WNBA. Supported by an enthusiastic and loyal fan base, the Liberty have won three conference championships and appeared in the playoffs 14 times. In 2016, the Liberty finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference (21-13) for a second straight season and qualified for the WNBA playoffs as the number three overall seed.
Westchester Knicks
In March 2014, the Company acquired the right to own and operate an NBAGL team, which has been named the Westchester Knicks. The team plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY and serves as the exclusive NBAGL affiliate of the Knicks.
Hartford Wolf Pack
The Hartford Wolf Pack, a minor-league hockey team, is the player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Rangers send draft picks and other players to the Hartford Wolf Pack for skill development and injury rehabilitation, and can call up players for the Rangers roster to enhance the team’s competitiveness. The Hartford Wolf Pack have reached the playoffs 15 times in 20 seasons.
Esports
In July 2017, the Company took an important step forward with its plans to expand its portfolio of live experiences by purchasing a controlling interest in CLG, a premier North American esports organization, which is now part of our MSG Sports segment. Founded in 2010, CLG is one of the most established and successful organizations in the industry, operating eight teams across several well-known esports games: “League of Legends,” “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” “Super Smash Bros.,” and “H1Z1.” This acquisition followed the Company’s announcement in May that the New York Knicks plans to participate in the inaugural NBA 2K Esports League, set to debut in 2018.

The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations
As franchises in professional sports leagues, our teams are members of their respective leagues and, as such, may be subject to certain limitations, under certain circumstances, on the control and management of their affairs. The respective league constitutions, under which each league is operated, together with the collective bargaining agreements (each a “CBA”) each league has signed with its players’ association, contain numerous provisions that, as a practical matter in certain circumstances, could impact the manner in which we operate our businesses. In addition, under the respective league constitutions, the commissioner of each league, either acting alone or with the consent of a majority (or, in some cases, a supermajority) of the other teams in the league, may be empowered in certain circumstances to take certain actions felt to be in the best interests of the league, whether or not such actions would benefit our teams and whether or not we consent or object to those actions.
While the precise rights and obligations of member teams vary from league to league, the leagues have varying degrees of control exercisable under certain circumstances over the length and format of the playing season, including preseason and playoff schedules; the operating territories of the member teams; national and international media and other licensing rights; admission of new members and changes in ownership; franchise relocations; indebtedness affecting the franchises; and labor relations with the players’ associations, including collective bargaining, free agency, and rules applicable to player transactions, luxury taxes and revenue sharing. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Overview — MSG Sports — Expenses.” From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions the leagues take or the power and authority they assert, although the leagues’ governing documents and our agreements with the leagues purport to limit the manner in which we may challenge decisions and actions by a league commissioner or the league itself.
Other Sporting Events
The Company’s MSG Sports segment also includes a broad array of live sporting events that the Company promotes, produces and/or presents, including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, tennis and college wrestling. Many of these events are among the most popular in our history and are perennial highlights on our annual calendar, as well as some of The Garden’s longest-running associations.
Professional boxing, beginning with John L. Sullivan in 1882, has had a long history with The Garden. The Arena famously hosted Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier’s 1971 “Fight of the Century,” considered among the greatest sporting events in modern history, as well as numerous bouts featuring dozens of other boxing greats. These have included: Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Willie Pep, Emile Griffith, George Foreman, Roberto Duran, Oscar De La Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones, Jr., Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Miguel Cotto, Wladimir Klitschko and Gennady Golovkin, who in March 2017 successfully defended his championship titles against Daniel Jacobs in front of nearly 20,000 people at The Garden.
The Company has also expanded its presence in the fast-growing sport of mixed martial arts. In June 2016, the Forum hosted its first-ever Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) event with Michael Bisping capturing the middleweight title in an upset victory over Luke Rockhold. This was followed in November 2016 by The Garden hosting UFC 205, the first professional mixed martial arts event in New York state since 1995, during which Conor McGregor knocked out Eddie Alvarez and became the first UFC fighter ever to earn championships in two different divisions.
College sports have been a mainstay at The Garden for decades, with college basketball’s longest running holiday showcase, the Holiday Festival, first tipping off more than 60 years ago. In addition to St. John’s University calling The Garden its “home away from home,” the highly-anticipated Big East Tournament celebrated its 35th anniversary at The Garden in 2017. Popular college basketball events also include visits from Duke University’s Blue Devils, the annual Jimmy V Classic and the 2K Sports Classic. The Garden welcomed in March 2017 the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball East Regional Finals for the second time in four years and in 2018 will again host the Big Ten Men’s Basketball Tournament.
In 2007, The Garden sold out its first college hockey game — Red Hot Hockey featuring Cornell University versus Boston University — which has become a biennial event. College hockey has grown at The Garden over the last decade, with three hockey rivalry games held this past year, including one that was part of a Big Ten Conference basketball and hockey doubleheader, which will return in 2018.
Other world-class sporting events have included the NBA All-Star Game, which The Garden last hosted in 2015, marking the fifth time the arena has hosted the illustrious professional basketball event. Additionally, in May, The Garden welcomed the BNP Paribas Showdown tennis event for the ninth year, which has featured tennis luminaries such as Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. In August 2015, The Garden entered the world of esports as it welcomed the League of Legends Championship Series, a two-day event around the popular video game. League of Legends returned in October 2016 for its World Championships – which spent four nights at The Chicago Theatre for the tournament’s quarterfinals, before moving on to two sold-out nights at The Garden for the semifinals.

MSG Entertainment
Our Company delivers unforgettable entertainment experiences — including live events and spectacular productions — all in extraordinary settings that span some of the country’s largest entertainment markets. This creates a significant demand for an association with our brands — by artists, premier companies and the public. And with a foundation of iconic venues, our Company has a proven ability to leverage the strength of our industry relationships, marketing assets, customer database and live event expertise to create performance, promotion and distribution opportunities for artists, events and productions, and to increase utilization of our venues.
Specifically, our MSG Entertainment segment includes concerts, family shows, performing arts events and special events that we present or host at our venues, which are: The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum and The Chicago Theatre. In addition, we have an exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre. With seating capacities and configurations that range from 2,800 to 21,000, our collection of diverse venues enables us to showcase acts that cover a wide spectrum of genres and popular appeal.
Our MSG Entertainment segment also includes the beloved holiday show, the Christmas Spectacular — created for Radio City Music Hall and featuring the world-famous Rockettes. In February 2017, the Company announced the suspension of the 2017 planned presentation of its second large-scale production — the New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes (“New York Spectacular”). The Company is continuing its review of the show’s creative direction, timing and scale.
Over the past couple of years, the Company has been executing on its plans to build a robust, diversified portfolio of live experiences. In July 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. This was followed in January 2017 by the Company’s purchase of a controlling interest in TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands.
Our Live Entertainment Bookings
Our Company is an established industry leader that books a wide variety of live entertainment events in our venues, which perennially include some of the biggest names in music and entertainment. Over the last several years, our venues have been a key destination for artists such as the Eagles, U2, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Dead and Company, Madonna, Mumford & Sons, Phish, Fleetwood Mac, Adele, Eric Clapton, The Allman Brothers Band, Bruce Springsteen, Maroon 5, Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Katy Perry, Kanye West, Stevie Wonder, Sting and Peter Gabriel, Ariana Grande, Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle.
Our efforts to find new ways to increase the utilization of our venues led to a unique partnership between our Company and Billy Joel that made the renowned performer a staple of The Garden, playing monthly performances since January 2014. This extraordinary residency has been a great success with 42 sold-out performances through July 2017 and has cemented Billy Joel’s record for the most performances by any artist at “The World’s Most Famous Arena.” In December 2015, we added a second residency with the announcement that legendary New Yorker and comedian Jerry Seinfeld would appear monthly at the Beacon Theatre. Following 12 sold-out monthly shows in 2016, Jerry Seinfeld extended his residency through 2017, increasing his appearances to two performances one night each month. 
Our venues also attract family shows and theatrical productions, which this past year included: PAW Patrol Live, Sesame Street Live, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Cirque Du Soleil – Toruk. In addition, we frequently serve as the backdrop for special events such as the Tony Awards, “America’s Got Talent,” and the MTV Video Music Awards; appearances by luminaries such as His Holiness Pope Francis, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi; graduations, television upfronts, product launches and film premieres. 
Although we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows where we have economic risk relating to the event. MSG Entertainment currently does not promote or co-promote events outside of our venues.
Our Productions
One of the Company’s core properties, the Christmas Spectacular, has been performed at Radio City Music Hall for 84 years. The world-famous Rockettes, along with show-stopping performances, festive holiday scenes and state-of-the-art special effects, have played an important role in the critically-acclaimed show’s enduring popularity. During the 2016 holiday season, the Christmas Spectacular sold more than one million tickets. 
We acquired the rights to the Christmas Spectacular in 1997, and those rights are separate from, and do not depend on the continuation of, our lease of Radio City Music Hall. We also hold rights to the Rockettes brand in the same manner.
In 2015, we further extended the Rockettes brand with a new theatrical production built specifically for Radio City Music Hall. Previously called the New York Spring Spectacular, the show was renamed the New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City 
6

Rockettes and in 2016, moved to the summer months. The Company announced in February 2017 the suspension of the planned 2017 presentation of the New York Spectacular. The Company is continuing its review of the show’s creative direction, timing and scale.
We continue to strengthen and broaden our Rockettes brand, targeting the most prominent and effective vehicles that elevate their visibility and underscore their reputation as beloved American cultural icons. The Rockettes have appeared or performed at high-profile events, including Presidential Inaugurations, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Macy’s 4th of July Fireworks event, the New Year’s Eve Times Square Ball Drop, the Tony Awards, the Super Bowl XLV numeral unveil, television shows (“America’s Got Talent,” “Project Runway,” “The Today Show” and “The Colbert Report”), and fashion events (Michael Kors Fashion’s Night Out and Capezio Anniversary Gala), among many others. In May 2017, the Rockettes and the United Service Organizations (“USO”) re-energized a more than 70-year association between the two historic organizations as they announced that the Rockettes would participate in special appearances and performances across the country to honor, recognize and thank active troops, veterans and their families. We continue to pursue opportunities to generate greater brand awareness, including television and public appearances and dance education offerings.
Our Festival Offerings
In July 2016, the Company broadened its live experience offerings by acquiring a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company known for successfully creating and operating New England’s premier music and arts festival — the Boston Calling Music Festival. In 2017, the festival took place over Memorial Day weekend at the Harvard Athletic Complex, a new location for the festival that significantly expanded the festival’s capacity and content offerings. Tool, Mumford and Sons, and Chance the Rapper headlined the three-day event, which welcomed 45 music acts and featured a brand new comedy experience with 13 performances by standout comics. Other BCE events include the Boston Calling Block Parties, an annual series of outdoor events showcasing local music, and the Copenhagen Beer Celebration, a festival showcasing world-class brewers and musical acts held in Boston’s City Hall Plaza. 
Our Entertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings
In January 2017, the Company purchased a controlling interest in TAO Group, which strengthened the Company’s portfolio of live offerings with a complementary, hospitality group with widely-recognized brands that include: TAO, Marquee, Lavo, Avenue, The Stanton Social, Beauty & Essex and Vandal. Since 2000, TAO Group has been creating some of the most innovative premium experiences in the entertainment dining and hospitality industry. Today, TAO Group operates 24 venues – 11 venues in New York City, seven venues in Las Vegas, five venues in Los Angeles and one venue in Sydney, Australia – and is actively developing opportunities to expand on their success with new venues.
A majority of TAO Group’s venues are leased, while the rest are managed. Essentially all of the venues have either long-term leases or long-term management agreements with options to renew for multiple years.
Our Performance Venues
The Company operates a mix of iconic performance venues that continue to build on their historic prominence as destinations for unforgettable experiences and events. Individually, these venues are each premier showplaces, with a passionate and loyal following of fans, performers and events. Taken together, we believe they represent an outstanding collection of venues.
We own or operate under long-term leases a total of six venues in New York City, Chicago and Inglewood, CA and have an exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. Our New York City venues are the Madison Square Garden Complex (which includes both The Garden and The Theater at Madison Square Garden), Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre. Our portfolio of venues also includes the Forum in Inglewood, CA and the landmark The Chicago Theatre.
The Garden
The Garden has been a celebrated center of New York life since it first opened its doors in 1879. Over its 138-year history, there have been four Garden buildings, each known for showcasing the best of the era’s live sports and entertainment offerings. We believe that The Garden has come to epitomize the power and passion of live sports and entertainment to people around the world, with an appearance at The Garden often representing a pinnacle of an athlete’s or performer’s career. Known as “The World’s Most Famous Arena,” The Garden has been the site of some of the most memorable events in sports and entertainment, and, together with The Theater at Madison Square Garden, has hosted hundreds of events and millions of visitors this past year. In 2009, Billboard Magazine ranked The Garden the number one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Music industry subscribers of the trade magazine Pollstar have voted The Garden “Arena of the Year” 19 out of the last 24 years. The Garden is the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the nation and the second highest in the world based on Billboard Magazine’s 2017 mid-year rankings.

The Garden is home to the Knicks, Rangers and Liberty and is associated with countless “big events,” inspired performances and one-of-a-kind moments. Highlights include: “The Fight of the Century” between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971; the 1970 Knicks’ NBA Championship; the Rangers’ 1994 Stanley Cup Championship; three Democratic National Conventions and one Republican National Convention; Marilyn Monroe’s famous birthday serenade to President John F. Kennedy; Frank Sinatra’s “Main Event” concert in 1974; the only U.S. concerts from the reunited Cream; the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts and Billy Joel’s record-breaking 88 total performances at The Garden (through July 2017). In September 2015, His Holiness Pope Francis celebrated Mass at The Garden as part of his successful U.S. visit, which marked the first time a current pope has visited The Garden since Pope John Paul II in 1979. The Garden has also hosted four prominent benefit concerts, which galvanized the public to respond to national and global crises, including the first of its kind, “The Concert for Bangladesh” in 1972, as well as “The Concert for New York City,” following the events of 9/11; “From the Big Apple to the Big Easy,” held after Hurricane Katrina in 2005; and “12-12-12, The Concert for Sandy Relief” in 2012.
The current Madison Square Garden Complex, located between 31st and 33rd Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues on Manhattan’s West Side, opened on February 11, 1968 with a salute to the USO hosted by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. From a structural standpoint, the construction of the current Garden was considered an engineering wonder for its time, including its famous circular shape and unique, cable-supported ceiling, which contributes to its intimate feel. It was the first large structure built over an active railroad track. The builder, R.E. McKee, had a national reputation and was later recognized as a “Master Builder” by the construction industry. Architect Charles Luckman had one of the largest firms in the country and designed such buildings as the Prudential Tower in Boston, NASA’s flight center in Houston and the Forum in Inglewood, CA.
Following a three-year, top-to-bottom transformation, in October 2013, the Company debuted a fully-transformed Garden. Focused on the total fan experience, the transformation was designed to benefit everyone in attendance, whether first time visitors, season ticket subscribers, athletes, artists, suite holders or marketing partners. Our customers now have access to a full list of amenities including: improved sightlines; additional entertainment and dining options; new concourses; upgraded hospitality areas; new technology; unique historic exhibits; and a completely transformed interior, where the intimacy of the arena bowl and The Garden’s world famous ceiling have been maintained. The Garden’s transformation ensures that attending an event at “The World’s Most Famous Arena” is unlike anywhere else. 
We own the Madison Square Garden Complex, the platform on which it is built and development rights (including air rights) above our property. Madison Square Garden sits atop Pennsylvania Station, a major commuter hub in Manhattan, which is owned by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). While the development rights we own would permit us to expand in the future, any such use of development rights would require various approvals from the City of New York. The Garden seats up to approximately 21,000 spectators for sporting and entertainment events and, along with The Theater at Madison Square Garden, contains approximately 1,100,000 square feet of floor space over 11 levels.
The Theater at Madison Square Garden
The Theater at Madison Square Garden, which has approximately 5,600 seats, opened as part of the fourth Madison Square Garden Complex in 1968 with seven nights of performances by Judy Garland. Since then, some of the biggest names in live entertainment have played The Theater at Madison Square Garden, including The Who, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, Elton John, James Taylor, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Pentatonix, Sara Bareilles, Ellie Goulding, Ricky Gervais, Neil Young, Bill Maher, Radiohead, Jerry Seinfeld and Van Morrison. The Theater has also hosted boxing events and the NBA Draft; award shows such as The Daytime Emmys; and other special events including “Wheel of Fortune” and audition shows for “America’s Got Talent,” as well as a variety of theatrical productions and family shows, including A Christmas Story, Elf The Musical, and Sesame Street Live. The Theater at Madison Square Garden is the seventh highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2017 mid-year rankings.
Radio City Music Hall
Radio City Music Hall has a rich history as a national theatrical and cultural mecca since it was first built by theatrical impresario S.L. “Roxy” Rothafel in 1932. Known as “The Showplace of the Nation,” it was the first building in the Rockefeller Center complex and, at the time, the largest indoor theater in the world. Radio City Music Hall, a venue with approximately 6,000 seats, hosts concerts, family shows and special events, and is home to the Christmas Spectacular and the New York Spectacular. See “— MSG Entertainment — Our Productions.” Entertainers who have graced the Great Stage include: Yes, Lady Gaga, Jason Mraz, Bastille, Jack White, Kelly Clarkson, Leonard Cohen and Dave Chappelle. In 2009, Billboard Magazine ranked Radio City Music Hall the number one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Radio City Music Hall is the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2017 mid-year rankings.
In 1978, Radio City Music Hall was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. We acquired the lease in 1997, and in 1999, we invested in a complete restoration that returned the legendary theater to its original grandeur. Our acclaimed restoration touched all aspects 
8

of the venue and included burnishing the ceilings of Radio City Music Hall with 720,000 sheets of gold and aluminum leaf, replacing the existing stage curtain with a new 112-foot wide golden silk curtain, and cleaning the three-story tall mural “The Fountain of Youth,” by Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase. State-of-the-art sound systems, lighting and HDTV capabilities were also installed.
We lease Radio City Music Hall, located at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street in Manhattan, pursuant to a long-term lease agreement. The lease on Radio City Music Hall expires in 2023. We have the option to renew the lease for an additional 10 years by providing two years’ notice prior to the initial expiration date.
Beacon Theatre
In November 2006, we entered into a long-term lease agreement to operate the legendary Beacon Theatre, a venue with approximately 2,800 seats, which sits on the corner of Broadway and 74th Street in Manhattan. The Beacon Theatre was conceived of by S. L. “Roxy” Rothafel and is considered the “older sister” to Radio City Music Hall. Designed by Chicago architect Walter Ahlschlager, the Beacon Theatre opened in 1929 as a forum for vaudeville acts, musical productions, drama, opera, and movies. The Beacon Theatre was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Over its history, the Beacon Theatre has been a venerable rock and roll room for some of the greatest names in music including Steely Dan, Coldplay, Mariah Carey, Crosby Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne, Elton John, John Fogerty, Ray LaMontagne, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Eddie Vedder and Bob Dylan, as well as The Allman Brothers Band, which played their 238th show at the Beacon Theatre in October 2014, marking their final concert as a band. The venue has also hosted special events such as film premieres for the Tribeca Film Festival and comedy events, including our ongoing Jerry Seinfeld residency, along with numerous luminaries such as His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2009 and 2013, and President Bill Clinton in 2006 when the Rolling Stones played a private concert in honor of his 60th birthday. 
In August of 2008 we closed the Beacon Theatre for a seven-month restoration project to return the theater to its original 1929 grandeur. The restoration of the Beacon Theatre focused on all historic, interior public spaces of the building, backstage and back-of-house areas, and was based on extensive historic research, as well as detailed, onsite examination of original, decorative painting techniques that had been covered by decades-old layers of paint. The Beacon Theatre has won several architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The widely acclaimed, comprehensive restoration was similar to our restoration of Radio City Music Hall, and reflects our commitment to New York City. The Beacon Theatre is the ninth highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2017 mid-year rankings.
Our lease on the Beacon Theatre expires in 2026.
The Forum
In June 2012, we added a West Coast home with the purchase of the Forum in Inglewood, CA, which serves the Greater Los Angeles area. Following an extensive reinvention of the historic venue, on January 15, 2014, the Forum re-opened with the first of six concerts by the legendary Eagles and is once again a thriving destination for both artists and music fans. With both the Forum and The Garden, MSG now has an iconic arena in the country’s two largest entertainment markets.
The Forum is the only arena-sized venue in the country dedicated to music and entertainment, and offers something exceptional for everyone. Architecturally, the interior of the bowl has been completely modernized and features superior acoustics, along with flexible seating that ranges from 7,000 seats to 17,600 seats. Fans seated on the floor have access to one of the largest general admission floors in the country, with approximately 8,000 square feet of event level hospitality offerings. The Forum also offers exclusive spaces for VIP customers, including the historic Forum Club, and, for artists, delivers a first-class experience that includes nine, star-caliber dressing rooms with high-end amenities. Among the key features that were resurrected in an effort to replicate the original design is the exterior color of the venue, which was returned to the 1960’s “California sunset red,” and is now known as “Forum Red.” Other outdoor features include the addition of a distinct and iconic Forum marquee and a 40,000 square foot terrace that surrounds the perimeter of the building.
The original Forum was designed by renowned architect, Charles Luckman, who also designed The Garden that opened in 1968. The historic West Coast venue, which opened in 1967, has played host to some of the greatest musical performers of all time, including The Rolling Stones, The Jackson 5, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Madonna, Van Halen, Foo Fighters, Coldplay, Prince and many others. In addition, the Forum was home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until 1999.
Since re-opening in 2014, the Forum has received several architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The venue’s impressive lineup of entertainers has included: the Eagles, Justin Timberlake, Paul Simon and Sting, U2, Maroon 5, Drake, Kanye West, Stevie Wonder, Aerosmith, Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mumford & Sons, Foo Fighters, The Weeknd, Rihanna and Kings of Leon as well as His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The Forum has also hosted a number of special events such as the MTV Video Music Awards and Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards, as well as select sporting events, including Championship Boxing and mixed martial arts. The Forum is the sixth highest-grossing 
9

entertainment venue of its size in the nation, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2017 mid-year rankings.
The Chicago Theatre
In October 2007, to provide us with an anchor for content and distribution in a key market in the Midwest, we purchased the legendary Chicago Theatre, a venue with approximately 3,600 seats. The Chicago Theatre, which features its famous six-story-high “C-H-I-C-A-G-O” marquee, was built in 1921 and designed in the French Baroque style by architects Cornelius W. Rapp and George L. Rapp. It is the oldest surviving example of this architectural style in Chicago today, and was designated a Chicago landmark building in 1983 by the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council.
Today, The Chicago Theatre has become a highly attractive destination for concerts, comedy shows and other live events, hosting a wide range of entertainers, including Bob Dylan, Mumford & Sons, David Byrne, Neil Young, Steve Winwood, Jerry Seinfeld, Janet Jackson, The National, Louis C.K., Death Cab for Cutie, Conan O’Brien, Aziz Ansari and Steely Dan. The venue has also hosted theatrical tours such as A Christmas Story and Dr. Seuss’ How The Grinch Stole Christmas!. The Chicago Theatre is ranked the seventh highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2017 mid-year rankings.
Wang Theatre
Since August 2008, we have had a booking agreement with respect to the historic Wang Theatre in Boston. Under the booking agreement, we have been utilizing our diverse relationships and experience in event production and entertainment marketing to maximize the quantity and diversity of performances staged at the Wang Theatre. These performances have included theatrical productions and family shows such as the Tony award-winning Annie the Musical, Irving Berlin’s White Christmas the Musical, A Christmas Story, and Elf The Musical. The Wang Theatre has also welcomed a variety of concerts, including multi-night runs by Steely Dan, Sting, Neil Young, Eddie Izzard, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin and Furthur and performances from Jason Mraz, Leonard Cohen, Ringo Starr, Wilco, Tegan and Sara, John Legend and The Shins. The Wang Theatre seats approximately 3,600.
Our booking agreement expires in 2019. If we do not renew the agreement, it will not have a material negative effect on our business.
Our Interactive Initiatives
The Company has a collection of web sites, social networking sites and mobile applications for our sports and entertainment properties. Web sites include thegarden.com, theateratmsg.com, radiocity.com, beacontheatre.com, fabulousforum.com, thechicagotheatre.com and rockettes.com, as well as sites dedicated to our sports teams (nhl.com/rangers, nba.com/knicks, liberty.wnba.com, westchester.gleague.nba.com). Like our MSG Sports business, the online operations relating to our sports teams may, in certain circumstances, be subject to certain agreements, rules, policies, regulations and directives of the leagues in which the respective team operates. See “— Our Business — Regulation.” This interactive business generates revenue for the Company’s segments via the sale of advertising and sponsorships on these digital properties. Additionally, it offers strategic marketing assets that create opportunities to market directly to our fans and cross-promote our businesses.
Other Investments
We continue to explore additional opportunities that strengthen our existing position within the sports and entertainment landscape and/or allow us to exploit our assets and core competencies for growth.
In August 2013, the Company, in a partnership with the owners of Brooklyn Bowl, invested in building a venue in Las Vegas. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates” for further discussion.
In September 2013, the Company acquired a 50% interest in AMSGE. The AMSGE entity owns and operates businesses in the entertainment industry and is currently focused on music management, performance rights, comedy and productions, strategic marketing and venue management consulting services. This strategic partnership brings together the expertise and capabilities of each partner with the goal of jointly entering into attractive new businesses that generate revenue and cash flow. AMSGE currently has a 65% interest in Full Stop Management LLC., its core music management business, and an 85% interest in Global Music Rights, a performance rights company. In addition, AMSGE owns 50% interests in each Oak View Group, Levity Entertainment Group, Digital Brand Architects, Burns Entertainment and On Board Experiential Marketing. AMSGE will remain focused on capitalizing on investment opportunities within its existing businesses as well as on others in its pipeline, with the goal of accelerating its revenue growth.
In March 2014, the Company acquired a 50% interest in Tribeca Enterprises, the company that owns and operates the acclaimed Tribeca Film Festival, bringing together two of New York’s most important cultural and entertainment icons to enhance the reach and impact of both brands. Now in its 16th year, the annual Film Festival celebrates storytelling in a variety of forms – from film to television to virtual reality, music and gaming. The Festival supports emerging and established voices, discovers 
10

award-winning filmmakers, curates innovative and interactive experiences, and introduces new technology and ideas through panels, premieres, exhibitions, and live performance. Tribeca Enterprises’ businesses also include Tribeca Studios, a branded entertainment content business that has produced award-winning stories, and year-round live events. This joint venture augments our portfolio of premier New York City live entertainment brands, while also providing us with a high-profile entry into the festival business, with a team that has created one of the most successful festivals in the world. 
In July 2014, MSG Networks completed the sale of Fuse to SiTV Media, Inc., which has since been renamed Fuse Media, Inc., the parent company of NUVOtv. NUVOtv is an English language entertainment network created for modern Latinos. As part of the transaction, MSG Networks received a 15% equity interest in SiTV Media, LLC, which has since been renamed Fuse Media, LLC (“Fuse Media”), and such equity interest was transferred to the Company in connection with the Distribution. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates” for further discussion.
In August 2016, the Company acquired an approximately 12% common equity stake in Townsquare Media, Inc., a leading media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company that, like us, believes in the value of creating communities around shared experiences and compelling content. 
In addition to the investments discussed above, the Company also has other investments in various sports and entertainment companies and related technologies, primarily accounted for under the cost method of accounting.
Garden of Dreams Foundation
Our Company has a close association with The Garden of Dreams Foundation (the “Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity that is dedicated to making dreams come true for children facing obstacles. The Foundation works with 28 partner organizations throughout the tristate area, including hospitals, wish organizations and community-based organizations, to reach children who are facing challenges such as homelessness, extreme poverty, illness and foster care. Since it began in 2006, Garden of Dreams has used the magic of The Madison Square Garden Company — including the Rangers, Knicks, Liberty, Rockettes and famed showplaces — to brighten the lives of more than 325,000 children and their families. The Foundation takes pride in its commitment to truly change lives, hosting more than 500 events and programs each year. They include: events with the Knicks, Rangers and Liberty; special celebrations and event attendance at The Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre; visits by Madison Square Garden celebrities; The Garden of Dreams Talent Show, where children perform on the Great Stage at Radio City Music Hall; The Garden of Dreams Prom, which brings together teens who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend their own proms; toy drives; and the “Make A Dream Come True Program,” where children enjoy unforgettable experiences with celebrities and at events. In addition, through its Garden of Dreams Giving program, the Foundation helps its partner organizations meet the critical needs of the children they serve through direct support of scholarships and tangible, targeted community projects. To date, the Foundation has awarded scholarships to 41 children. Garden of Dreams has also served its partners by refurbishing pediatric wards at area hospitals, activity rooms and gymnasiums at community facilities and by creating brand new spaces such as music studios — with plans for many more vital civic enhancements in the years to come.
Regulation
Our sports and entertainment businesses are subject to legislation governing the sale and resale of tickets and consumer protection statutes generally.
In addition, our venues, like all public spaces, are subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments in the jurisdictions in which they are located. Our venues are also subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations, and, with respect to Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre, landmark regulations which restrict us from making certain modifications to our facilities as of right or from operating certain types of businesses. Our venues also require a number of licenses in order for us to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses and other authorizations and, with respect to The Garden, a zoning special permit granted by the New York City Planning Commission. In addition, our venues are subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires us to maintain certain accessibility features at each of our facilities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks — We Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Our Failure to Comply with These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
The professional sports leagues in which we operate, primarily the NBA and NHL, claim the right under certain circumstances to regulate important aspects of our sports business and our team-related online and mobile businesses. See “— Our Business — MSG Sports — The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations.”
Our sports and entertainment businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our Internet web sites and mobile applications. We maintain various web sites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our 
11

businesses, offer merchandise and tickets for sale and make available sweepstakes and/or contests. The operation of these web sites and applications may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, accessibility for persons with disabilities and consumer protection regulations. In addition, to the extent any of our web sites collect information from children under 13 years of age or are intended primarily for children under 12 years of age, we must comply with certain limits on commercial matter.
Competition
Competition in Our Sports Business
Our sports business operates in a market in which numerous sports and entertainment opportunities are available. In addition to the NBA, NHL, WNBA, AHL and NBAGL teams that we own and operate, the New York City metropolitan area is home to two Major League Baseball teams (the New York Yankees (the “Yankees”) and the New York Mets (the “Mets”)), two National Football League teams (the New York Giants (the “Giants”) and the New York Jets (the “Jets”)), two additional NHL teams (the New York Islanders (the “Islanders”) and the New Jersey Devils (the “Devils”)), a second NBA team (the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”) and two Major League Soccer franchises (the New York Red Bulls and the New York City Football Club). In addition, there are a number of other amateur and professional teams that compete in other sports, including at the collegiate and minor league levels. New York is also home to the U.S. Open tennis event each summer, as well as many other non-sports related entertainment options.
As a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the New York area sports fan. We must compete with these other sporting events in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at our games and the prices we charge for our tickets. In addition, for fans who prefer the unique experience of NHL hockey, we must compete with the Islanders and Devils as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NHL hockey teams and the NHL itself. Similarly, for those fans attracted to the equally unique experience of NBA basketball, we must compete with the Nets as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NBA teams and the NBA itself. In addition, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and live entertainment events for advertising and sponsorship dollars.
The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our professional sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenues derive from rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our teams and our ability to attract other compelling sports content.
In July 2017, we acquired a controlling interest in CLG, a premier North American esports organization. Due to the nature of esports, CLG competes with other teams across North America and globally. CLG competes for sponsorship, merchandise rights, media rights, and event prize winnings. Esports teams vary in their amount of funding, size of existing business, and amount of social following, among other factors, which can impact our ability to compete effectively.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Sports Business — Our Sports Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Competition in Our Entertainment Business
Our entertainment business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, with other live performances, sporting events, movies, home entertainment (including the Internet and online services, television, video and gaming devices), restaurants and nightlife venues, and the large number of other entertainment and public attraction options available to members of the public. Our businesses typically represent alternative uses for the public’s entertainment dollars. The primary geographic area in which we operate, New York City, is among the most competitive entertainment markets in the world, with the world’s largest live theater industry and extensive performing arts venues, 12 major professional sports teams, thousands of restaurants and nightlife venues, numerous museums, galleries and other attractions, and numerous movie theaters available to the public. Our venues and live offerings outside of New York City similarly compete with other entertainment, dining and nightlife options in their respective markets and elsewhere. We compete with these other entertainment options on the basis of the quality of our productions, the public’s interest in our content, the price of our tickets, the quality, location and atmosphere, including the nature and condition of the setting, of our venues, our service, the price, quality and presentation of our food and the overall experience we provide.
12

We compete for bookings with a large number of other venues both in the cities in which our venues are located and in alternative locations capable of booking the same productions and events. Generally, we compete for bookings on the basis of the size, quality, expense and nature of the venue required for the booking.
In addition to competition for ticket sales and bookings, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and sporting events for advertising and sponsorship dollars.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Entertainment Business — Our Entertainment Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations” and “ — Negative Publicity with Respect to Any of the Existing or Future TAO Group Brands Could Reduce Sales at One or More of the Existing or Future TAO Group Venues and Make the TAO Group Brands Less Valuable, Which Could Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Employees
As of June 30, 2017 we had approximately 4,800 full-time union and non-union employees and 8,200 part-time union and non-union employees. Approximately 50% of our employees were represented by unions as of June 30, 2017. Approximately 34% of such union employees are subject to CBAs that expired as of June 30, 2017 and approximately 23% are subject to CBAs that will expire by June 30, 2018 if they are not extended prior thereto. Labor relations in general and in the sports and entertainment industry in particular can be volatile, though our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. We have from time to time faced labor action or had to make contingency plans because of threatened or potential labor actions.
The NHL players and the NBA players are covered by CBAs between the NHL Players’ Association (“NHLPA”) and the NHL and between the National Basketball Players Association (“NBPA”) and the NBA, respectively. Both the NHL and the NBA have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues in the future. On June 30, 2011 the prior CBA between the NBA and NBPA expired and there was a work stoppage for approximately five months until a new CBA was entered into in December 2011. On September 15, 2012 the prior CBA between the NHL and NHLPA expired and there was a work stoppage for approximately four months until a new CBA was entered into in January 2013. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks — Organized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
Substantially all of the Company’s revenues and assets are attributed to or located in the United States and are primarily concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. Financial information by business segments for each of the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 is set forth in “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements — Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements — Note 16 Segment Information.”
