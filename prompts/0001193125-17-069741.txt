Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for prostate cancer and other hormonally driven diseases. We have focused substantially all of our research and development efforts on the development of galeterone, an oral small molecule, including clinical trials of galeterone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. We also have a drug discovery program, known as ARDA (androgen receptor degradation agents), under which we identified novel compounds for patients with androgen receptor signaling diseases, including prostate cancer. 
 In July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue ARMOR3-SV, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial comparing galeterone to Xtandi ® (enzalutamide) in treatment-naïve mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant, following the recommendation made by the trials independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, in July 2016. Based on a review of all available safety and efficacy data, the DMC determined that the ARMOR3-SV trial would likely not succeed in meeting its primary endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival for galeterone versus enzalutamide in men with AR-V7 positive mCRPC. In making its recommendation, the DMC did not cite any safety concerns with galeterone in the trial. We conducted a review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients in the future. All patients enrolled in the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial have discontinued treatment. 
 In addition, in August 2016, we determined to discontinue enrollment in our Phase 2 ARMOR2 expansion clinical trial of galeterone in mCRPC patients with acquired resistance to Xtandi and not to proceed with our planned study of galeterone in mCRPC patients who rapidly progress on either enzalutamide or Zytiga ® (abiraterone acetate). Ten patients in the ARMOR2 trial continue treatment as of January 31, 2017. 
 Following the announcement regarding the discontinuation of the ARMOR3-SV trial, in July 2016 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to reduce the size of our workforce by approximately 60% to a total of 10 full-time equivalent employees. The workforce reduction, which was completed in September 2016, was designed to reduce our operating expenses while we conducted a review of development options for galeterone and the ARDA program. As of January 31, 2017, we had eight full-time employees. 
 In September 2016, we announced that our board of directors had initiated a review of strategic alternatives that could result in changes to our business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, which was conducted in parallel with a review of development options for galeterone and the ARDA program, our board determined to review alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, including potentially a sale of the company, a reverse merger, a business combination or a sale, license or other disposition of company assets. 
 On December 21, 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or Share Purchase Agreement, with Otic Pharma, Ltd., a private limited company organized under the laws of the State of Israel, or Otic, and the shareholders of Otic named therein, or the Selling Shareholders, pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, each Selling Shareholder agreed to sell to us, and we agreed to purchase from each Selling Shareholder, all of the ordinary and preferred shares of Otic, the Otic Shares, owned by such Selling Shareholder. We refer to our acquisition of all the outstanding equity of Otic as the Otic Transaction. We amended and restated the Share Purchase Agreement on March 2, 2017 to update the allocation of shares of our common stock among the Selling Shareholders and to extend to May 31, 2017, the date after which we or Otic may terminate the Share Purchase Agreement. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Share Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the Otic Transaction, the Selling Shareholders will collectively receive up to 36,911,631 shares of our common stock, assuming that all 
 
2 
 
 of Otics outstanding options and warrants are exercised prior to closing. Immediately following the closing of the Otic Transaction, the Selling Shareholders are expected to own approximately 60% of our outstanding common stock (62% if all of Otics outstanding options and warrants are exercised prior to closing). 
 We, Otic and the Selling Shareholders have agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Share Purchase Agreement including, among others, covenants relating to (1) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of our stockholders to the Tokai Voting Proposal described below, (2) non-solicitation of competing acquisition proposals by each of us and Otic, (3) our use of commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the existing listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., or NASDAQ, (4) ours and Otics conduct of ours and its respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Share Purchase Agreement and the closing of the Otic Transaction and (5) restrictions on our ability to make any capital expenditures or other expenditures, other than those contemplated by our financial model provided to Otic on the date of the Share Purchase Agreement. 
 Consummation of the Otic Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, (1) approval by the our stockholders in accordance with applicable NASDAQ rules of the issuance of the shares of our common stock in the Otic Transaction, which we refer to as the Tokai Voting Proposal, (2) the absence of any order or injunction preventing the consummation of the Otic Transaction or any legal requirement that makes the consummation of the Otic Transaction illegal, (3) the approval by NASDAQ of the NASDAQ Listing ApplicationFor Companies Conducting a Business Combination that Results in a Change of Control with respect to the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Otic Transaction and (4) obtaining certain governmental authorizations or consents, including certain Israeli tax rulings. Each partys obligation to consummate the Otic Transaction is also subject to other specified customary conditions, including (1) the representations and warranties of the other party being true and correct as of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement and as of the closing date of the Otic Transaction, generally subject to an overall material adverse effect qualification, and (2) the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Share Purchase Agreement. The Share Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Otic, and further provides that, upon termination of the Share Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Otic a termination fee of $1 million, or Otic may be required to pay us a termination fee of $1.5 million. 
 Under the Share Purchase Agreement, we agreed that promptly following the closing of the Otic Transaction, we would take all action necessary to fix the number of members of our board of directors at seven; to cause to be elected to our board of directors four persons identified by Otic, who are each reasonably acceptable to the Company; and to cause (i) the resignations of three members of our board of directors or (ii) the resignations of four members of our board of directors, and the election of one person identified by us, who is reasonably acceptable to Otic. In addition, we have agreed to take all action necessary to cause the persons identified by Otic to be appointed as executive officers of Tokai. 
 Upon consummation of the Otic Transaction, we will change our name to OticPharma, Inc. In addition, we intend to seek stockholder approval to effect a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio that we will determine, which is intended to ensure that the listing requirements of NASDAQ are satisfied. 
 Also in connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, our directors and certain entities affiliated with Apple Tree Partners holding in the aggregate approximately 36.3% of our outstanding common stock as of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement have each entered into a support agreement in favor of Otic, or the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement places certain restrictions on the transfer of the shares of our common stock held by the respective signatories thereto and covenants on the voting of such shares in favor of approving the Tokai Voting Proposal and against any actions that could adversely affect the consummation of the Otic Transaction. 
 In addition, we have entered into a commitment letter with Otic and certain purchasers set forth therein under which the purchasers have agreed to invest up to $7.0 million of new capital in Otic and/or Tokai prior to 
 
3 
 
 or upon the closing of the Otic Transaction. Pursuant to the commitment letter, on January 31, 2017 we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the purchasers under the commitment letter under which such purchasers agreed to purchase 3,603,601 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.11 per share. The purchase and sale of our common stock pursuant to this stock purchase agreement will occur at the time of the closing of the Otic Transaction. The remaining $3.0 million will be invested in Otic prior to the closing of the Otic Transaction through the exercise of outstanding warrants. 
 The Treatment of Prostate Cancer 
 Prostate Cancer Overview 
 According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States, prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men other than skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that, in the United States, approximately 215,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed annually, and approximately 28,000 men will die from the disease each year. 
 Prostate cancer is most frequently diagnosed at an early stage, when it is confined to the prostate gland and its immediate surroundings. Patients with early-stage disease are typically treated with surgery or radiation therapy, or in limited circumstances, with both. For the majority of men, these procedures are successful in curing the disease. However, for others, these procedures are not curative and their prostate cancer ultimately recurs. Men with recurrent prostate cancer are considered to have advanced prostate cancer. In addition, about 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Men with metastatic disease are also considered to have advanced prostate cancer. 
 Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer 
 The growth and survival of prostate cancer tumor cells depend primarily on the functioning of the androgen receptor signaling pathway. The pathway is ordinarily activated by the binding of androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, to the ligand binding domain of androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells. Once binding has occurred, the bound androgen/androgen receptor complex passes into the nucleus of the tumor cell where it binds to DNA in the cancer cell, triggering abnormal cell growth and tumor progression. 
 Because testosterone fuels prostate cancer growth, first-line therapy for advanced prostate cancer typically entails androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, or LHRH, analogs such as the drug Lupron® (leuprolide). ADT reduces testosterone to levels that are commensurate with the levels of a male who has had surgical castration to minimize the testosterone that would otherwise fuel prostate cancer growth. 
 Most advanced prostate cancer patients initially respond to ADT. However, after initiation of ADT, almost all advanced prostate cancer patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth despite the reduction of testosterone to castrate levels. These patients are considered to be castration resistant, and cancer that has reached this state is considered to be castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. 
 During the course of ADT or following diagnosis of CRPC, most patients are treated with anti-androgens, which block the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. An example of an anti-androgen marketed in the United States is the drug Casodex® (bicalutamide). Like LHRH analogs, the anti-androgens suppress tumor growth for a period of time in many CRPC patients. However, almost all CRPC patients develop resistance to anti-androgen therapy. 
 Prior to 2010, the next line of treatment for patients who became resistant to treatment with LHRH analogs and anti-androgens was chemotherapy and there were no effective FDA-approved treatments for CRPC patients following chemotherapy. Since 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA has approved five new 
 
4 
 
 agents for the treatment of patients with CRPC. Of these new agents, the two with the highest worldwide sales in 2016 were Zytiga and Xtandi. Zytiga and Xtandi are members of a class of new oral drugs that act by disrupting the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Zytiga disrupts the androgen receptor signaling pathway by inhibiting CYP17 and reducing production of testosterone in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer tumor cells. Xtandi is an androgen receptor antagonist that disrupts the androgen receptor signaling pathway by blocking the binding of testosterone or the androgen DHT with the androgen receptor. We refer to Zytiga and Xtandi as second-generation androgen signaling inhibitors. 
 Despite the new therapies, including Zytiga and Xtandi and additional drug candidates in late-stage clinical development, we believe that there continues to be an unmet need as there are patient populations that may not be effectively addressed by these therapies, such as mCRPC patients with C-terminal loss. 
 Unmet Need in Prostate Cancer Patients with C-Terminal Loss 
 The growth and survival of prostate cancer tumor cells depend primarily on the functioning of the androgen receptor signaling pathway. The pathway and tumor cell growth is ordinarily activated by the binding of androgens, such as testosterone and DHT, to the ligand binding domain of androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells. All proteins, including androgen receptors, are made up of a chain of amino acids that has an N-terminus at one end of the chain and a C-terminus at the other end of the chain as shown in the full-length androgen receptor depicted in Figure 1 below. In the case of androgen receptors, the C-terminus contains the ligand binding domain. The effectiveness of therapies like Zytiga and Xtandi, which act solely through CYP17 inhibition or androgen receptor antagonism, requires a functional ligand binding domain. As depicted in Figure 1 below, in the case of prostate tumor cells that express truncated androgen receptors with C-terminal loss, there is no functional ligand binding domain. This lack of a functional ligand binding domain causes the truncated androgen receptor to be constitutively active, or continuously signaling, meaning that activation of the androgen receptor pathway and tumor growth occurs even in the absence of androgens and androgen binding. As a result, we believe that patients with truncated androgen receptors with C-terminal loss may not be effectively treated by these therapies. 
 Figure 1: Full-Length Androgen Receptor and Androgen Receptor with C-Terminal Loss 
 


These limitations of CYP17 inhibitors and androgen receptor antagonists have been supported by investigator-initiated studies conducted at several leading academic medical centers in which the presence of C-terminal loss or AR-V7 in patients was associated with poor responsiveness of patients prostate tumors to Zytiga and Xtandi. Published data, however, have shown activity of docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent, in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients. 
 Galeterone 
 Overview 
 Our lead product candidate, galeterone, is an oral small molecule that utilizes the mechanistic pathways of current second-generation androgen signaling inhibitors, while also introducing a distinct mechanismandrogen receptor degradation. We are developing galeterone for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. 
 
5 
 
In June 2015, we initiated ARMOR3-SV, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial comparing galeterone to Xtandi in approximately 148 treatment-naive mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant. We believe that the AR-V7 splice variant is the most common form of C-terminal loss, or the loss of the portion of the androgen receptor that contains the ligand-binding domain. C-terminal loss generally, and AR-V7 specifically, has been clinically associated with poor responsiveness to commonly-used oral therapies for mCRPC. 
 On July 25, 2016, the independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, for the ARMOR3-SV trial met to review safety and efficacy data from the trial. Based on a review of all available safety and efficacy data, the DMC determined that the ARMOR3-SV trial would likely not succeed in meeting its primary endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival for galeterone versus enzalutamide in men with AR-V7 positive mCRPC and recommended that enrollment in the trial be ceased. In making its recommendation, the DMC did not cite any safety concerns with galeterone in the trial. In July 2016, we announced our plan to discontinue the ARMOR3-SV trial. In addition, in August 2016, we determined to discontinue enrollment in our Phase 2 ARMOR2 expansion clinical trial of galeterone in mCRPC patients with acquired resistance to Xtandi and not to proceed with our planned study of galeterone in mCRPC patients who rapidly progress on either enzalutamide or Zytiga. Enrollment in the ARMOR3-SV and ARMOR2 trials has now been closed, with only ten patients in the ARMOR2 trial continuing treatment as of January 31, 2017. 
 We conducted a review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients in the future. Moreover, if the Otic Transaction is consummated, we do not expect Otic to proceed with the development of galeterone. However, we have agreed with Otic that Otic will continue the treatment of the continuing patients in the ARMOR2 trial. 
 Galeterone Clinical Development 
 We referred to our clinical development program for galeterone as the Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response, or ARMOR, program. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA for galeterone for the treatment of CRPC in August 2009 and began clinical trials of galeterone in November 2009. Prior to suspending our ARMOR3-SV Phase 3 clinical trial, we had enrolled 213 CRPC patients and 102 healthy volunteers in our ARMOR program. 
 ARMOR2 
 In December 2012, we initiated our ARMOR2 trial, an open label Phase 2 clinical trial of galeterone. The trial was designed as a two-part trial. Part 1 of the trial was a dose escalation phase designed to confirm the dose of galeterone to be evaluated in Part 2 of the trial. Part 2 of the trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of galeterone at the dose selected in Part 1 in distinct CRPC patient populations. The primary efficacy endpoints of our ARMOR2 trial were based on a decrease in PSA levels. In August 2016, we determined to discontinue enrollment in this clinical trial. As of January 2017, 10 patients were still receiving treatment in the trial. 
 Part 1 of ARMOR2 Trial. In Part 1 of the trial, we enrolled 25 CRPC treatment-naïve patients with progressive disease and three patients whose disease progressed during treatment with Zytiga, whom we refer to as Zytiga-refractory patients. The CRPC treatment-naïve patients were enrolled in one of three escalating dose cohorts: six patients at 1700 mg/day, 11 patients at 2550 mg/day and eight patients at 3400 mg/day. The Zytiga-refractory patients all received doses of 2550 mg/day. All patients in Part 1 of the trial received treatment for up to an initial period of 12 weeks followed by optional continued dosing for those patients who tolerated treatment and did not show signs of disease progression. Treatment was continued until disease progression or patient withdrawal due to adverse events or other reasons. 
 
6 
 
At least 50% of patients at all dose levels achieved a 30% or greater decrease in PSA. Based on the recommendation of the monitoring committee for the trial following review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic results of the three dose groups, we chose the 2550 mg/day dose for further study in Part 2 of the ARMOR2 trial. 
 Part 2 of ARMOR2 Trial. In Part 2 of ARMOR2, we enrolled 98 patients and evaluated galeterone dosed at 2550 mg/day in the following CRPC populations: 
 

 | non-metastatic CRPC and mCRPC treatment-naïve patients;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | Zytiga-refractory patients; and
--+--------------------------------


 | patients whose disease progressed during treatment with Xtandi, whom we refer to as Xtandi-refractory patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary endpoints for Part 2 of ARMOR2 were as follows: 
 

 | Treatment-naïve patients: percentage of patients having a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 30% from baseline to the end of the primary treatment phase; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Zytiga-refractory and Xtandi-refractory patients: percentage of change in PSA levels from baseline to the end of the primary treatment phase.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional endpoints included incidence of adverse events, change from baseline in safety parameters, response rate, and CTC enumeration and characterization, including for the evaluation of C-terminal androgen receptor expression in relation to N-terminal androgen receptor expression to identify C-terminal loss and the lack of a functional ligand binding domain. 
 Patients enrolled in Part 2 of the trial received treatment with galeterone at a dose of 2550 mg/day for an initial period of up to 12 weeks, followed by optional continued dosing in an extension phase for those patients who tolerated treatment and did not show signs of disease progression. Treatment continued until disease progression or patient withdrawal due to adverse events or other reasons. 
 Phase 2 Data Presentation. In November 2014, we presented interim efficacy and safety data from our ARMOR2 trial for patients who received the 2550 mg/day dose of galeterone at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, or EORTC. 
 In 60 evaluable treatment-naïve CRPC patients in Part 1 and Part 2 of the trial who received the 2550 mg/day dose of galeterone, during the first 12 weeks of dosing, 83% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 30%, and 70% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 50%. In 38 treatment-naïve mCRPC patients who received the 2550 mg/day dose, during the first 12 weeks of dosing, 84% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 30%, and 76% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 50%. 
 We also reported 12-week data for 37 Zytiga-refractory patients, 13 of whom showed a reduction in PSA levels, and nine Xtandi-refractory patients, five of whom showed a reduction in PSA levels. 
 Of the 16 treatment-naïve patients evaluable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, three patients had a partial response and 11 patients had stable disease. Fifteen of the Zytiga-refractory patients and three of the Xtandi-refractory patients were evaluable by RECIST. Of these patients, five Zytiga-refractory patients had stable disease, and one Xtandi-refractory patient had stable disease. As measured by RECIST criteria, stable disease is achieved when the tumor has not increased in size by 20% and has not decreased by 30%, a partial response occurs when the tumor has decreased in size by at least 30%, and progressive disease occurs when the tumor has increased in size by at least 20% or new tumor lesions are identified. 
 
7 
 
Our ARMOR2 trial included CTC enumeration and characterization. At EORTC, we presented data from a retrospective subset analysis in which seven treatment-naïve CRPC patients in ARMOR2 were identified as having C-terminal loss as determined by the evaluation of C-terminal androgen receptor expression in relation to N-terminal androgen receptor expression. Six of these patients had maximal reductions in PSA levels of at least 50%. The seventh patient, who did not show any PSA reduction, discontinued therapy due to an adverse event unrelated to galeterone after approximately six weeks in the trial and did not receive the full treatment regimen. 
 At EORTC, we also presented interim safety results from all 107 patients treated in the 2550 mg/day dose cohort as of October 14, 2014 in ARMOR2. In these patients, galeterone was well tolerated. Approximately 90% of all treatment-emergent related adverse events reported were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were generally manageable and reversible. The majority of these events were assessed as not related or unlikely related to galeterone. In addition, there were no reported cases of seizure or mineralocorticoid excess. The most common treatment-emergent related adverse events were nausea, fatigue, pruritus, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypokalemia and vomiting. 
 As of January 31, 2017, nine of the 126 patients enrolled in ARMOR2 had experienced a serious adverse event that was assessed by the investigator as related or possibly related to the administration of galeterone. No single treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in more than one patient and no adverse events had resulted in interruptions or delays of the clinical trial. 
 ARMOR3-SV
In June 2015, we initiated ARMOR3-SV, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of galeterone. The ARMOR3-SV trial was designed to compare galeterone to Xtandi in approximately 148 treatment-naïve mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant. Under the trial protocol, patients were randomized on a one-to-one basis to receive either galeterone or the control arm treatment, Xtandi. Patients in the galeterone arm received a dose of 2550 mg/day, and patients in the Xtandi arm received a dose of 160 mg/day. Treatment was continued until radiographic evidence of disease progression as determined by a blinded, independent central imaging assessment or patient withdrawal due to adverse events or other reasons. 
 Only patients with the AR-V7 splice variant were enrolled in the trial. These patients were identified by analysis of a blood sample at a central laboratory using an AR-V7 specific clinical trial assay developed under our collaboration with Qiagen Manchester Limited, or Qiagen, which we terminated effective September 2016 following our discontinuation of the trial. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial was rPFS as determined by a blinded, independent central imaging assessment measured from the time of patient randomization to the time of radiographic evidence of disease progression or time of death from any cause. In order to achieve the primary endpoint, results from the trial needed to demonstrate an 82% increase in median rPFS in the galeterone arm as compared to the Xtandi arm. Such a result would be statistically significant and would likely have been considered a clinically relevant outcome. The secondary endpoints included overall survival, safety, and time to next anti-cancer intervention or time to next cytotoxic therapy. 
 ARMOR3-SV was conducted at over 100 clinical sites in several countries in North America, Western Europe and Australia. 
 On July 25, 2016, the independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, for the ARMOR3-SV trial met to review safety and efficacy data from the trial. Based on a review of all available safety and efficacy data, the DMC determined that the ARMOR3-SV trial would likely not succeed in meeting its primary endpoint of demonstrating an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival for galeterone versus enzalutamide in men with AR-V7 positive mCRPC and recommended that enrollment in the trial be ceased. In making its recommendation, the DMC did not cite any safety concerns with galeterone in the trial. On July 26, 2016, we 
 
8 
 
 publicly disclosed our plans to discontinue the ARMOR3-SV trial. We conducted a review of unblinded data from the ARMOR3-SV clinical trial to evaluate potential paths forward for galeterone and our ARDA program. Based on data reviewed to date, there is a substantial likelihood that we will not pursue the development of galeterone in AR-V7 positive mCRPC in the future. 
 Androgen Receptor Degradation Compounds 
 In conjunction with a license from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, or UMB, we have a drug discovery program, known as ARDA (androgen receptor degradation agents), under which we identified novel compounds designed to have potent androgen receptor degradation activity. Our most advanced series of compounds from this program is currently in preclinical development. We planned to target compounds developed under our ARDA program for patients with androgen receptor signaling diseases, including prostate cancer, either alone or in combination with other products. We are evaluating potential paths forward for our ARDA program in connection with our review of galeterone. 
Manufacturing 
 Galeterone is a small molecule drug candidate that is manufactured through a reproducible synthetic process from readily available raw materials. Galeterone is manufactured in a proprietary formulation based on spray dried dispersion technology that is designed to produce a product that provides consistent drug exposure. 
 We do not have our own manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. 
 Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs which may render our products obsolete even before they generate any revenue. We face competition with respect to our lead product candidate, and will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we were developing galeterone. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Many marketed therapies for the indications that we were pursuing, or indications that we may in the future seek to address, are widely accepted by physicians, patients and payors, which may make it difficult for us to replace them with any products that we successfully develop and are permitted to market. 
 We were developing galeterone for multiple prostate cancer patient populations. If galeterone were approved for any of these indications, it would compete with commonly-used oral hormonal treatments being marketed, such as Zytiga and Xtandi, chemotherapeutic agents, or with drug candidates currently in development. Galeterone could compete in the future with products, either hormonal or non-hormonal, marketed by several of the worlds largest and most experienced pharmaceutical companies. These companies have substantially more financial resources than we do and greater flexibility to engage in aggressive price competition to gain revenues and market share. Approved second-generation hormonal treatments in the United 
 
9 
 
 States for CRPC include Zytiga, marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Xtandi, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc. and Medivation, Inc. Approved non-hormonal agents for CRPC include Taxotere® (docetaxel) and Jevtana® (cabazitaxel), marketed by sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC; Provenge® (sipuleucel-T), marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.; and Xofigo® (radium-223), marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. It is uncertain whether we could compete with such products, and our failure to compete or decision to reduce the price of galeterone or other future products we may develop in order to compete could severely impact our business. In addition, there are numerous prostate cancer products in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types. 
 Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render galeterone or any future product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, medical and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of any of our product candidates, if approved, will be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, probability of drug resistance, convenience of dosage regimen, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that is important or necessary to commercialize our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms. We may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in which case our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional compounds and their derivatives. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies.

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions can be maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings at the USPTO or at a foreign patent office, such as inter partes review and post grant review proceedings at the USPTO and opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 
 We generally file a provisional patent application with the USPTO first and then subsequently file a corresponding non-provisional patent application, which enables us to establish an earlier effective filing date in the subsequently filed non-provisional patent application. In order to benefit from the earlier effective filing date, we must file a corresponding non-provisional patent application, such as a utility application in the United States or an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, within 12 months of the date of the provisional patent application filing. Based on the PCT filing, we may file national and regional patent applications in the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa or the Eurasian Patent Organization. To date, we have not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available, and we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before a patent is granted. In addition, the patent grant proceeding for each national or regional patent application that we file is an independent proceeding. As a result, it is possible for a patent application to be granted in one jurisdiction and denied in another jurisdiction, and depending on the jurisdiction, the scope of patent protection may vary. 
 Galeterone Patent Portfolio 
 Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for product candidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of January 31, 2017, we owned and/or licensed 18 issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending international patent applications, 88 granted foreign patents and 67 pending foreign applications in our galeterone patent portfolio. Our owned and/or licensed patent and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2017 through 2036, without taking into account any possible patent term extensions. Upon the expiration of these patents, we will lose the right to exclude others from practicing the inventions claimed by such patents. As a result, the expiration of these patents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 We have no patent protection specifically covering the chemical structure of galeterone. As a result, a third party that obtains regulatory approval of a product with the same active ingredient as galeterone may be able to market such product so long as the third party does not infringe any other patents owned or licensed by us with respect to galeterone. For this reason, we have filed for or licensed patents and patent applications relating to galeterone covering methods of use, pharmaceutical compositions, combination treatments, prodrugs, metabolites, and analogs of galeterone and their use. 
 Method of Use. We have licensed from UMB a U.S. patent covering a method of treating prostate cancer in a human subject by administering galeterone, which is expected to expire in 2027. The license also includes 
 
11 
 
 granted patents in the European Patent Convention and Japan covering the use of galeterone to treat prostate disease, including prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplasia. Similar patents have been granted or allowed in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and the Eurasian Patent Organization. These patents are expected to expire in 2026. In addition, we have pending applications in Brazil, China, India, Israel and Indonesia. We have also licensed from UMB a PCT patent application covering the use of galeterone to inhibit proliferation of a cell having a specific splice variant form of the androgen receptor. The term of a patent derived from this PCT application, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2034. 
 We have also filed a PCT patent application covering the use of galeterone in treating prostate cancer mediated by androgen receptor variants, including splice variants such as AR-V7, as well as the use of biomarkers in identifying patients who are expected to respond to treatment with galeterone. This application is jointly owned with UMB and the University of Washington, and we have exclusively licensed those institutions undivided interest in such application and any resulting patents. The term of a patent derived from this PCT application, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2034. 
 Pharmaceutical Compositions. We have filed U.S. and international patent applications relating to a galeterone formulation and its use where the galeterone is present in a spray dried dispersion. We have pending applications in the United States, the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India and Japan. The term of any patent in this family, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2032. In addition, we have licensed from UMB a U.S. patent application covering a pharmaceutical composition of galeterone. The term of any patent, if issued, claiming priority to this application would be expected to expire in 2026. 
 Prodrugs, Metabolites and Analogs. We have filed patent applications or licensed from UMB patent applications directed to prodrugs, metabolites or analogs of galeterone. For example, we have licensed a U.S. patent application from UMB directed to certain prodrugs of galeterone. If issued, the term of the resulting patent, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2029. We have also filed patent applications in the United States and certain other countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India and Japan directed to other prodrugs of galeterone. If issued, the term of the resulting patents would be expected to expire in 2030. Further, we have filed patent applications in the United States and certain other countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India and Japan directed to compounds which have been identified as metabolites of galeterone and which may be biologically active. If issued, the term of the resulting patents would be expected to expire in 2030. We have also obtained a license to a UMB PCT patent application directed to analogs of galeterone that disrupt androgen receptor signaling by degrading the androgen receptor. The term of any patent, if issued, claiming priority to this PCT patent application would be expected to extend to 2034. 
 AR-V7 Specific Assay and Companion Diagnostic Test. We have an exclusive license from The Johns Hopkins University, or Johns Hopkins, for patent applications in the United States, Europe, and Canada covering methods of determining whether a subject may respond to androgen therapy, and methods of determining a subjects risk of recurrence of hormone-refractory or hormone-naïve prostate cancer. If issued, the term of the resulting patents would be expected to expire in 2029. These patent applications may provide protection for an AR-V7 specific assay or companion diagnostic test using this assay that we may develop and commercialize. However, these patent applications do not provide any protection for galeterone or for galeterones pharmaceutical formulations or uses. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining 
 
12 
 
 term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individuals relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 
 License Agreement with University of Maryland, Baltimore 
 In May 2006, we entered into a master license agreement with UMB. Pursuant to the license agreement, UMB granted us an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents and patent applications to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain anti-androgen steroids including galeterone, which we refer to as licensed products, and to otherwise practice the patent rights in any manner, for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment or control of any human or animal disease. In addition, UMB granted us a first option to receive an exclusive license to UMBs rights in certain improvements to the licensed products, which improvements we refer to as licensed improvements. We have exercised our option and acquired exclusive rights to licensed improvements under four amendments to the license agreement. In March 2009, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license to oral prodrugs of the licensed products. In April 2012, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license to compositions and methods of inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. In October 2013, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license to a patent application directed to analogs of galeterone that disrupt androgen receptor signaling by degrading the androgen receptor. In March 2016, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license for the use of galeterone and other compounds previously licensed from UMB for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. 
 Under the terms of the license agreement, as amended, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more licensed products. We must also achieve specified milestone events by specified dates. UMB may terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve such milestone events and do not cure such failure within a specified termination notice period. UMB may also terminate the agreement upon our breach of our payment obligations or our other material breaches under the agreement if we do not cure such breach within a specified notice period or upon our bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement at any time, on a country-by-country basis, if we determine that a license under the licensed patent rights in an applicable country is not advantageous to our commercial success, provided that our payment obligations with respect to licensed products in such country would survive termination if we continued to develop and commercialize licensed products in such country following such a termination. Unless our license agreement with UMB is terminated earlier as provided above, our exclusive license from UMB expires on a 
 
13 
 
 country-by-country basis as of the later of the expiration date of the last to expire of the claims of the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. 
 In consideration for the rights granted to us, we made an upfront payment to UMB of $20,000 following the execution of the license agreement and a payment of $10,000 following the execution of each of the March 2009, April 2012, October 2013 and March 2016 amendments. We are obligated to pay UMB an annual maintenance fee of $10,000 each year until the first commercial sale. In addition, we paid UMB a $50,000 milestone payment in 2009 upon the submission of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for galeterone and a $40,000 milestone payment in 2013 upon the issuance of the first patent related to UMBs prodrug patent application. We are obligated to make an additional $50,000 milestone payment to UMB for each additional IND we file for a licensed product and a $100,000 milestone payment upon the approval of each NDA for a licensed product by the FDA. In addition, under the March 2016 amendment to the license agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments of $50,000 upon the first-in-human dosing of a patient with a pancreatic cancer licensed product and $100,000 upon dosing of the first patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a pancreatic cancer licensed product. We must also pay UMB a low-single digit percentage royalty on aggregate worldwide net sales of licensed products, including sales by our sublicensees, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire applicable licensed patent or ten years after first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case in the applicable country. Our royalty obligations are subject to specified reductions in the event that we are required to obtain additional licenses from third parties or in the event of specified competition from third-party products licensed by UMB. Our minimum annual royalty payment to UMB is $50,000 beginning in the year following the year in which the first commercial sale occurs. We must also pay UMB 10% of all non-royalty sublicense income received from sublicensees. Finally, as of April 10, 2012, we assumed responsibility for all patent expenses related to the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents. 
 License Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University 
 In January 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Johns Hopkins. Pursuant to the license agreement, Johns Hopkins granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent applications and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, with the right to sublicense, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain assays to identify androgen receptor variants for use as a companion diagnostic with galeterone. In addition, Johns Hopkins granted us an option to negotiate an exclusive license to Johns Hopkinss rights in certain improvements to the licensed products. 
 Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to diligently develop, manufacture and sell licensed products. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve specified milestone events by specified dates. Unless the license agreement with Johns Hopkins is terminated earlier as provided below, the license from Johns Hopkins expires on a country-by-country basis as of the later of the expiration date of the last to expire of the claims of the patent rights licensed under the agreement in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. Johns Hopkins may terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve such milestone events and do not cure such failure within a specified termination notice period. Johns Hopkins may also terminate the agreement upon a material breach by us under the agreement if we do not cure such breach within a specified notice period or upon bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days notice. 
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we made an upfront payment to Johns Hopkins of $75,000 following the execution of the license agreement. We are obligated to pay Johns Hopkins an annual minimum royalty of up to $30,000. We are also obligated to make milestone payments to Johns Hopkins upon the achievement of specified technical and commercial milestones. We paid $50,000 during 2015 related to the achievement of two of these milestones. If all such milestones are achieved, the total milestone payments owed to Johns Hopkins would equal in the aggregate $700,000. We must also pay Johns 
 
14 
 
 Hopkins single digit percentage royalties on aggregate worldwide net sales of licensed products (and not galeterone), including sales by sublicensees, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire applicable licensed patent or ten years after first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case in the applicable country. These royalty obligations are subject to specified reductions in the event that additional licenses from third parties are required. We must also pay Johns Hopkins 20% of all non-royalty sublicense income received from sublicensees and reimburse them for patent costs. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and associated implementing regulations. The failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing process, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15 
 

 | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, as applicable, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Additional preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Typically, the FDA will require one IND for early development studies where the sponsor is uncertain of the indication or dosage form of the proposed product, where the drug is being developed for closely related indications within a single review division at FDA, or where there are multiple closely-related routes of administration using the same dosage formulation. On the other hand, multiple INDs may be required where there are two or more unrelated conditions being developed or where multiple dosage forms are being extensively investigated or where multiple routes of administration are being evaluated. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease such as cancer or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
 Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 
16 
 
Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials, which typically denotes a trial which generates the principal data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. In Phase 3 trials, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate the clinical trial, or the data monitoring committee for a clinical trial may recommend suspension or termination, at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical trials which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAs previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDAs previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies, trials or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2017 is $2,038,100. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which for 2017 are $97,750 per product and $512,200 per establishment. 
 
17 
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDAs receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under the agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for priority review are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a 
 
18 
 
 fast track products NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as breakthrough therapies. A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDAs goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
 
19 
 
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsors agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drugs clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDAs Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDAs evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and 
 
20 
 
 impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. The DSCA imposes requires to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug  
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred 
 
21 
 
 to as the Orange Book. Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDAs designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicants product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
 

 | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


 | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved products listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 
22 
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDAs internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDAs request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent restoration of up to five 
 
23 
 
 years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the products approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 The 21st Century Cures Act 
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increasing funding for FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases. 
 With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new limited population approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy, thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations. 
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the EU 
 Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a 
 
24 
 
 competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation, which will be directly applicable to and binding without the need for any national implementing legislation. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 
 Approval of Drug Products in the EU 
 To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member states assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically 
 
25 
 
 debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the EU. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of clinically relevant superiority by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a companys revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In the European Union, pricing and 
 
26 
 
 reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law, known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
27 
 

 | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform in the United States 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last several years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential drug candidates are: 
 

 | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded manufacturers rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The Affordable Care Act provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and

 | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 With the new Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. To that end, on January 20, 2017, the President issued an Executive Order Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal. The Executive Order declares that, pending repeal of the Affordable Care Act, it is imperative for the executive branch to ensure that the law is being efficiently implemented, take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Act, and prepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market. The Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to exercise their authority and discretion to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications. 
 With respect to repeal of the Affordable Care Act and its replacement with new legislation, it is unclear when such legislation will be enacted, what it will provide and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the costs of healthcare.
