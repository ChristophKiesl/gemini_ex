ITEM 1.           BUSINESS.
 Overview of Our Business
Our Dalian manufacturing facilities began its partial commercial operations in July 2015. We are now engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling new energy high power lithium batteries, which are mainly used in the following applications: 

Electric vehicles (EV), such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid
 electric cars and buses;
 Light electric vehicles (LEV), such as electric bicycles, electric
 motors, sight-seeing cars; and
 Electric tools, energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, and other
 high power applications. 
 We have received most of the operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies of our former subsidiary, BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. (BAK Tianjin). Such assets were acquired in exchange for a reduction in receivables from our former subsidiaries that were disposed in June 2014. We have outsourced and will continue to outsource our production to other manufacturers until our Dalian manufacturing facility can fulfill our customers needs. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, Dalian BAK Power purchased batteries of approximately of $2.7 million from BAK Tianjin. 
 We generated revenues of $10.4 million and $13.9 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had a net loss of $12.7 million in 2016 and a net profit of $15.9 million in 2015. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $139.8 million and net assets of $15.1 million. We had a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit from recurring net losses and short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of September 30, 2016. 
 On June 14, 2016, we renewed our banking facilities from Bank of Dandong for loans with a maximum amount of RMB130 million (approximately $19.5 million), including three-year long-term loans and three-year revolving bank acceptance and letters of credit bills for the period from June 13, 2016 to June 12, 2019. The banking facilities were guaranteed by Mr. Yunfei Li (Mr. Li), our CEO, and Ms. Qinghui Yuan, Mr. Lis wife, Mr. Xianqian Li, our former CEO, Ms. Xiaoqiu Yu, the wife of our former CEO, Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd., our former subsidiary (Shenzhen BAK). The facilities were also secured by part of our Dalian sites prepaid land use rights, buildings, construction in progress, machinery and equipment and pledged deposits. Under the banking facilities, from June to September 2016, we borrowed various three-year term bank loans that totaled RMB126.8 million (approximately $19.0 million), bearing fixed interest at 7.2% per annum. We also borrowed a series of revolving bank acceptance totaled $0.6 million from Bank of Dandong under the credit facilities, and bank deposit of 50% was required to secure against these bank acceptance bills.
 On July 6, 2016, we obtained banking facilities from Bank of Dalian for loans with a maximum amount of RMB10 million (approximately $1.5 million) and bank acceptance bills of RMB40 million (approximately $6.0 million) to July 2017. The banking facilities were guaranteed by Mr. Li, our CEO, and Ms. Qinghui Yuan, Mr. Lis wife, and Shenzhen BAK. Under the banking facilities, on July 6, 2016 we borrowed one year short-term loan of RMB10 million (approximately $1.5 million), bearing a fixed interest rate at 6.525% per annum. We also borrowed revolving bank acceptance totaled $6.0 million, and bank deposit of 50% was required to secure against these bank acceptance bills.
 In June 2016, we received advances in the aggregate of $2.9 million from Mr. Jiping Zhou and Mr. Dawei Li. These advances were unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand. On July 8, 2016, we received further advances of $2.6 million from Mr. Jiping Zhou. On July 28, 2016, to convert these advances into equity interests in our Company, we entered into securities purchase agreements with Mr. Jiping Zhou and Mr. Dawei Li to issue and sell an aggregate of 2,206,640 shares of our common stock, at $2.5 per share, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $5.52 million. On August 17, 2016, we issued these shares to the investors. 
 In the meanwhile, due to the growing environmental pollution problem, the Chinese government is currently providing vigorous support to the new energy facilities and vehicles. It is expected that we will be able to secure more potential orders from the new energy market, especially from the electric car market. We believe with that the booming market demand in high power lithium ion products, we can continue as a going concern and return to profitability.

To promote the development of new energy electric vehicles, in April 2015, the central government of China issued Notice of Financial Support Policies for the Promotion of New Energy Vehicles in 2016-2020, which regulated favorable government subsidies for the new energy electric vehicles for years from 2016 to 2020. It led to the explosive growth in the production and selling of new electric vehicles in 2015. However, in January 2016, as it was reported that there were widespread frauds involved in obtaining government subsidies, the central government launched investigations among the electric vehicles industry. Before the completion of the investigation, the subsidies for 2015 were ceased to be granted to the manufacturers of electric vehicles, and it was said that the subsidies policy for 2016 to 2020 would be revised accordingly. Due to the continued investigation and unclear government policies, almost all the new energy electric vehicle manufacturers suspended or decreased the production and selling of electric vehicles in 2016. Accordingly, the production and selling of power batteries for use in electric vehicles dramatically decreased in 2016. In November 2016 the central government announced the result of investigation, including the list of manufacturers of electric vehicles who committed alleged frauds and the related penalties. On December 29, 2016, the Ministry of Finance of China finally issued the revised subsidy policy named Notice of Revision to Financial Support Policies for the Promotion of New Energy Vehicles in 2016-2020, which revised the subsidies standard to be based on cost and technology of the power batteries, and set up the maximum amount of the subsidies from the central and local governments. The revised subsidy policy also raised the standard and threshold for the quality of electric vehicles and power batteries, confirmed the responsibility of the manufacturers of electric vehicles, and strengthened the penalty system. 
 In March 2015, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (the MIIT) issued the Requirements of the Industry Standards for the Auto Power Storage Batteries ("Requirements"), which are applicable to auto power battery manufacturers located in China. In order to be certified as qualified manufacturers under Requirements, manufacturers are required to be examined by quality inspecting agencies appointed by Administration of Quality Inspection under Requirements after the manufacturers have obtained the following reports and certificates: 
 1. Environmental Acceptance Report;
2. Fire Acceptance Report;
3. New National Standard Certificate of Power Battery: GB/T 31484-2015, GB/T 31485-2015 and GB/T 31486-2015;
4. OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System;
5. ISO14001 Environmental Management System; and
6. Occupational Health Report Occupational Health Report. 

 We have obtained all the above listed required reports and certificates. While we believe that we meet all of the conditions listed under the Requirements, there is no assurance that the certification will be granted to us by the MIIT. During the transition period in 2015 and the beginning of 2016, electric automobile manufacturers were able to obtain subsidies from the governments even though their power battery suppliers were not as qualified manufacturers under the Requirements. Subsequent to that period and prior to obtaining the certification from the MIIT, we have been cooperating with Shenzhen BAK, our former subsidiary, or other qualified companies under the Requirements, by selling our key materials to those battery manufacturers for them to manufacture, pack, test and use their own process produce and sell end products in compliance with the Requirements to electric automobile manufacturers. From September 2016, the MIIT ceased to certify auto power battery manufacturers under the Requirements. Also it is reported that the compliance with Requirements will not be deemed as a precondition for qualified manufacturers of power batteries for use in electric vehicles. In the newly issued Notice of Revision to Financial Support Policies for the Promotion of New Energy Vehicles in 2016-2020, compliance with the Requirements was not listed as a precondition for qualified manufacturers of power batteries to be used in electric vehicles to obtain government subsidies. 
Our Corporate History and Structure 
 We conduct our current business through the following two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China that we own through BAK Asia:
 
 | Dalian BAK Trading, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on August 14, 2013, which focuses on the wholesale of lithium batteries and lithium batteries materials, import & export business and related technology consulting service; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Dalian BAK Power, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on December 27, 2013, which focuses on the development and manufacture of high-power lithium batteries. 

 Almost all of our business operations are conducted primarily through our Chinese subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure:

Our Products
 The use of new materials have enabled the configuration of high-power lithium battery cells to contain much higher energy density and higher voltage and have a longer life cycle and shorter charge time than other types of lithium-based batteries. These special attributes, coupled with intrinsic safety features, are suitable for batteries used for high-power applications, such as electric cars, electric bicycles, electric tools, energy storage and uninterruptible power supply, or UPS. 
 We believe high power lithium batteries represent the main direction of the development of new energy vehicle technologies according to the 12th Five-Year Plan published by the Chinese government.
 Our Dalian manufacturing facilities focus on the development and manufacture of high power lithium batteries, for use in the following end applications:
 
Battery Cell Type | End applications* 
---------------------------+--------------------------------------------
High-power lithium battery | Electric bus [6,000-20,000] 
 | Electric car [1,500-3,5000] 
 | Hybrid electric vehicle [500-2000] 
 | Light electric vehicle [10-150] 
 | Cordless power tool [10-30] 
 | Uninterruptible power supply [30-300] 
 | Energy Storage [>300 ] 

 * Bracketed numbers denote number of cells per particular battery.
 Key High Power Lithium Battery Applications 
 End-product applications that are driving the demand for high power lithium batteries include electric vehicles, such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; light electric vehicles, such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and electric tools, energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, and other high power applications.
 Electric Vehicles
An electric vehicle, sometimes referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric buses, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, and hybrid electric vehicles, plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric spacecraft. Electric cars and electric buses are propelled by one or more electric motors powered by rechargeable battery packs. Electric cars and buses have the potential to significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Electric cars and buses are also expected to have less dependence on oil. World governments are pledging significant funds to fund the development of electric vehicles and their components due in part to these advantages. Due to these factors and a lithium batterys relatively environmentally-friendly, light-weight and high-capacity features, the demand for lithium batteries in the field of electric cars and buses is increasing.

Due to such recent trends as renewed concerns relating to the availability and price of oil, increased legal fuel-efficiency requirements and incentives, and heightened interest in environmentally-friendly or green technologies, hybrid electric vehicles are likely to continue to attract substantial interest from vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Hybrid electric vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles that combine a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system to achieve better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. As these vehicles tend to be large and heavy, their rechargeable energy storage system generally consists of a large quantity of rechargeable high-power lithium cells. 
 The year 2014 was seen as the first real year for the development of China's new energy vehicle industry by many industry insiders. After explosive growth in 2015, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued to grow tremendously in 2016. According to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, from January to October 2016, the production of new energy vehicles in China reached 355,000 units - up 77.9 percent year-on-year; and sales in China reached 337,000 units - up 82.2 percent year-on-year. As the core mechanism for new energy vehicles, the power battery industry has also recently welcomed an unprecedented growth. According to the Development Program for the Energy Efficient and New Energy Vehicle Industry 2012-2020 designed by the State Council of the PRC, some major objectives are: to enthusiastically advance innovation in power battery technologies; scientifically plan the industrial layout; focus on developing power battery industry clusters; and actively promote the mass production of power batteries. With the recent introduction of a number of supporting policies, the production of power batteries for vehicles has grown remarkably.
 Light Electric Vehicles
 Light electric vehicles include bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles, with rechargeable electric motors. Due to their relatively small size and light design, approximately 10-150 high-power lithium cells can be used to power light electric vehicles. The electric bicycle market in China is huge. According to MIIT, from January to September 2016, the production of electric bicycles in China was 22.6 million units, up 4.6% year-on-year. 
Energy Storage
 Energy storage mainly means storage of electric energy by battery, inductor, and capacitor. Battery energy storage is mainly used for storage of emergency supply, battery car, and redundant energy of power plants.
 Electric Tools
Electric tools such as drills, saws and grinders are used for both commercial and personal use. Due to high power requirements, many electric tools have historically used small combustion engines, used heavier nickel metal hydride batteries or relied on external power sources. Manufacturers of electric tools, such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., the Bosch Group, Metabowerke GmbH and Rigid Tool Company have begun to use lithium-ion technology. The market for portable high-powered electric tools is rapidly growing and has prompted many users, both commercial and personal, to replace or upgrade their current power tools. 
Uninterruptible Power Supplies
 A UPS provides emergency power from a separate source when utility power is not available. The most common type of battery used in UPS is Sealed Lead-Acid, however, due to the lithium batterys relatively small size, light design and environmentally-friendly features, the demand for lithium batteries in this industry is increasing.
 Revenue by Products
Before June 30, 2014, we derived our revenues from BAK International and its subsidiaries which produced prismatic cells, cylindrical cells, lithium polymer cells and high-power lithium batteries. Since July 1, 2014, our revenue has been mainly from Dalian BAK Power for sale of batteries manufactured by BAK Tianjin under outsourcing arrangements. Starting from October 2015, we generated revenues from high-power lithium battery cells manufactured by Dalian BAK Power as well as batteries outsourced from BAK Tianjin and other manufacturers. The following table sets forth the breakdown of our net revenues by product types:

Sales and Marketing
 We plan to build an extensive sales and service network in China, highlighted by our presence in the regions where Chinas main EV and LEV productions is located, such as Beijing, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province, Sichuan Province and three provinces in Northeast China. We intend to gradually establish post-sales service offices in these areas to serve brand owners and pack manufacturers in each designated area as currently our marketing department at headquarters is responsible for our promoting efforts. In doing so, our sales staff works closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide feedback to us so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products.
 We also engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities are conducive in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants.
 Suppliers
 The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries include electrode materials, cases and caps, foils, electrolyte and separators. Cost of these raw materials is a key factor in pricing our products. We believe that there is an ample supply of most of the raw materials we need in China. We are seeking to identify alternative raw material suppliers to the extent there are viable alternatives and to expand our use of alternative raw materials. 
 We aim to maintain multiple supply sources for each of our key raw materials to ensure that supply problems with any one supplier will not materially disrupt our operations. In addition, we strive to develop strategic relationships with new suppliers to secure a stable supply of materials and introduce competition in our supply chain, thereby increasing our ability to negotiate better pricing and reducing our exposure to possible price fluctuations.
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, our key raw material suppliers were as follows:
