B. UTILITY ENERGY OPERATIONS
Wisconsin Segment
Electric Utility Operations
For the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our electric utility operations included operations of WE for all periods and operations for WPS beginning July 1, 2015, due to the acquisition of Integrys and its subsidiaries. WE, which is the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in southeastern Wisconsin (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central Wisconsin, and northern Wisconsin, and serves an iron ore mine owned by Tilden Mining Company (Tilden) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. For more information on the mine, see the discussion below under the heading "Large Electric Retail Customers." WPS generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in northeastern Wisconsin.

2016 Form 10-K | 3 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Through December 31, 2016, WE and WPS serviced electric customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Effective January 1, 2017, WE and WPS transferred their electric customers and electric distribution assets located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC, a new stand-alone utility. More information about UMERC is included at the end of the Wisconsin Segment section, under the heading "Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation." The operations of UMERC will continue to be reported as a part of the Wisconsin segment.

(1) | Includes the operations of WPS beginning July 1, 2015, as a result of the acquisition of Integrys on June 29, 2015.


(2) | Includes distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in Michigan.


(3) | Includes SSR revenue, amounts collected from (refunded to) customers for certain fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from costs included in rates, and other revenues, partially offset by revenues from the mines that are being deferred until a future rate proceeding. For more information, see the discussion below under the heading "Large Electric Retail Customers."

Electric Sales
Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail and wholesale customers and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier. In 2016, retail electric revenues accounted for 86.8% of total electric operating revenues, while wholesale and resale electric revenues accounted for 10.3% of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on MWh sales by customer class.
Our electric utilities are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. 
Our electric utilities buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets, compared to our competitors, affects how often our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For more information, see Item 1. Business – D. Regulation.
Steam Sales
WE has a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by VAPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions. In April 2016, we sold the MCPP steam generation and distribution assets, located in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. MCPP primarily provided steam to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center hospitals and other campus buildings. See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information. 

2016 Form 10-K | 4 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Electric Sales Forecast
Our service territory experienced increased weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2016 due to both positive customer growth as well as the retirement of some customer generation as a result of EPA regulations. However, we currently forecast retail electric sales volumes, excluding the Tilden mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to remain relatively flat over the next five years, assuming normal weather. The associated electric peak demand is expected to grow at a rate of approximately 0.1% over the next five years, also assuming normal weather. The expected decline in retail electric sales volumes is due in part to the closing of a large industrial customer at the end of 2016 and continued energy conservation by our customers.

Steam customers – average | 0.4 | | 0.4 | | 0.4 

Large Electric Retail Customers
We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as paper, governmental, food products, foundry, mining, health services, printing, and retail. In February 2015, our largest retail electric customers, two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, returned as customers after choosing an alternative electric supplier in September 2013. For more information on alternative electric suppliers, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Industry Restructuring. WE entered into a contract with each of the mines to provide full requirements electric service through December 31, 2019. Since 2015, we have been deferring, and expect to continue to defer, the revenue less costs of sales from the mine sales and will apply these amounts for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. 
In 2016, one of the iron ore mines closed, and the related contract for full requirements electric service was terminated. In August 2016, we entered into a new agreement with the owner of the remaining mine under which it will purchase electric power from UMERC for 20 years. The agreement also calls for UMERC to construct and operate certain natural gas-fired generation located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The remaining iron ore mine will continue to receive full requirements electric service from WE under the existing contract, as discussed above, until UMERC's proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan begins commercial operation. See Note 22, Regulatory Environment, for more information, as well as the discussion under the heading "Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation" below. 
Wholesale Customers
We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. Wholesale sales accounted for 7.4%, 6.0%, and 5.3% of total electric energy sales during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Wholesale revenues accounted for 5.0%, 4.5%, and 3.8% of total electric operating revenues during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Resale
The majority of our sales for resale are sold to one RTO, MISO, at market rates based on availability of our generation and RTO demand. Resale sales accounted for 17.5%, 20.9%, and 18.5% of total electric energy sales during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Resale revenues accounted for 5.3%, 6.1%, and 7.7% of total electric operating revenues during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the costs of sales derived from these opportunity sales.

Electric Generation and Supply Mix
Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed under the heading "Power Purchase Commitments," and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess capacity into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power.
Our rated capacity by fuel type as of December 31 is shown below. For more information on our electric generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties. 

 | Rated Capacity in MW (1)
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Coal | 4,933 | | 4,955 | | 3,707
Natural gas: | | | | 
Combined cycle | 1,697 | | 1,636 | | 1,082
Steam turbine (2) | 320 | | 305 | | 118 
Natural gas/oil peaking units (3) | 1,413 | | 1,412 | | 962 
Renewables (4) | 273 | | 269 | | 155 
Total rated capacity | 8,636 | | 8,577 | | 6,024


(1) | Rated capacity is the net power output under average operating conditions with equipment in an average state of repair as of a given month in a given year. We are a summer peaking electric utility, and amounts are based on expected capacity ratings for the following summer. The values were established by tests and may change slightly from year to year.


(2) | The natural gas steam turbine represents the rated capacity associated with the VAPP Units, which were converted from coal to natural gas in 2014 and 2015, as well as Weston Unit 2, which was converted from coal to natural gas in 2015.


(3) | The dual-fueled facilities generally burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the natural gas pipeline and/or at the local natural gas distribution company that delivers natural gas to the plants.


(4) | Includes hydroelectric, biomass, and wind generation.

The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales for the three years ended December 31, as well as estimates for 2017:

Coal-Fired Generation
Our coal-fired generation consists of eight operating plants with a rated capacity of 4,933 MW as of December 31, 2016. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Natural Gas-Fired Generation
Our natural gas-fired generation consists of nine operating plants, including peaking units, with a rated capacity of 3,250 MW as of December 31, 2016. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Oil-Fired Generation
Fuel oil is used for combustion turbines at certain of our natural gas-fired plants as well as for ignition and flame stabilization at one of our coal-fired plants. Our oil-fired generation had a rated capacity of 180 MW as of December 31, 2016. We also have natural gas-fired peaking units with a rated capacity of 1,221 MW, which have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Renewable Generation
In order to comply with renewable energy legislation in Wisconsin and Michigan, our electric utilities meet a portion of their electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources. 
Hydroelectric
Our hydroelectric generating system consists of 30 operating plants with a total installed capacity of 171 MW and a rated capacity of 150 MW as of December 31, 2016. All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 
Wind
We have six wind sites, consisting of 280 turbines, with an installed capacity of 447 MW and a rated capacity of 73 MW as of December 31, 2016. 
Biomass
We have a biomass-fueled power plant at a Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce a rated capacity of approximately 50 MW of electric power as well as steam to support the paper mill's operations. Fuel for the power plant is supplied by both the paper mill and through contracts with biomass suppliers.
Electric System Reliability
The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 15.2% reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2016, through May 31, 2017. Although MISO's short-term reserve margin changes from year-to-year, fluctuations are typically less than 0.5%. The MPSC does not have minimum guidelines for future supply reserves. 
We had adequate capacity through company-owned generation units and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during 2016 and expect to have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements during 2017. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability across the 15-state MISO footprint could require us to call upon load management procedures. Load management procedures allow for the reduction of energy use through agreements with customers to directly shut off their equipment or through interruptible service, where customers agree to reduce their load in the case of an emergency interruption.

2016 Form 10-K | 7 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. For more information about the fuel rules, see Item 1. Business – D. Regulation.
Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type were as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Coal | $ | 23.09 | | | $ | 25.57 | | $ | 27.68
Natural gas combined cycle | 18.79 | | | 17.66 | | | 40.64 
Natural gas/oil peaking units | 45.08 | | | 56.99 | | | 129.83
Purchased power | 40.11 | | | 43.50 | | | 47.47 

We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs, which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation. Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded. Therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. 
We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. 
WE and WPS both have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows them to hedge up to 75% of their potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. WE and WPS also have a program that allows them to hedge up to 75% of their estimated natural gas use for electric generation in order to help manage their natural gas price risk. These hedging programs are generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. The results of all of these programs are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power. 
Coal Supply
We diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities and jointly-owned plants by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming, as well as from various other states. For 2017, approximately 76% of our total projected coal requirements of approximately 14 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.
The annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next three years are as follows:

(in thousands) | Annual Tonnage
2017 | 10,664 
2018 | 7,968 
2019 | 4,032 

Coal Deliveries
All of our 2017 coal requirements are expected to be shipped by our owned or leased unit trains under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Montana. The coal is transported by train to our rail-served electric-generating facilities and to dock storage in Superior, Wisconsin, until needed by our lake vessel-served facilities. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities.

2016 Form 10-K | 8 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Midcontinent Independent System Operator Costs
In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed and operates the MISO Energy Markets, which include its bid-based energy market and ancillary services market. We are participants in the MISO Energy Markets. For more information on MISO, see Item 1. Business – D. Regulation.
Power Purchase Commitments
We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. As of December 31, 2016, our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties for the next five years are 1,444 MW per year. This amount includes 1,033 MW per year related to a long-term power purchase agreement for electricity generated by Point Beach. 
Other Matters
Seasonality
Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. Our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, WE did not require public appeals for conservation, and it did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. In addition, WPS did not require any public appeals for conservation, and it did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs for capacity reasons. However, WPS did have service curtailments for economic interruptions. Economic interruptions are declared during times in which the price of electricity in the regional market significantly exceeds the cost of operating the company's peaking generation. During this time, interruptible customers can choose to continue using electricity at a price which exceeds the tariff rate. 
Competition
Our electric utilities face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources. Our electric utilities compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business. 
For more information on competition in our service territories, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Industry Restructuring.
Environmental Matters
For information regarding environmental matters, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies.
Natural Gas Utility Operations
For the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Wisconsin natural gas utility operations include WG's and WE's natural gas operations for all periods and WPS's natural gas operations, including in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, beginning July 1, 2015, due to the acquisition of Integrys and its subsidiaries.
Effective January 1, 2017, WPS natural gas customers and natural gas distribution assets located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were transferred to UMERC. More information about UMERC is included at the end of the Wisconsin segment section, under the heading Upper Michigan Resources Corporation.
We are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned natural gas. Together our natural gas distribution utilities are the largest in Wisconsin, and we operate throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee and surrounding areas, northeastern Wisconsin, and in large areas of both central and western Wisconsin.

(2) | Includes amounts (refunded to) collected from customers for purchased gas adjustment costs.

Natural Gas Deliveries
Our gas therm deliveries include customer-owned transported natural gas. Transported natural gas accounted for approximately 43.9% of the total volumes delivered during 2016, 41.8% during 2015, and 36.1% during 2014. Our peak daily send-out during 2016 was 23.5 million therms on January 18, 2016.
Large Natural Gas Customers
We provide natural gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include governmental, food products, education, real estate, and metals. Fuel used for WE's electric generation represents our largest transportation customer. Natural gas therms delivered to WE for electric generation represented 15.3% of total volumes delivered during each of 2016 and 2015, and 9.3% during 2014.
Natural Gas Sales Forecast
Our combined service territories in Wisconsin experienced growth in weather-normalized retail natural gas deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for electric generation) in 2016 due to positive customer growth, an improving economy, and favorable natural gas prices. We currently forecast retail natural gas delivery volumes to grow at a rate between flat and 0.5% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. The forecast projects positive customer growth being offset by energy efficiency.
Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage
We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies.

2016 Form 10-K | 10 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Pipeline Capacity and Storage
The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major natural gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, western Canada, and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. 
Due to the daily and seasonal variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 35% of forecasted winter demand; November through March is considered the winter season. Storage capacity, along with our natural gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase natural gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.
We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts.
In January 2017, we signed an agreement for the acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in Michigan that would provide approximately one-third of the storage needs for our Wisconsin natural gas utilities. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on this transaction.

We have contracts for firm supplies with terms of 3–5 months with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. 
Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our Wisconsin natural gas utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 31.2 million therms for the 2016 through 2017 heating season.
Secondary Market Transactions
Pipeline and storage capacity and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. As local distribution companies, our Wisconsin natural gas utilities must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and natural gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRMs. During 2016, we continued to participate in the secondary markets. For information on the GCRMs, see Note 1(d), Revenues and Customer Receivables.
Spot Market Natural Gas Supply
We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market.
Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices
WE and WG have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. WPS has PSCW approval to hedge up to 67% of planned winter demand using a combination of planned withdrawals from storage and NYMEX financial instruments. These approvals allow these companies to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to customers through their respective GCRMs. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company's three-year natural gas supply plan and risk management filing.

2016 Form 10-K | 11 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, WE, WG, and WPS also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward-market price differentials. These approvals provide for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to these companies' respective GCRMs.
Seasonality
Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.
Our working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.
Competition
Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced natural gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under natural gas transportation agreements, customers purchase natural gas directly from natural gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the natural gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same operating income whether we sell and transport natural gas to customers or only transport their natural gas.
Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party natural gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own natural gas supplies.
Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the natural gas industry. While the natural gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties for large commercial and industrial customers.
Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation
In December 2016, both the MPSC and the PSCW approved the operation of UMERC as a stand-alone utility in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. UMERC became operational effective January 1, 2017, and WE and WPS transferred customers and property, plant, and equipment as of that date. WE transferred approximately 27,500 retail electric customers and 50 electric distribution-only customers to UMERC, along with approximately 2,500 miles of electric distribution lines. WPS transferred approximately 9,000 retail electric customers and 5,300 natural gas customers to UMERC, along with approximately 600 miles of electric distribution lines and approximately 100 miles of natural gas distribution mains. WE and WPS also transferred related electric distribution substations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and all property rights for the distribution assets to UMERC. The estimated net book value of the property, plant, and equipment transferred to UMERC from WE and WPS as of January 1, 2017, was $83 million and $19 million, respectively. This transaction was a non-cash equity transfer between entities under common control, and therefore, did not result in a gain or loss recognized.
UMERC obtains its energy through the MISO Energy Markets and meets its market obligations through power purchase agreements with WE and WPS. The new utility has also proposed a long-term generation solution for electric reliability in the region. See Note 22, Regulatory Environment, for more information. The Tilden Mining Company will remain a customer of WE until this new generation begins commercial operation.

Illinois Segment
Our Illinois segment includes the natural gas utility operations of PGL and NSG. PGL and NSG, both Illinois corporations, began operations in 1855 and 1900, respectively. We acquired PGL and NSG as a result of the acquisition of Integrys on June 29, 2015. Our customers are located in Chicago and the northern suburbs of Chicago.

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage
We manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts, storage services, and pipeline transportation services designed to meet varying customer use patterns with safe, reliable natural gas supplies at the best value. 
Our natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed-price purchases, index-priced purchases, contracted and owned storage, peak-shaving facilities, and natural gas supply call options. We contract for fixed-term firm natural gas supply each year to meet the demand of firm system sales customers. To supplement natural gas supply and manage risk, we purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets.
For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies. 
We contract with local distribution companies and interstate pipelines to purchase firm transportation services. We believe that having multiple pipelines that serve our natural gas service territory benefits our customers by improving reliability, providing access to a diverse supply of natural gas, and fostering competition among these service providers. These benefits can lead to favorable conditions for our Illinois utilities when negotiating new agreements for transportation and storage services. Our Illinois utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of financial instruments, such as commodity futures, swaps, and options as part of their hedging programs. They hedge between 25% and 50% of natural gas purchases, with a target of 37.5%.
We own a 38.3 Bcf storage field (Manlove Field in central Illinois) and contract with various other underground storage service providers for additional storage services. Storage allows us to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand and to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year-round basis, which provides a hedge against supply cost volatility. We also own a natural gas pipeline system that connects Manlove Field to Chicago and eight major interstate pipelines. These assets are directed primarily to serving rate-regulated retail customers and are included in our regulatory rate base. We also use a portion of these company-owned storage and pipeline assets as a natural gas hub, which consists of providing transportation and storage services in interstate commerce to our wholesale customers. Customers deliver natural gas to us for storage through an injection into the storage reservoir, and we return the natural gas to the customers under an agreed schedule through a withdrawal from the storage 

2016 Form 10-K | 13 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

reservoir. Title to the natural gas does not transfer to us. We recognize service fees associated with the natural gas hub services provided to wholesale customers. These service fees reduce the cost of natural gas and services charged to retail customers in rates. 
We had adequate capacity to meet all firm natural gas demand obligations during 2016 and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all firm demand obligations during 2017. Our Illinois utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 24.4 million therms for the 2016 through 2017 heating season. 
Gas System Modernization Program 
PGL is continuing work on the SMP, a project that began in 2011 under which PGL is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. PGL currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved Qualifying Infrastructure Plant rider, which is in effect through 2023. For information on investigations related to the SMP, see Note 22, Regulatory Environment. 
Seasonality
Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.
Our Illinois utilities' working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.
Competition
Although our Illinois utilities' rates are regulated by the ICC, we still face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Absent extraordinary circumstances, potential competitors are not allowed to construct competing natural gas distribution systems in our service territory due to a judicial doctrine known as the "first in the field." In addition, we believe it would be impractical to construct competing duplicate distribution facilities due to the high cost of installation.
Since 2002, all our Illinois utilities' natural gas customers have had the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. As a result, we offer natural gas transportation service to enable customers to directly manage their energy costs. Transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from third-party natural gas suppliers and use our distribution system to transport the natural gas to their facilities. We still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.
An interstate pipeline may seek to provide transportation service directly to end users, which would bypass our natural gas transportation service. However, we have a bypass rate approved by the ICC, which allows us to negotiate rates with customers that are potential bypass candidates to help ensure that such customers use our transportation service.
Other States Segment
Our other states segment includes the natural gas utility operations of MERC and MGU. We acquired the natural gas distribution operations of MERC and MGU, located in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively, on June 29, 2015, with the acquisition of Integrys. MERC serves customers in various cities and communities throughout Minnesota, and MGU serves customers in the southern portion of lower Michigan.

We own a storage field (Partello in Michigan) and contract with various other underground storage service providers for additional storage services. Storage allows us to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand and to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year-round basis, which provides a hedge against supply cost volatility. We contract with local distribution companies and interstate pipelines to purchase firm transportation services. We believe that having multiple pipelines that serve our natural gas service territory benefits our customers by improving reliability, providing access to a diverse supply of natural gas, and fostering competition among these service providers.

Our other states utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of financial instruments, such as commodity futures, swaps, and options as part of their hedging programs. MERC hedges up to 30% of planned winter demand using NYMEX financial instruments. MGU hedges up to 20% of its planned annual purchases using NYMEX financial instruments.
Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Forecasted design peak-day throughput for our other states utilities segment is 8.7 million therms for the 2016 through 2017 heating season.

Our other states utilities' working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.
Competition
Although our other states utilities' rates are regulated by the MPUC and MSPC, we still face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. Due to the volatility of energy commodity prices, we have seen customers with dual fuel capability switch to alternative fuels for short periods of time, then switch back to natural gas as market rates change. 
MERC commercial and industrial customers and all MGU customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. We offer natural gas transportation service and also offer interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from third-party natural gas suppliers and use our distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities. We still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change.
Electric Transmission Segment
American Transmission Company 
ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including WE and WPS, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and WE and WPS are non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO. As of December 31, 2016, our ownership interest in ATC was approximately 60%. In addition, we own approximately 68% of ATC Holdco, LLC, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. As of December 31, 2016, operations were not significant. In April 2011, ATC and Duke Energy announced the creation of a joint venture, DATC, that will seek opportunities to acquire, build, own, and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America to address increasing demand for affordable, reliable transmission capacity. In April 2013, DATC acquired a 72% interest in California's Path 15 transmission line. DATC continues to evaluate new projects and opportunities, along with participating in the competitive bidding process on projects it considers viable. However, in January 2017, a subsidiary of ATC Holdco, LLC and Arizona Electric Power Cooperative entered into a joint operating agreement, ATC Southwest, to develop transmission projects in Arizona and the southwestern United States. These projects are located in the service territories of several different RTOs around the country. See Note 4, Investment in American Transmission Company, for more information.

ATC is currently named in a complaint filed with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Other Matters – American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints, for more information.
C. NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS
We Power Segment
We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, designed and built approximately 2,350 MW of generation in Wisconsin. This generation is made up of capacity from the ERGS units, ER 1 and ER 2, which were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively, and the PWGS units, PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, which were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Two unaffiliated entities collectively own approximately 17%, or approximately 211 MW, of ER 1 and ER 2. All four of 

2016 Form 10-K | 16 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

these units are being leased to WE under long-term leases (the ERGS units have 30-year leases and the PWGS units have 25-year leases), and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs.
Because of the significant investment necessary to construct these generating units, we constructed the plants under Wisconsin's Leased Generation Law, which allows a non-utility affiliate to construct an electric generating facility and lease it to the public utility. The law allows a public utility that has entered into a lease approved by the PSCW to recover fully in its retail electric rates that portion of any payments under the lease that the PSCW has allocated to the public utility's Wisconsin retail electric service, and all other costs that are prudently incurred in the public utility's operation and maintenance of the electric generating facility allocated to the utility's Wisconsin retail electric service. In addition, the PSCW may not modify or terminate a lease it has approved under the Leased Generation Law except as specifically provided in the lease or the PSCW's order approving the lease. This law effectively created regulatory certainty in light of the significant investment being made to construct the units. All four units were constructed under leases approved by the PSCW.

We are recovering our costs of these units, including subsequent capital additions, through lease payments that are billed from We Power to WE and then recovered in WE's rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC, and the FERC. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% ROE and the equity ratio is assumed to be 55% for the ERGS units and 53% for the PWGS units. 
Corporate and Other Segment
The corporate and other segment includes the operations of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, and the PELLC holding company, as well as the operations of Wispark, Bostco, Wisvest (prior to the sale of these assets in the first quarter of 2016), WECC, WBS, PDL, and ITF (prior to the sale of this business in the first quarter of 2016). See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information on the sale of Wisvest's assets and ITF. 
Bostco and Wispark develop and invest in real estate, and combined they had $69.0 million in real estate holdings at December 31, 2016. Wispark has developed several business parks and other commercial real estate projects, primarily in southeastern Wisconsin. 
Wisvest was originally formed to develop, own, and operate electric generating facilities and to invest in other energy-related entities. However, Wisvest discontinued its development activity several years ago. In April 2016, we sold the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest, which provided chilled water services to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center. See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information. Wisvest no longer has significant operations.
WECC was originally formed to invest in non-utility projects, such as low income housing developments. However, due to a focus on our regulated utility business, WECC sold many of its non-utility investments and no longer has significant operations.
WBS is a wholly owned centralized service company that provides administrative and general support services to our regulated utilities. WBS also provides certain administrative and support services to our nonregulated entities. 
PDL owns distributed renewable solar projects. During 2016, PDL sold its natural gas-fired cogeneration facility and its landfill gas facility. These facilities were not significant to our operations. PDL's solar facilities rely on solar irradiance, a renewable energy resource. There is no market price risk associated with the fuel supply of these solar projects. However, production at these facilities can be intermittent due to the variability of solar irradiance.
D. REGULATION
We are a holding company and are subject to the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005). We also have various subsidiaries that meet the definition of a holding company under PUHCA 2005 and are also subject to its requirements.
Pursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. We report to the PSCW annually our compliance with this law and provide supporting documentation to show that our non-utility assets are below the non-utility asset cap.

2016 Form 10-K | 17 | WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Regulated Utility Operations
In addition to the specific regulations noted above and below, our utilities are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, the MDEQ, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. 
Rates
Our utilities' rates were regulated by the various commissions shown in the table below as of December 31, 2016. These commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions.

* | Effective January 1, 2017, all of WE's and WPS's electric and natural gas distribution assets and customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were transferred to UMERC, with the exception of the Tilden Mining Company which will continue to be a customer of WE. See Item 1. Business – B. Utility Energy Operations – Wisconsin Segment – Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation and Note 22, Regulatory Environment, for additional information.

Embedded within WE's and WPS’s electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require a utility to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of the utility's symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of the utility's approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. The deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If the utility's ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which the utility's return exceeds the authorized amount. 
Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our Wisconsin wholesale electric customers. Our natural gas utilities operate under GCRMs as approved by their respective state regulator. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 
For a summary of the significant mechanisms our utility subsidiaries had in place in 2016 that allowed them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts, see Note 1(d), Revenues and Customer Receivables. 
In May 2015, the PSCW approved the acquisition of Integrys on the condition that WE and WG each be subject to an earnings sharing mechanism for three years beginning January 1, 2016. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on these earnings sharing mechanisms.

Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets
In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO enhanced the energy market by including an ancillary services market. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint, and has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.
In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint.
As part of MISO, a market-based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2016, through May 31, 2017. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.
Beginning June 1, 2013, MISO instituted an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources could be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. Our capacity requirements during 2016 were fulfilled using our own capacity resources.

Other Electric Regulations
WE and WPS are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.
As of December 31, 2016, WPS and WE were subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin and Public Acts 295 and 342 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information. Due to the transfer of WPS's electric and natural gas distribution assets and customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC on January 1, 2017, WPS is no longer subject to Public Acts 295 and 342 in Michigan. WE will continue to be subject to the Michigan Acts, along with UMERC, as long as the Tilden Mining Company remains a customer of WE. See Item 1. Business – B. Utility Energy Operations – Wisconsin Segment – Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation and Note 22, Regulatory Environment, for additional information on the formation of UMERC.
All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations.
Other Natural Gas Regulations
Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services, including PGL's natural gas hub, are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the state commissions are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas utilities' safety compliance programs for our pipelines under the United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline).
We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territories. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to low-income customers of the utilities.
Non-Utility Operations
The generation facilities constructed by wholly owned subsidiaries of We Power are being leased on a long-term basis to WE. Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, WE. We Power received determinations from the FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to WE, We Power's subsidiaries would not be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus would not be subject to the FERC's jurisdiction. 
E. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.
Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Requirements. For a discussion of matters related to manufactured gas plant sites and air and water quality, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies.
