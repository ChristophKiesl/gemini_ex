  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006 under the name “Mountain West Business Solutions, Inc.” Until October 2009, our business was to provide management consulting services to small and home-office based companies.
  
 In October 2009, we acquired Sunshine Biopharma, Inc., a Colorado corporation holding an exclusive license (the “License”) to a new anticancer drug bearing the laboratory name, Adva-27a. As a result of this transaction we changed our name to “Sunshine Biopharma, Inc.” and our officers and directors resigned their positions with us and were replaced by Sunshine Biopharma, Inc.’s management at the time, including our current CEO, Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, and our current CFO, Camille Sebaaly each of whom remain part of our current management. Our principal business became that of a pharmaceutical company focusing on the development of our licensed Adva-27a anticancer compound. In December 2015 we acquired all issued and pending patents pertaining to our Adva-27a technology and terminated the License.
  
 In October 2012, we published the results of our initial preclinical studies of Adva-27a in the peer-reviewed journal, ANTICANCER RESEARCH. The preclinical studies were conducted in collaboration with Binghamton University, a State University of New York. The publication is entitled “Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells” [ANTICANCER RESEARCH Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432 (2012)].
  
 In July 2014, we formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), for the purposes of offering generic pharmaceutical products in Canada and elsewhere around the world. In April and June 2016 Sunshine Canada signed licensing agreements for four (4) generic prescription drugs for the treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer and BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).
  
 In January 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Atlas Pharma Inc. (“Atlas”), a Health Canada certified company dedicated to chemical analysis of pharmaceutical and other industrial samples. Effective April 1, 2019, we re-assigned all of our stock in Atlas back to the original owner in exchange for the Atlas related debt. See “Discontinued Analytical Chemistry Services Operations” below for a more detailed explanation of this acquisition and the subsequent disposition thereof in April 2019.
  
 In March 2018, we formed NOX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned Colorado corporation, and assigned all of our interest in our Adva-27a anticancer compound to that company. NOX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s mission is to research, develop and commercialize proprietary drugs including Adva-27a.
  
 In December 2018, we completed the development of a new nutritional supplement which we trademarked Essential 9™. This new supplement is an over-the-counter tablet comprised of the nine amino acids which the human body cannot make. Essential 9™ has been authorized for marketing by Health Canada under NPN 80089663. On March 12, 2019, Essential 9™ became available for sale on Amazon.ca and shortly thereafter on Amazon.com.

 Effective February 1, 2019, we completed a 20 to 1 reverse split of our $0.001 par value Common Stock reducing the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock from 1,713,046,242 to 85,652,400 (the “First Reverse Stock Split”). The number of authorized shares of our $0.001 par value Common Stock remained at 3,000,000,000 shares.
  
 In November 2019, we received Health Canada approval for a new Calcium-Vitamin D supplement. Health Canada issued NPN 80093432 through which it authorized us to manufacture and sell the new Calcium-Vitamin D supplement under the brand name Essential Calcium-Vitamin Dtm.
  
 Our principal place of business is located at 6500 Trans-Canada Highway, 4th Floor, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada H9R 0A5. Our phone number is (514) 426-6161 and our website address is www.sunshinebiopharma.com.

  2020 Events
  
 Effective April 6, 2020, we completed another 20 to 1 reverse split of our $0.001 par value Common Stock, reducing the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock from 1,193,501,925 to 59,675,417 (the “Second Reverse Stock Split”). The authorized capital of our Common Stock remained as previously established at 3,000,000,000 shares. Except in the paragraphs describing the reverse stock splits, all references in this Report to our Common Stock as well as the price per share of Common Stock are presented on a post First and Second Reverse Stock Splits basis.
  
 On May 22, 2020, we filed a patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections, including COVID-19. Our patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the main Coronavirus protease (Mpro), an enzyme that is essential for viral replication. The small molecules covered by the patent application were computer modelled and designed by Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, our CEO. The patent application has a priority date of May 22, 2020.
  
 On June 17, 2020, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State for the State of Colorado, to eliminate the Series “A” Preferred Shares consisting of Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand (850,000) shares, par value $0.10 per share, and the designation thereof, such shares to be returned to the status of undesignated shares of Preferred Stock. In addition, the Amendment increased the number of authorized Series “B” Preferred Shares from Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) to One Million (1,000,000) shares.
  
 Also on June 17, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of our Series “B” Preferred Stock in favor of Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, our CEO and a director, in consideration for his development of a new treatment for Coronavirus infections, including COVID-19. The Series “B” Preferred Stock is non-convertible, non-redeemable, non-retractable and has a superior liquidation value of $0.10 per share. Each share of Series “B” Preferred Stock is entitled to 1,000 votes per share. This issuance brought the total number of Series “B” Preferred Stock held by Dr. Slilaty to 1,000,000 shares.
  
 On September 8, 2020, we executed a financing agreement with RB Capital Partners, Inc., La Jolla, CA, who has agreed to provide us with a minimum of $2 million in convertible debt financing over the next three to six months pursuant to the terms and conditions included in relevant Promissory Notes (the “Promissory Notes”). The Promissory Notes bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and are fully convertible into shares of shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price equal to the market value of our Common Stock on the applicable conversion date or $0.30 per share, whichever is greater. The Promissory Notes have a maturity date of two years from the date of issuance and must be fully converted on or before the maturity date. We have the right under these Promissory Notes to pay off all or any part of the Promissory Notes at any time without penalty. As of the date of this Report, we have received a total of $2,050,000 in funding under this agreement.
  
 Effective October 6, 2020, we entered into a Research Agreement (the “Agreement”) with the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. (“UGARF”), representing the University of Georgia (“UGA”). The purpose of the Agreement is to memorialize the terms of our working together with UGA to conduct the necessary research and development to advance our Anti-Coronavirus lead compound, SBFM-PL4 (or derivatives thereof) through various stages of preclinical development, animal studies and clinical trials for Coronavirus infections. The Agreement grants us an exclusive worldwide license for all of the intellectual property developed by UGA, whether alone or jointly with us.

  SBFM-PL4 Anti-Coronavirus Treatment
  
 Viruses carry minimal genetic information as they rely, for the most part, on host cellular machinery to multiply. Coronavirus has a positive-sense RNA genome consisting of approximately 30,000 nucleotides, a genome size that places it among the larger sized viruses. A positive-sense RNA genome is effectively a messenger RNA which allows the virus to express its genes immediately upon gaining entry into the host cell without the need for any prior replication or transcription steps as is the case with negative-sense RNA or DNA viruses. This is part of what makes Coronavirus a highly aggressive pathogen. Many of the causative agents of serious human diseases are positive-sense RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C, Zeka, Polio, West Nile, Dengue, Cardiovirus, and many others. Some positive-sense RNA viruses, such as the rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, are less clinically serious but they are responsible for widespread morbidity on a yearly basis.
  
 The initial genome expression products of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, are two large polyproteins, referred to as pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins are cleaved at 15 specific sites by two virus encoded proteases (Mpro and PLpro) to generate 16 different non-structural proteins essential for viral replication. Mpro and PLpro represent an attractive anti-viral drug development targets as they play a central role in the early stages of viral replication. The crystal structure of Mpro shows the presence of an active site Cysteine (Cys145) and a coordinated active site Histidine (His41), both of which are essential for the enzyme’s proteolytic activity. Similarly, PLpro, also a Cysteine Protease, has an active site Cysteine at position 112 and a Histidine at 273. The following is a summary of the development to date of our Coronavirus Treatment project:
  
  ●
  On May 22, 2020, we filed a patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections. Our patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the Coronavirus main protease (Mpro), an enzyme that is essential for viral replication. The small molecules covered by the patent application were computer modelled and designed by Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, our CEO. The patent application has a priority date of May 22, 2020.

 
  ●
  In August 2020, we completed the synthesis of four different potential inhibitors of Coronavirus protease. These compounds are based on the technology described in our patent application filed on May 22, 2020.

 
  ●
  In September 2020, we completed the screening of our four compounds and subsequently identified a lead Anti-Coronavirus drug candidate (SBFM-PL4). The screening which pinpointed the lead compound was performed at the University of Georgia, College of Pharmacy under the leadership of Dr. Scott D. Pegan, Director of the Center for Drug Discovery and Interim Associate Head of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences.

 
  ●
  In October 2020, we expanded our collaboration with Dr. Scott Pegan group by entering into a research agreement with the University of Georgia to further develop our Anti-Coronavirus lead compound, SBFM-PL4. We will proceed by conducting the in vitro studies followed by cell culture assays and assessment in Coronavirus infected mice before entering human clinical trials.

 
  ●
  On February 1, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Georgia for two Anti-Coronavirus compounds which the University of Georgia had previously developed and patented. We are currently advancing the development of these two compounds in parallel with our SBFM-PL4 by conducting a transgenic mice study in collaboration with the University of Georgia. The mice being used in the study have been genetically engineered to express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transmembrane protein in their lungs making them susceptible to lethal infection by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The SARSCoV-2 virus uses the hACE2 receptor to gain entry into human cells to replicate. The goal of the study is to determine if our protease inhibitors will protect the hACE2-transgenic mice from disease progression and death following infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Should these mice studies prove successful, we plan to submit the results to the FDA for authorization to conduct testing on actual COVID-19 patient volunteers in a Phase I clinical trial setting. The implications of a COVID-19 treatment becoming available are vast. This is particularly the case in view of the fact that some of the variants emerging around the world are more virulent and may escape neutralization by the current vaccines.

 
  Adva-27a Anticancer Drug
  
 Since inception, our proprietary drug development activities has focused on the development of a small molecule called Adva-27a for the treatment of aggressive forms of cancer. A Topoisomerase II inhibitor, Adva-27a has been shown to be effective at destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells including Pancreatic Cancer cells, Breast Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells and Uterine Sarcoma cells (Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012). Sunshine Biopharma is direct owner of all issued and pending worldwide patents pertaining to Adva-27a including U.S. Patents Number 8,236,935 and 10,272,065.

 Adva-27a is a GEM-difluorinated C-glycoside derivative of Podophyllotoxin (see Figure 1). Another derivative of Podophyllotoxin called Etoposide is currently on the market and is used to treat various types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, testicular cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and several other forms of cancer. Etoposide is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs. Adva-27a and Etoposide are similar in that they both attack the same target in cancer cells, namely the DNA unwinding enzyme, Topoisomerase II. Unlike Etoposide however, Adva-27a is able to penetrate and destroy Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells. Adva-27a is the only compound known today that is capable of destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer. In addition, Adva-27a has been shown to have distinct and more desirable biological and pharmacological properties compared to Etoposide. In side-by-side studies using Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer cells and Etoposide as a reference, Adva-27a showed markedly greater cell killing activity (see Figure 2).
Figure 2
  
 Our preclinical studies to date have shown that:
  
  ●
  Adva-27a is effective at killing different types of Multidrug Resistant cancer cells, including Pancreatic Cancer Cells (Panc-1), Breast Cancer Cells (MCF-7/MDR), Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells (H69AR), and Uterine Sarcoma Cells (MES-SA/Dx5).

 
  ●
  Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies and pharmacokinetics data in rats.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase II with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar (this number has recently been reduce to 1.44 micromolar as a result of resolving the two isomeric forms of Adva-27a).

 
  ●
  Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats.

 
  ●
  Adva-27a does not inhibit tubulin assembly.

 These and other preclinical data have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, a peer-reviewed International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment. The publication which is entitled “Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells” [ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32: 4423-4432 (2012)] is available on our website at www.sunshinebiopharma.com.
  
 We have been delayed in our clinical development program due to lack of funding. Our fund raising efforts are continuing and as soon as adequate financing is in place we will continue our clinical development program of Adva-27a by conducting the following next sequence of steps:
  
  ●
  GMP Manufacturing of 2 kilogram for use in IND-Enabling Studies and Phase I Clinical Trials

 
  ●
  IND-Enabling Studies

 
  ●
  Regulatory Filing (Fast-Track Status Anticipated)

 
  ●
  Phase I Clinical Trials (Pancreatic Cancer Indication)

 
 Adva-27a’s initial indication will be Pancreatic Cancer for which there are currently little or no treatment options available. We are planning to conduct our clinical trials at McGill University’s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada. All aspects of the clinical trials in Canada will employ FDA standards at all levels.
  
 According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. While particularly effective against Multidrug Resistant Cancer, we believe Adva-27a can potentially treat all cancer types, particularly those in which Topoisomerase II has been amplified. We believe that upon successful completion of Phase I Clinical Trials we may receive one or more offers from large pharmaceutical companies to buyout or license our drug. However, there are no assurances that our Phase I Trials will be successful, or if successful, that any pharmaceutical companies will make an acceptable offer to us. In the event we do not consummate such a transaction, we will require significant capital in order to manufacture and market our new drug on our own. The following, Figure 3, is a space-filling molecular model of our Adva-27a.

  Generic Pharmaceuticals Operations
  
 In 2016, our Canadian wholly owned subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), signed Licensing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four prescription generic drugs for the treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. We have since been working towards commencement of marketing of these pharmaceutical products under our own, Sunshine Biopharma, label. These four generic products are as follows:
  
  ●
  Anastrozole (brand name Arimidex® by AstraZeneca) for treatment of Breast Cancer;

 
  ●
  Letrozole (brand name Femara® by Novartis) for treatment of Breast Cancer;

 
  ●
  Bicalutamide (brand name Casodex® by AstraZeneca) for treatment of Prostate Cancer;

 
  ●
  Finasteride (brand name Propecia® by Merck) for treatment of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)

 
 Sunshine Canada is currently in the process of securing a Drug Identification Number (“DIN”) for each of these products from Health Canada. We are also required to obtain a Drug Establishment License (“DEL”) from Health Canada. Upon receipt of the DEL and DIN’s, we will be able to accept orders for our own label SBI-Anastrozole, SBI-Letrozole, SBI-Bicalutamide and SBI-Finasteride. We cannot estimate the timing for our obtaining either the DIN’s or the DEL due to variables involved that are out of our control. Figure 4 shows our 30-Pill blister pack of Anastrozole.
  
 
 Figure 4
  
 We currently have a number of additional Generic Pharmaceuticals under review for in-licensing. While no assurances can be provided that we will acquire the rights to any additional generic drugs, we believe that a larger product portfolio will provide us with more opportunities and a greater reach into the marketplace.
  
 Various publicly available sources indicate that the worldwide sales of generic pharmaceuticals are over $500 billion per year. In the United States and Canada, the sales of generic pharmaceuticals are approximately $115 billion and $5 billion, respectively. The generic pharmaceuticals business is fairly competitive and there are several multinational players in the field including Teva (Israel), Novartis - Sandoz (Switzerland), Hospira (USA), Mylan (Netherlands), Sanofi (France), Fresenius Kabi (Germany) and Apotex (Canada). While no assurances can be provided, with our offering of Canadian approved products we believe that we will be able to access a small percentage of the generic pharmaceutical marketplace.

  Nutritional Supplements Operations
  
 In December 2018, we completed the development of Essential 9tm, the first in a line of essential micronutrients products that we are planning to launch. On December 14, 2018, Health Canada issued NPN 80089663 through which it authorized Sunshine Biopharma Inc. to manufacture and sell the Essential 9tm product. Our Essential 9tm nutritional supplement tablets contain a balanced formula of the 9 Essential Amino Acids that the human body cannot make. Essential Amino Acids are 9 out of the 20 amino acids required for protein synthesis. Proteins are involved in all body functions – From the musculature and immune system to hormones and neurotransmitters. Like vitamins, Essential Amino Acids cannot be made by the human body and must be obtained through diet. Deficiency in one or more of the 9 Essential Amino Acids can lead to loss of muscle mass, fatigue, weight gain and reduced ability to build muscle mass in athletes. Sunshine Biopharma’s Essential 9tm provides all 9 Essential Amino Acids in freeform and in the proportions recommended by Health Canada. Essential 9tm is currently available on Amazon.com and Amazon.ca. Figure 5 below shows our 60-Tablet Essential 9tm product.
Figure 5
  
 In November 2019, we received Health Canada approval for another nutritional supplement, a new Calcium-Vitamin D tablets. Health Canada issued NPN 80093432 through which it authorized us to manufacture and sell the new Calcium-Vitamin D supplement under the brand name Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™.
  
 Vitamin D is a group of steroid-like molecules responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. They are also involved in multiple other biological functions, including proper functioning of the immune system, promoting healthy growth of bone, and reduction of inflammation. The most important compounds in this group are Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Sunshine Biopharma’s Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™ tablets contain both of these compounds as well as Calcium for optimum health benefits. We anticipate that Essential Calcium-Vitamin D™ will be available on Amazon.ca in early 2021.

  Discontinued Analytical Chemistry Services Operations
  
 On January 1, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Atlas Pharma Inc. (“Atlas”), a privately held Canadian company providing analytical chemistry testing services (“Atlas Business”). The purchase price for the shares was $848,000 Canadian ($676,748 US). The purchase price included cash payment of $100,500 Canadian ($80,289 US), plus the issuance of 50,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock valued at $238,000, and a promissory note in the principal amount of $450,000 Canadian ($358,407 US), with interest payable at the rate of 3% per annum (“Atlas Note”).
  
 Effective April 1, 2019, we disposed of Atlas by re-assigning all of our stock in Atlas back to the original owner in exchange for the Atlas Note. As a consequence of the sale, the operating results and the assets and liabilities of the discontinued Atlas Business are presented separately in the Company's financial statements as Discontinued Operations. In additions, prior period balances have been reclassified to present the operations of the Atlas Business as Discontinued Operations.
  
  Intellectual Property: Licenses/Patents/Trademarks/Tradenames
  
 We are the exclusive owner of all worldwide rights pertaining to Adva-27a covered by PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029.  The patent applications filed under PCT/FR2007/000697 have been issued in Europe, Canada, the United States (US Patent Number 8,236,935) and India.  The patent application filed in the U.S. under PCT/CA2014/000029 has recently been issued (US Patent Number 10,272,065). The remaining international patent applications filed under the same PCT are still pending.
  
 In 2016 we signed Licensing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four (4) prescription generic drugs for the treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. These agreements give us the right to register the four (4) generic products, Anastrozole, Letrozole, Bicalutamide and Finasteride in Canada under our own label and obtain a DIN for each in order to be able to place them on the market.
  
 In 2018 we completed the development of Essential 9tm, our first nutritional supplement. On December 14, 2018, Health Canada issued NPN 80089663 through which it authorized Sunshine Biopharma Inc. to manufacture and sell the Essential 9tm product. We are currently preparing the necessary documents for registration of our Essential 9tm trademark in the United States.
  
 In November 2019, we received Health Canada approval for another nutritional supplement, a new Calcium-Vitamin D tablets. Health Canada issued NPN 80093432 through which it authorized us to manufacture and sell the new Calcium-Vitamin D supplement under the brand name Essential Calcium-Vitamin Dtm.
  
 On May 22, 2020, we filed a patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections, including COVID-19. The patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the main Coronavirus protease (Mpro), an enzyme that is essential for viral replication. The United States Patent and Trademark Office publishes patent applications twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months from the date of filing.
  
 On February 1, 2021, we entered an exclusive license agreement with the University of Georgia for two Anti-Coronavirus compounds which the University of Georgia had previously developed and patented. In collaboration with the University of Georgia, we are currently advancing the development of these two compounds in parallel with our own SBFM-PL4 compound.
 
  Government Regulations
  
 All of our business operations, including the Proprietary Drug Development Operations, the Generic Pharmaceutical Operations, and Nutritional Supplements Operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.
  
 In the U.S, the Federal Government agency responsible for regulating drugs and nutritional supplements is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Canadian counterpart to the FDA is Health Canada. Both the FDA and Health Canada have similar requirements for drugs and supplements to be approved for marketing. In Canada, drugs and nutritional supplements are authorized through the issuance by Health Canada of a Drug Identification Number (DIN) and a Natural Product Number (NPN) on a per product basis, respectively. In both the U.S. and Canada, the quality standards for brand name drugs and generic drugs are the same. In addition, the ingredients, manufacturing processes and facilities for all drugs and supplements must meet the guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). Moreover, all drug manufacturers must perform a series of tests, both during and after production, to show that every drug batch made meets the regulatory requirements for that product.
  
 In connection with our development of the Anti-Coronavirus treatment, SBFM-PL4, and the Anti-Cancer compound, Adva-27a, we will be subject to significant regulations in the U.S. in order to obtain approval of the FDA to offer our product on the market.  The approximate procedure for obtaining FDA approval involves an initial filing of an IND application following which the FDA would review and give the go ahead for the drug developer to proceed with Phase I clinical (human) trials.  Following completion of Phase I, the results are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase II.  Similarly, following completion of Phase II the data are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase III.  Following completion of Phase III, a request is made for marketing approval.  Depending on various issues and considerations, the FDA could provide limited marketing approval for “compassionate-use” if the drug treats terminally ill patients with limited other treatment options available.  As of the date of this Report we have not made any filings with the FDA or other regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions.  We have however had discussions with clinicians and as a result we believe that Health Canada is likely to grant us a so-called “fast-track” process on the basis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the terminal nature of the cancer type we are planning to treat.  There are no assurances this will occur.

  Employees 
 
 As of the date of this Report we have three (3) employees, comprised of our management team. Presently, most of our development and marketing activities are subcontracted out to specialized service providers. As our business activities expand, we anticipate that we will need additional employees in the areas of accounting, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales and laboratory personnel.
 Competition
  
 Our Anti-Coronavirus drug development project is in direct competition with over 34 companies working on vaccine or treatment options for COVID-19. Among the companies working on vaccines are Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Sanofi. The companies focused on treatments include AbbVie, Amgen, Bayer, Biogen, Gilead, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Regeneron, Roche, and Takeda. As of December 31, 2020, two (2) vaccines (Pfizer’s and Moderna’s) and three (3) treatments (Regeneron’s, Eli Lilly’s, and Gilead’s) have been approved by the FDA for emergency use. While these vaccines and treatment options are effective, we believe that additional, more convenient treatment options continue to be essential as gaps, lapses, and hospital admissions will likely persist. A treatment such as the one we are developing which can be taken orally at home, will form an important complement for vaccination and the current treatments which must be administered intravenously.
  
 In the area of proprietary anticancer drug development, we are competing with large publicly and privately held companies engaged in developing new cancer therapies. There are numerous other entities engaged in this business that have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.  Nearly all major pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Amgen, Roche, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis, to name a few, have on-going anticancer drug development programs and some of the drugs they may develop could be in direct competition with our own.  Also, a number of small companies are also working in the area of cancer therapy and could develop drugs that may be in competition with ours.  However, none of these competitor companies can use molecules similar to ours as they would be infringing our patents.
  
 The generic pharmaceuticals business is fairly competitive and there are many players in the field including several multinationals such as Teva (Israel), Novartis - Sandoz (Switzerland), Hospira (USA), Mylan (Netherlands), Sanofi (France), Fresenius Kabi (Germany) and Apotex (Canada) with annual sales in the range of approximately $2 billion to over $10 billion. With our offering of Canadian approved generic products, we believe that we will be able to access a small percentage of the generic pharmaceuticals market.
  
 Similarly, our Essential 9tm and Essential Calcium-Vitamin Dtm together with our other planned line of nutritional supplement products fall directly within a very crowded and highly competitive product sector. As of the date of this Report we believe, Essential 9tm is the only Essential Amino Acid product that comprises all 9 essential amino acids in tablet form. We also believe this may provide us with a competitive advantage, at least for the near future but there are no assurances that this will occur.
