Item 1.   Business
 
Friedman Industries, Incorporated (the “Company”), a Texas corporation incorporated in 1965, is engaged in steel processing, pipe manufacturing and processing and steel and pipe distribution. 
 
The Company has two product groups: coil and tubular products. Significant financial information relating to the Company’s product groups for the last two years is contained in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, which financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in Item 8 hereof. 
 
Coil Products 
 
The Company purchases prime hot-rolled steel coils, processes the coils into flat, finished sheet and plate and sells these products on a wholesale, rapid-delivery basis in competition with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. 
 
The Company owns and operates two coil processing facilities located in Hickman, Arkansas (“Hickman”) and Decatur, Alabama (“Decatur”). Each facility operates a cut-to-length line and a steel temper mill. The cut-to-length lines are designed to level the steel and cut the material to prescribed lengths. The steel temper mills are designed to improve the flatness of the steel and its surface qualities. The Company’s processing machinery is heavy, mill-type equipment capable of processing coils weighing up to 25 tons. Coils are processed to the specifications required for a particular order. Shipments are made via unaffiliated truckers or by rail. 
 
The Hickman and Decatur facilities are functionally equivalent with respect to machinery, equipment, capacities and products produced. The Company makes shipments of coil products based on which facility offers the desired product or, if the product is available at both facilities, based on other factors, such as customer location, freight conditions and the ability of the facility to fulfill the order on a timely basis. 
 
The Company also purchases and markets non-standard hot-rolled steel coils through its XSCP Division (“XSCP”). XSCP routinely processes non-standard coils into flat, finished sheet and plate. XSCP operates from the Company’s Hickman and Decatur coil processing facilities and shares certain expenses and employees with Hickman and Decatur. In addition, Hickman and Decatur provide warehousing, processing and distribution services to XSCP. 
 
The Hickman and Decatur processing facilities are located in close proximity to steel mills operated by Nucor Steel Company (“NSC”). The Company purchases a significant amount of its hot-rolled steel coils from these NSC mills. Loss of NSC as a source of coil supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. 
 
The Company also processes customer-owned coils on a fee basis. Revenues generated from processing customer-owned coils are not material to the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Tubular Products 
 
Through its Texas Tubular Products Division (“TTP”) in Lone Star, Texas, the Company manufactures, purchases, processes and markets tubular products (“pipe”). 
 
TTP operates two Electric Resistance Welded (“ERW”) pipe mills. Both pipe mill #1 and pipe mill #2 are American Petroleum Institute (“API”) licensed to manufacture line and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. Pipe mill #1 focuses on producing ERW pipe with outside diameters (“OD”) of 6 5/8” and 8 5/8”. Pipe mill #2 is capable of producing ERW pipe with OD ranging from 2 3/8” to 5 9/16” with the majority of production focusing on OD of 4 1/2”, 5 1/2” and 5 9/16”. TTP also employs various pipe processing equipment, including beveling machines, pipe handling equipment and other related machinery.
 
Subsequent to fiscal year-end, in May 2017, TTP placed into service its newly constructed pipe-finishing facility. The facility threads and couples oil country tubular goods (“OCTG”) and performs other processing and testing services that are customary in the OCTG finishing process. The facility focuses on threading semi-premium connections but is also licensed to thread API connections.

U.S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. (“USS”) has been the primary supplier of new mill reject pipe to the Company and a significant customer of the Company’s manufactured tubular products used in the energy business. Historically, the Company’s manufactured tubular products sold to USS were produced from coil material purchased from USS. Sales of tubular products to USS have declined in recent years and in fiscal 2017 no sales were recorded to USS. Management believes the downward trend is a direct impact of the increased presence of low-priced imported material and a recent recession in the U.S. energy business. The Company is unable to provide an estimate of the timing or quantity of future pipe orders from USS. In March 2016, USS announced it was temporarily idling pipe production at its Lone Star Tubular Operations facility due to weak market conditions. In December 2016, USS announced plans to permanently idle its #1 welded pipe mill at the Lone Star facility. In May 2017, USS resumed production at its Lone Star facility’s #2 welded pipe mill. The Company expects the volume and size range of new mill reject pipe supply from USS to be reduced given the permanent idling of the Lone Star facility’s #1 pipe mill. The Company continues to manufacture pipe for sale to customers other than USS and sources coil material for this pipe production from domestic steel mills other than USS. Accordingly, the Company does not believe the idling of any USS facility will impact the ability of the Company to receive adequate coil supply for pipe manufacturing demands. Loss of USS as a supplier or customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company can make no assurances as to orders from USS or the amounts of pipe and coil material that will be available from USS in the future.
 
Marketing 
 
The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of total sales contributed by each group of products and services during each of the Company’s last two fiscal years: 

Product and Service Groups | 2017 | | | 2016
---------------------------+------+----+---+-----
Coil Products | | 83 | % | | 81 | %
Tubular Products | | 17 | % | | 19 | %

 
Coil Products.  The Company sells coil products and processing services to approximately 150 customers located primarily in the midwestern, southwestern and southeastern regions of the United States. The Company’s principal customers for these products and services are steel distributors and customers fabricating steel products such as storage tanks and containers, steel buildings, construction equipment, transportation equipment, and other similar products. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, sales of coil products to Trinity Industries, Inc. accounted for approximately 28% and 35% of the Company’s total sales, respectively. 
 
The Company sells substantially all of its coil products through its own sales force. At March 31, 2017, the sales force was comprised of the Vice President – Coil Sales and two professional sales personnel under the direction of the Senior Vice President — Sales and Marketing. Sales personnel are paid on a salary and commission basis. 
 
Tubular Products.  The Company sells its tubular products nationally to approximately 110 customers. The Company’s principal customers for these products are steel and pipe distributors. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, no individual tubular customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total sales.
 
The Company sells substantially all of its tubular products through its own sales force comprised of the Vice President – Tubular Sales and two professional sales personnel under the direction of the Senior Vice President — Sales and Marketing. Sales personnel are paid on a salary and commission basis. 
 
Competition 
 
The Company is engaged in a non-seasonal, highly-competitive business. The Company competes with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. The steel industry, in general, is characterized by a small number of extremely large companies dominating the bulk of the market and a large number of relatively small companies, such as the Company, competing for a limited share of such market. 
 

The Company believes that, generally, its ability to compete is dependent upon its ability to offer products at prices competitive with or below those of other steel suppliers, as well as its ability to provide products meeting customer specifications on a rapid-delivery basis. 
 
Employees 
 
At March 31, 2017, the Company had 80 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees.
