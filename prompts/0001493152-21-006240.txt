ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

Overview
 
Sylios Corp (f/k/a US Natural Gas Corp) (“Sylios”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was organized as a Florida Corporation on March 28, 2008 under the name of Adventure Energy, Inc.
 
Sylios Corp is a holding corporation, which through its subsidiaries, has operations engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, purchase of royalty and working interest units in producing properties (oil and natural gas) and alternative land development projects. The Company maintains equity investments in our two spin-offs (The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. (“GCAN”) and AMDAQ Corp (“AMDAQ”)) that focus on the development and commercialization of cannabinoid delivery systems and blockchain technology, respectively. As of the date of this filing, the Company maintains a 1.81% ownership of the issued and outstanding common shares of GCAN and a 9.84% ownership of the issued and outstanding common shares of AMDAQ.
 
Our operations are currently divided amongst five wholly owned subsidiaries, US Natural Gas Corp KY (“KY”), US Natural Gas Corp WV (“WV”) (formerly Wilon Resources, Inc.), E 3 Petroleum Corp (“E3”), 1720 RCMG, LLC (“RCMG”) and 5496 NRMF, LLC (“NRMF”). During the fiscal year ended 2017, the Company spun-off its two formerly owned subsidiaries, The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. and AMDAQ Corp. In addition, in June 2017 the Company sold its wholly owned subsidiary Bud Bank, Inc.
 
Subsidiaries
 
US Natural Gas Corp WV:
 
US Natural Gas Corp WV (“WV”) (formerly Wilon Resources, Inc.) is a wholly owned subsidiary that was formed in Tennessee and acquired in June 2010.
 
WV’s operations were based in Wayne County, West Virginia and primarily concentrated on the production of commercially viable natural gas. Through WV, the Company seeks to identify and acquire “non-operator” royalty or working interest participations in natural gas wells that are in production. As of the date of this filing, the Company does not own any real property, royalty or working interest participations in WV.
 
US Natural Gas Corp KY:
 
US Natural Gas Corp KY (“KY”) is a wholly owned subsidiary formed in the State of Florida on June 8, 2010. KY’s operations concentrate on oil producing activities mainly in South-Central Kentucky.
 
Our business strategy is to economically increase reserves, production, and the sale of natural gas and oil from existing and acquired properties in the Appalachian Basin and elsewhere, in order to maximize shareholders’ return over the long term. Our strategic location in Kentucky enables us to actively pursue the acquisition and development of producing properties in that area that will enhance our revenue base without proportional increases in overhead costs.
 
We expect to generate long-term reserve and production growth through drilling activities and further acquisitions. We believe that our management’s experience and expertise will enable us to identify, evaluate, and develop natural gas projects.
 
We have acquired and intend to acquire additional producing oil and gas property rights where we believe significant additional value can be created. Our Management is primarily interested in developmental properties where some combination of these factors exist: (1) opportunities for long production life with stable production levels; (2) geological formations with multiple producing horizons; (3) substantial exploitation potential; and (4) relatively low capital investment production costs.

Competition
 
We are in direct competition with numerous oil and natural gas companies, drilling and income programs and partnerships exploring various areas of the Appalachian Basin and elsewhere competing for customers. Several of our competitors are large, well-known oil and gas and/or energy companies, but no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources, sometimes enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. We are more of a regional operator, and have the traditional competitive strengths of one, including recently established contacts and in-depth knowledge of the local geography. Additionally, there is increasing competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry. Management believes that there exists a viable market-place for smaller producers of natural gas and oil and for operators of smaller natural gas transmission systems.
Patents and Trademarks
 
The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trade name in order to increase our brand awareness. In that regard, we believe that our trade name is valuable asset that is critical to our success. As of the date of this filing, we have not submitted a trademark application for our name, Sylios Corp or that of any of our subsidiaries. In the event the Company does file an application, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will grant us a trademark. The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade name could diminish the value of our business concept and may cause a decline in our revenue.

Seasonality
 
The exploration for oil and natural gas reserves depends on access to areas where operations are to be conducted. Seasonal weather variations, including freeze-up and break-up affect access in certain circumstances. According to the American Petroleum Institute, more than 60 million U.S. households use natural gas for water heating, space heating, or cooking. In total, natural gas accounts for more than 50 percent of the fuel used to heat U.S. homes. Residential and commercial heating demand for natural gas is highly weather-sensitive, making weather the biggest driver of natural gas demand in the short term. As a result, natural gas demand is highly “seasonal” in nature, with significant “peaks” in the winter heating season.
 
Seasonality and the natural gas in storage also play a prominent role in natural gas prices. Because natural gas consumption is seasonal, but production is not, natural gas inventories are built during the summer for use in the winter. This seasonality leads to higher winter prices and lower summer prices. In addition, inventories above the seasonal average depress prices, and inventories below the seasonal average boost prices.


Government Regulations and Environmental Quality
 
Operations are or will be subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production.
 
Operations are or will also be subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.
 
In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we may be able to produce from the wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we may be able to drill.
 
Business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including energy, environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry. We plan to develop internal procedures and policies to ensure that operations are conducted in full and substantial environmental regulatory compliance.
 
Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on future operations.
 
We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive an effect on operations than on other similar companies in the energy industry. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with federal and state environmental requirements.


Furthermore, we are subject to various other federal, state, local and international laws and regulations applicable to its business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
 
Licenses
 
We held a Gathering Line Operators License in the state of Kentucky during the time we acted as the operator of our wells. As we no longer act in the capacity as the “Operator” of any shut-in/producing wells, the Company is no longer required to retain its operator license in the State of Kentucky. In the event that we would elect to act as the Operator of our wells, we would be required to submit an application to retain a license.

-----

Compliance Expenses
 
Our company incurs annual expenses to comply with state and federal licensing requirements. We estimate these costs to be under $2,000 per year. In the event we elect to drill any new wells in Kentucky, we anticipate annual expenditures of approximately $25,000 per well related to environmental costs including water drainage and land development. It is difficult to estimate these environmental expenses while we are still a development stage company as they are largely dependent on many factors for each drilled well. See “Government Regulation” and “Environmental Regulation” below.
Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
The principal markets for the Company’s crude oil are local refining companies. The principal markets for the Company’s natural gas production are local utilities, private industry end-users, and gas marketing companies.
 
When the wells we maintain a royalty interest in are in production, the crude oil produced is sold at or near the wells to Sunoco, Inc. or Barrett Oil Purchasing, Inc. The Company may sell some or all of its production to one or more additional refineries in order to maximize revenues as purchases prices offered by the refineries fluctuate from time to time. At present, all of the wells we maintain an interest are shut-in as contract labor initiates the re-entry of each to place them back into production.
 
Drilling Equipment
 
The Company obtains drilling services as required from time to time from various companies as available and various drilling contractors in Kentucky. The Company does not own any of its own drilling equipment nor maintain a storage facility in Kentucky.
Distribution Methods of Products or Services
 
Crude oil is normally delivered to refineries in Kentucky by tank truck and natural gas is distributed and transported by pipeline.
 
Commodity Price Volatility
 
Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and subject to a number of external factors. Prices are cyclical and fluctuate as a result of shifts in the balance between supply and demand for oil and natural gas, world and North American market forces, conflicts in Middle Eastern countries, inventory and storage levels, OPEC policy, weather patterns and other factors. OPEC supply curtailment, tensions in the Middle East, increased demand in China and low North American crude stocks have kept crude oil prices high. Natural gas prices are greatly influenced by market forces in North America since the primary source of supply is contained within the continent.
 
Market forces include the industry’s ability to find new production and reserves to offset declining production, economic factors influencing industrial demand, weather patterns affecting heating demand and the price of oil for fuel switching.
 
Labor and Other Supplies
 
Oil and Natural Gas Operations: We contract all labor for the development of leasehold acreage in preparation for drilling, as well as the drilling and completion crews. Our contract labor monitors the wells on a daily basis, replaces the completion components as needed, makes repairs to the gathering system, and any other day-to-day maintenance when our wells are in production.
 
Other Operational Activities: We contract all labor for website development, accounting, legal and daily activities outside of management.


Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we have one full time employee that serves in the role of President, Vice President, Treasurer and Director. Our sole officer and director also serve as the President and Chairman of the Board of Global Technologies, Ltd., a publicly traded company listed on the OTC Markets “PINK” under the symbol “GTLL” and serves as the sole officer and director of AMDAQ Corp. We plan to expand our management team within the next 12 months to include certain officers for our currently active subsidiaries and any new subsidiaries or operational activities management deems necessary. We consider our relations with our employees and consultants to be in good standing.
