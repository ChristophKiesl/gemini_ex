Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Founded in 1986, Nautilus, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, "Nautilus" or the "Company") is a global leader in innovative home fitness solutions, headquartered in Vancouver, Washington and incorporated in the State of Washington in January 1993. We became a publicly traded company in May 1999 and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Our company's diverse brand portfolio includes Bowflex®, Schwinn®, JRNY® and Nautilus® a broad selection of exercise bikes, cardio equipment, strength training products, as well as the JRNY® digital fitness platform.
Nautilus empowers healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. We sell our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments.
We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Nautilus empowers healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. We develop and market home fitness equipment and related products to meet the needs of a broad range of consumers. We have diversified our business by expanding our portfolio of high quality fitness equipment into multiple product lines utilizing our well-recognized brand names. We view the continual innovation of our product offerings as a key aspect of our business strategy. We regularly refresh our existing product lines with new technologies and finishes, and focus significant effort and resources on the development or acquisition of innovative new fitness products and technologies for introduction to the marketplace at periodic intervals.
Our long-term strategy involves:
•Enhancing our product lines by designing personalized connected-fitness equipment that meets or exceeds the high expectations of our existing and new customers;
•Continuing our investment in innovation, with a particular focus on expanding the reach of our digital platform, JRNY®;
•Creatively marketing our equipment, both directly to consumers and through our Retail customers, while leveraging our well-known brand names;
•Increasing our international Retail sales and distribution.

Our strategies incorporate the individual characteristics of our Direct and Retail businesses. Our Direct business focuses on: (i) the development of, or acquisition of rights to, unique, branded products and technologies; (ii) the application of creative, cost-effective ways to communicate the benefits of their use; and (iii) making various payment options available to our customers. We are particularly attentive to Direct business metrics that provide feedback regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of our media marketing programs and attractiveness of third-party consumer financing programs. 
In our Retail business, we strive to develop long-term relationships with key retailers of sports or fitness equipment. The primary objectives of our Retail business are (i) to offer a selection of innovative, unique products at key price-points to capture market share; and (ii) to utilize the strength of our brands and long-standing customer relationships to secure more exposure in the stores or websites of our Retail customers.
PRODUCTS

Our products are designed for home use by individuals with varying exercise needs.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
We conduct our business in two segments, Direct and Retail. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers primarily through our websites. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent companies to reach consumers in the home use markets in the U.S. and internationally.
For further information regarding our segments and geographic information, see Note 21, Segment and Enterprise-Wide Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
SALES AND MARKETING
Direct
In our Direct business, we sell our products directly to consumers via our websites bowflex.com, schwinnfitness.com and nautilus.com.
Our marketing efforts are based on an integrated combination of media and direct consumer contact. In addition to television advertising, our marketing mix includes a combination of digital, search, shopping and social media, as well as email and direct mail campaigns. Marketing and media effectiveness is measured continuously based on web traffic, leads generated, cost-per-lead, conversion rates, return on investment and other performance metrics and we strive to optimize the efficiency of our marketing and media expenditures based on this data. Almost all of our Direct customer orders are received either on our websites or through call centers.
Retail
In our Retail business, we market and sell a comprehensive line of consumer fitness equipment under the Bowflex®, Schwinn® and Nautilus® brands. Our products are marketed through a network of retail companies, via brick and mortar locations and those retailers' websites. Retail partners include, online-only retailers, sporting goods stores, electronics stores, furniture stores, large-format and warehouse stores, smaller specialty retailers and independent bike dealers.
We offer programs that provide price discounts to our Retail customers for ordering container-sized shipments or placing orders early enough in the season to allow for more efficient manufacturing by our Asian suppliers. These programs are designed to reduce our shipping and handling costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. In addition, we often offer other types of sales incentives to our Retail customers, including volume discounts and various forms of rebates or allowances, which generally are intended to increase product exposure and availability for consumers, reduce transportation costs, and encourage marketing and promotion of our brands or specific products.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND INNOVATION 
Innovation is a vital part of our business, and we continue to expand and diversify our product offerings by leveraging our research and development capabilities. We constantly search for new technologies and innovations that will help us grow our business, either through higher sales or increased production efficiencies. To accomplish this objective, we seek out ideas and concepts both within our company and from outside inventors. Recently, our investments have been focused on personalized connected-fitness such as voice coaching, simulated outdoor exploration and diverse music play list options with copyright clearance. Our JRNY® digital platform uses artificial intelligence and data from an initial assessment and every workout to create, and continually evolve, personalized daily workouts based on the user's fitness goals and capabilities. Our data shows the JRNY® system is coaching people to work out longer and getting them to stay with their fitness journey longer.
We rely on financial and engineering models to assist us in assessing the potential operational and economic impacts of adopting new technologies and innovations. If we determine that a third-party technology or innovation concept meets certain technical and financial criteria, we may enter into a licensing arrangement to utilize the technology or, in certain circumstances, purchase the technology for our own use. Our product design and engineering teams also invest considerable effort to improve product design and quality. As a consumer-driven company, we invest in qualitative and quantitative consumer research to help us assess new product concepts, optimal features and anticipated consumer adoption.
Our research and development expenses were $15.8 million, $14.3 million and $16.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in our research and development expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increased expenses related to personnel to develop and update our connected-fitness technology. The decrease in our research and development expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to increased capitalized investment for our connected-fitness technology. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2021 as we continue to supplement our investment in new product development, technology initiatives, and engineering capabilities.
SEASONALITY
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue from fitness equipment products varied seasonally. Sales were typically strongest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the second quarter as we believe that consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities during the spring and summer months, including outdoor exercise, which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment this seasonality had a significant effect on our inventory levels, working capital needs and resource utilization. In 2020, due to stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19 pandemic, we did not experience the typical seasonality.
MERCHANDISE SOURCING
All of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, and our manufacturing partners are primarily located in Asia. Although multiple factories bid on and are able to produce most of our products, we typically select one factory to be the primary supplier of any given product. Lead times for inventory purchases from our Asian suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately two to three months, of which transit time represents three to four weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand for our products. We attempt to compensate for our long replenishment lead times by maintaining adequate levels of inventory at our warehousing facilities.
We monitor our suppliers' ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce adherence to our quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration and our manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure our products from other sources at 
our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of raw materials and producing parts and finished products to our specifications.
In 2020, we experienced demand that significantly outpaced supply and we made efforts to increase the production capabilities of our Asian suppliers. We have increased capacity on all our modalities with an increased focus on connected fitness bikes, selectorized weights, and our new embedded screen products launched in late 2020 and early 2021. However, we are still experiencing supply constraints as the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic continues to put pressure on our lead times.
LOGISTICS
Our company-operated warehousing and distribution facilities are located in Oregon and Ohio. In addition to Company-operated distribution centers, we utilize third-party warehouses and logistics providers to fulfill orders. 
In our Direct business, we strive to maintain inventory levels that will allow us to ship our products shortly after receiving a customer's order. We use common carriers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments to Direct customers.
In our Retail business, we manage our inventory levels to accommodate anticipated seasonal changes in demand. Generally, we maintain higher inventory levels at the end of the third and fourth quarters to satisfy relatively higher consumer demand in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Many of our Retail customers place orders well in advance of peak periods of consumer demand to ensure an adequate supply for the anticipated selling season. 
In 2020, approximately 61% of our Retail customers' orders were shipped by our contract manufacturers in Asia directly to our Retail customers' locations, typically in container loads. The use of such direct shipments allows us to maintain lower levels of inventory in our warehouses, resulting in lower storage, handling, freight, insurance and other costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. We use various commercial truck lines for our merchandise shipments to Retail customers.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced demand that significantly outpaced supply and are still experiencing shipping constraints as the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic continues to put pressure on shipping container availability in Asia, global ship route availability, and overall shipping transit time.
COMPETITION
The markets for all of our products are highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business are quality, brand recognition, innovation and pricing. We believe we are well positioned to compete in markets in which we can take advantage of our strong brand names and that our focus on innovative product design, quality, and performance distinguishes our products from the competition.
Our products compete directly with those offered by a large number of companies that market consumer fitness equipment and fitness programs. As more retailers adopt eCommerce, our competitors have become increasingly similar across our Direct and Retail segments.
Our principal competitors include: Peloton, ICON Health & Fitness (NordicTrack), Johnson Health Tech, Technogym, Echelon, Mirror, Hydrow, Tonal, JaxJox and Tempo. We also compete with marketers of mobile device applications focused on fitness training and coaching on both iOS® and Android™ platforms, such as Peloton, Zwift, Strava, Mirror, BeachBody, Apple Fitness+, NeoU, Equinox+, FitScope, FitOn, Fulgaz Video Cycling, Sufferfest Training Systems, At Home Workouts by Daily Burn, and NIKE® Training Club. Additional marketers of competitive products include the following: activity trackers and content-driven physical activity products, such as Fitbit®, Garmin vivofit®, Whoop, and Oura; group fitness, such as cross-fit classes; and gym memberships, each of which offers alternative solutions for a fit and healthy lifestyle.
EMPLOYEES
As of February 22, 2021, we had 412 employees, 410 of whom were full-time. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a material interruption of our operations due to labor disputes.

We recognize the importance of wellness and fitness through company events and activities as well as encouraging holistic and healthy behaviors across numerous areas. 
Employee engagement and wellness
We measure and analyze employee engagement. We conduct surveys on at least an annual basis, analyze the results, provide feedback to employees of those results, and where appropriate develop initiatives around issues raised by employees. Nautilus also supports learning and development initiatives, implementation of health and safety measures and other employee wellness programs. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we transitioned our workforce to remote work environment and at our distribution centers added safety measures and protocols were added to enhance the wellness of our employees. We encourage to live a healthy life style by having a free on-site fitness center, discounts, employee driven wellness program and the opportunity to participate in many company sponsored fitness and community events throughout the year.
Talent acquisition and retention
We monitor our overall workforce composition and talent needs and competitive trends affecting talent acquisition to meet our talent needs We leverage and design programs to identify, foster, and retain our top talent throughout the organization. We provide employees compensation that is both competitive and consistent with the employees’ positions, experience, skill levels and knowledge, and market trends. We also retain national outside compensation and benefits consulting firms that evaluate the effectiveness of our benefit programs and benchmarking to our peers and industry while designing compensation programs to be in alignment with shareholder interests, employee retention, and linking compensation with corporate strategic goals.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Trademarks, patents and other forms of intellectual property are vital to the success of our business and are an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry. We regularly monitor commercial activity in our industry to identify potential infringement of our intellectual property. We protect our proprietary rights and attempt to take prompt, reasonable actions to prevent counterfeit products and other infringement on our intellectual property.
Trademarks
We own many trademarks, including Nautilus®, Bowflex®, Max Trainer®, TreadClimber®, Power Rod®, Bowflex Revolution®, SelectTech®, Airdyne®, Max Total®, Explore the World®, VeloCore® and JRNY®. Nautilus is the exclusive licensee under the Schwinn® mark for indoor fitness products. We believe that having distinctive trademarks that are readily identifiable by consumers is an important factor in creating a market for our products, maintaining a strong company identity and developing brand loyalty among our customers. In addition, we have granted licenses to a third party to use the Nautilus®, Schwinn® and TreadClimber® trademarks on commercial fitness products, for which we receive royalty income and expanded consumer awareness of our brands.
Each federally registered trademark is renewable indefinitely if the trademark is still in use at the time of renewal.
Patents and Designs
Building our intellectual property portfolio is an important factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness equipment industry. We have followed a policy of filing applications for U.S. and non-U.S. patents on utility and design inventions that we deem valuable to our business.
We own or license patents and design registrations covering a variety of technologies, some of which are utilized in our selectorized dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, treadmills, exercise bikes, and elliptical machines. Patent and design protection for these technologies, which are utilized in products sold in both the Direct and Retail segments, extends as far as 2045.
We maintain a portfolio of patents related to our TreadClimber® specialized cardio machines, which are sold primarily in our Direct segment. The portfolio includes patents with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2027. 
We maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to our Max Trainer® specialized cardio machines, which are sold in our Direct and Retail segments. The portfolio includes issued patents with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2037, and additional pending patent applications.

Nautilus is the licensee of patents related to the Bowflex Revolution® home gyms and patents related to the VeloCore® bike. The home gym patents have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2025, and the bike patents have expiration dates in 2027. 
BACKLOG
We define our customer order backlog to include firm orders for future shipment to our Retail customers, as well as unfulfilled consumer orders within the Direct segment.
Backlog as of a given date fluctuates based on specific timing of product shipment within the typical shipment timeframes for each of our segments. Due to the severe shortage of shipping containers, some factory fulfilled orders, representing over $16 million in revenue, did not ship in late December. Container shortages, worsening global logistics disruptions, and continued factory capacity constraints resulted in $91.5 million in backlog as of December 31, 2020. Our customer order backlog as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.8 million.
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
In 2020, 2019 and 2018, Amazon.com and Dick's Sporting Goods accounted for more than 10% of total net sales as follows:

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters. 
Our operations and certain disposed components of our former Commercial business expose us to claims related to environmental matters. Although compliance with federal, state, local and international environmental legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows in the past, there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such environmental matters in the future.
Our digital platforms may receive, process, transmit and store personal health and fitness information relating to identifiable individuals. Consumer demand for personalized fitness experiences, through mobile applications or wearable fitness trackers and our focus on digital fitness solutions for our products may increase the volume of identifiable individual information we receive on our platforms and through our products. We also receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals in our capacity as an employer. As a result, we may 
be subject to numerous United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect both individually identifiable information as well as personal health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), each of which governs, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. The GDPR includes, and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted, consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and include jurisdiction-specific obligations.
We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and our controls in place are adequate for our continued compliance.
