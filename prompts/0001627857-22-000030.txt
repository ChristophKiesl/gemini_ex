ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc. (“SailPoint,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”) is the leading provider of enterprise identity security solutions. SailPoint's business was built by a team of visionary industry veterans to address the complex enterprise identity security challenge. For the modern enterprise, securely connecting the right people to the right technology is incredibly complex and has moved well beyond human capacity alone. SailPoint's autonomous approach helps organizations easily discover, manage and secure all identities (both human and non-human software bots) and their access to technology resources, all done at the speed and scale their business demands.
We strive to meet our customers where they are, offering both software as a service (“SaaS”) and software platforms, which provide organizations visibility and the intelligence required to both seamlessly empower users and securely manage their access to systems, applications and data across hybrid information technology (“IT”) environments, spanning on-premises and cloud applications and file storage platforms. We help customers enable their businesses with more agile and frictionless IT, streamline and accelerate the delivery of access to their businesses, enhance their security posture and better meet compliance and regulatory requirements. Our customers include many of the world’s largest and most complex organizations, including commercial enterprises, financial institutions and governments.
Organizations globally are investing in technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) to improve employee productivity, business agility and competitiveness. Today, enterprise environments are more open and interconnected with their business partners, contractors, vendors and customers. Business users have driven a dramatic increase in the number of applications and amount of data that organizations need to manage, much of which sits beyond the traditional network perimeter. Because of these trends, the attack surface is expanding while well-funded cyber attackers, in some cases sponsored by nation-states, have significantly increased the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. As a result, IT professionals need to manage and secure increasingly complex hybrid IT environments within these extended enterprises.
Attackers frequently target the identity vector as it allows them to leverage user identities to gain access to high-value systems and data while concealing their activity and movements within an organization’s IT infrastructure. The consequences of a data breach can be extremely damaging, with organizations facing significant costs to remediate the breach and repair brand and reputational damage. In addition, governments and regulatory bodies have increased efforts to protect users and their data with a new wave of regulatory and compliance measures that are further burdening organizations and levying severe penalties for non-compliance. As a result of these trends, enterprises are struggling to efficiently manage and secure their digital identities.
We believe that our identity security platform is a critical, foundational layer of a modern enterprise security strategy, which increasingly leverages a zero-trust approach for securing access. Open architecture allows our platform to complement and build upon traditional perimeter- and endpoint-centric security solutions, which we believe on their own are increasingly insufficient to secure organizations, and their applications and data. We deliver an identity security platform that forms a holistic view of the enterprise's identities, both human and non-human, and their access to all applications, data and infrastructures. In combination with our technology partners, we create identity awareness throughout our customers’ environments by providing valuable insights into, and incorporating information from, a broad range of enterprise software and security solutions. Our identity security platform provides a system of record for digital identities across our customers’ IT environments while allowing them to remain agile and competitive. Our adaptable solutions integrate seamlessly into existing technology stacks, allowing organizations to maximize the value of their technology investments. Our professionals work closely with customers throughout the implementation lifecycle, from documentation to development to integration.
Our solutions harness the power of AI and ML to deliver the intelligence, automation and integration needed to easily manage access across the largest, most complex cloud enterprises worldwide. Our go-to-market strategy consists of both direct sales and indirect sales through resellers and system integrators. Our mature system integrator channel includes global consultants such as Accenture, Deloitte, Ernst & Young (“EY”), KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”), all of whom have dedicated SailPoint practices, with some dating back more than 10 years. 
Our Growth Strategy
Key investments we are making to drive growth include:
•Driving new customer growth within existing geographic markets. There is a significant opportunity to expand our footprint through both new, greenfield deployments and displacement of competitive legacy solutions in the markets that we currently serve. We plan to expand our customer base in these countries by continuing to grow our sales organization, expand and leverage our channel partnerships and enhance our marketing efforts.
•Further penetrating our existing customer base. Our customer base of 2,259, as of December 31, 2021, provides a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. Our customers have the flexibility to start with a single use case or project and expand over time. As they realize the value of their investment, new use cases and deployments are identified, allowing us to sell more products to existing customers and to expand the number and types of identities, including non-human and machine identities, and governed systems we cover within their organizations. This is especially true when it comes to our new and expanded SaaS offerings, including AI and cloud governance. We believe strong customer satisfaction is fundamental to our ability to expand our customer relationships.
•Continuing to invest in our platform. Innovation is a core part of our culture. We believe we have established a reputation as a technology leader and innovator in identity security. We intend to continue investing, particularly in our SaaS offerings, to extend our position as the leader in identity security by developing or acquiring new products and technologies.
•Leveraging and expanding our network of partners. Our partnerships with global system integrators, such as Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, and resellers have helped us extend our reach and serve our customers more effectively. We see a significant opportunity to offer comprehensive solutions to customers by collaborating with adjacent technology vendors. We intend to continue to invest in our partnership network as their influence on our sales is vital to the success of our business.
•Expanding market and product investment across existing vertical markets. We believe there is significant opportunity to further penetrate our target vertical markets by continuing to provide vertical-specific identity solutions and focusing our marketing efforts to address the use cases of those customers. With this approach, we believe we will be better able to address opportunities in key industries, such as financial services, healthcare, and federal, state and local government.
•Continuing to expand our global presence. We believe there is significant opportunity to grow our business internationally. Enterprises around the world are facing similar operational, security and compliance challenges, driving the need for identity governance. We have personnel in 18 countries and customers based in 65 countries as of December 31, 2021, and we generated 31% of our revenue outside of the United States in 2021. We plan to leverage our existing strong relationships with global system integrators and channel partners to grow our presence in Europe, Asia Pacific and other international markets.

Our solutions are built on our open identity platform, which creates a flexible deployment to address a wide range of customer use cases and enables integration to a variety of security and operational IT applications such as IT service management solutions (e.g., BMC Remedy and ServiceNow), privileged access management (“PAM”) (e.g., CyberArk and BeyondTrust), enterprise mobility management and security information and event management. Our open 
identity platform extends the reach of our identity security processes and enables effective identity security controls across unique customer environments.
IdentityNow
IdentityNow is our cloud-based, multi-tenant identity security platform, which is delivered as a SaaS subscription offering. IdentityNow provides customers with a set of fully integrated services for compliance, provisioning and password management for applications and data hosted on-premises or in the cloud. IdentityNow meets the most stringent identity security requirements and provides enterprise-grade services that meet scalability, performance, availability and security demands. IdentityNow enables organizations to:
•Automate identity security processes in one unified solution delivered from the cloud;

•Eliminate the need to buy, deploy and maintain hardware and software to run an identity security solution.
We package and price IdentityNow into a Cloud Platform and Governance Services with unique functionality as outlined below:
•Cloud Platform: IdentityNow provides foundational components for identity security in the cloud, including production and sandbox instances and the IdentityNow Cloud Gateway virtual appliance, which leverages our patented method for integrating with on-premises applications and data. IdentityNow also includes a large catalog of pre-built connectors and application profiles to on-premises and cloud applications, leveraging the intellectual property developed for IdentityIQ. It is included with all Governance Services at no additional charge.
•User Provisioning: This module enables business users to be productive from day one. With IdentityNow user provisioning, organizations can streamline the on-boarding and off-boarding process with best practice configurations and workflows, enabling IT to immediately grant employees access to the applications and data they need to do their jobs.
•Access Request: This module empowers the entire enterprise with a robust self-service solution for requesting and approving access to applications and data. Automating the access request process quickly delivers business users the access they need to do their jobs.
•Access Certifications: This module automates the process of reviewing user access privileges across the organization. Using IdentityNow, organizations can quickly plan, schedule and execute certification campaigns to ensure the right users have the appropriate access to corporate resources.
•Separation-of-Duties: This module simplifies and speeds the process of investigating access, quickly uncovering any access-related conflicts of interest for review and mitigation. It also automates the creation of policies that ensure continuous compliance with internal and external audit requirements.
•Password Management: This module offers business users an intuitive, self-service experience for managing and resetting passwords from any device and from anywhere. This service enforces consistent and secure password policies for all users across all systems from the cloud to the data center.
IdentityIQ
IdentityIQ is our on-premises identity security solution, which can be hosted in the public cloud or deployed in a customer’s data center. It provides large, complex enterprise customers a unified and highly configurable identity security solution that consistently applies business and security policies as well as role and risk models across applications and data on-premises or hosted in the cloud. IdentityIQ enables organizations to:
•Empower users to request and gain access to enterprise applications and data;
•Enable business users to reset their passwords via self-service tools without the need for IT involvement;
•Provide on-demand visibility to IT, business and risk managers into “which identities have access to what resources” to help make business decisions, improve security and meet audit requirements;
•Improve security and eliminate common weak points associated with data breaches, including weak passwords, orphaned accounts, entitlement creep and separation-of-duties policy violations; and
•Manage compliance using automated access certifications and policy management.
We package and price IdentityIQ into Core Modules and Advanced Integration Modules. All customers leverage the IdentityIQ Governance Platform, which provides the base features of the solution, including the identity warehouse, workflow engine and governance models. The three Core Modules include:
•Lifecycle Manager: This module provides a business-oriented solution that delivers access securely and cost effectively. The self-service access request capabilities feature an intuitive user interface that empowers business users to take an active role in managing changes to their access while greatly reducing the burden on IT organizations. Automated provisioning manages the business processes of granting, modifying and revoking access throughout a user’s lifecycle with an organization, whether that user is an employee, contractor or business partner. Changes to user access can be automatically provisioned via a large library of direct connectors for applications such as Workday and SAP or synchronized with IT service management solutions such as ServiceNow.
•Compliance Manager: This module enables the business to improve compliance and audit performance while lowering costs. It provides business user friendly access certifications and automated policy management controls (e.g., separation-of-duty violation reporting) that are designed to simplify and streamline audit processes across all applications and data. Built-in audit reporting and analytics give IT, business and audit teams visibility into, and management over, all compliance activities in the organization.
•File Access Manager: This module, a rebranded and repackaged version of the SecurityIQ product line, secures access to the growing amount of data stored in file servers, collaboration portals, mailboxes and cloud storage systems. The change was made to align the positioning and packaging of solutions with how our customers are purchasing and deploying a comprehensive identity security strategy. It helps organizations identify where sensitive data resides, which identities have access to it, and how they are using it and then puts effective controls in place to secure it. File Access Manager is designed to interoperate with the Compliance Manager and Lifecycle Manager modules to provide comprehensive visibility and governance over user access to all data. By augmenting identity data from structured systems with data from unstructured data targets, organizations can more quickly identify and mitigate risks, spot compliance issues and make the right decisions when granting or revoking access to sensitive data.
The Advanced Integration Modules provide connectivity to target application platforms such as SAP, mainframes and file storage systems.
SailPoint Identity Services
SailPoint Identity Services are delivered as multi-tenant SaaS subscription services and are designed to integrate and extend IdentityNow and IdentityIQ. We package and price SailPoint Identity Services individually. The current list of SailPoint Identity Services includes:
•Access Insights: collects a wealth of identity information, turns that information into actionable insights and provides business-oriented dashboards and reports to track the effectiveness of customers’ identity programs;
•Access Modeling: uses AI and ML to suggest roles based on similar access between users and gives customers insights to confirm the correct access for each role; 
•Access Risk Management: our cloud‐based access controls solution that enables customers to manage their risk by automating access controls for business applications with complex security requirements;

Technology
Our comprehensive, enterprise-grade identity security platform is the result of both years of investment and the expertise of the Company’s management and technical teams. Taking the lessons learned from our experiences with prior generation identity solutions, our engineers and architects designed a modern identity platform with internet scale, comprehensive hybrid environment coverage, and openness to optimize customers’ existing technology investments.
Identity Cube Technology
Our Identity Cube technology establishes the 360-degree control essential to govern and secure digital identities in today’s complex IT environments. Our extensive data modeling capabilities allow us to understand how each identity relates to the full IT environment, whether on-premises or in the cloud. SailPoint’s account correlation and orphan account management 
capabilities allow IT security professionals and business managers to track and monitor the accounts that are most frequently under attack.
Identity Cubes track all relevant information about an identity and its relationships to applications and data. They create the “identity context” which is key to an identity-aware infrastructure in which identity information is shared across the extended enterprise. With identity context, operational and security systems can make informed decisions about access and perform key remediation and change requests on our open identity platform via our standardized application program interfaces (“APIs”) and software development kits (“SDKs”).
Model-Based Governance
Our model-based governance engine sits at the center of our platform and provides a comprehensive understanding of both the current state of which identities currently have access to what as well as the desired state of who should have access to what. The governance engine is responsible for managing the ongoing process of aligning these two states.
Governance and control models are used to drive our policy-based reconciliation service and to define how reconciliation and provisioning fulfillment actions are executed. These models are designed with graphical tools, enabling IT and business users to own and define the reconciliation and fine-grained access provisioning fulfillment processes for applications and data.
Access Modeling
Our AI-based Access Modeling is designed to continually model and adapt access to evolving business needs. Leveraging AI, Access Modeling evaluates the access that users have, including collections of entitlements bundled into roles, and recommends new access models. Once approved and created, these access models can be assigned to identities. Access Modeling also continually monitors for updates to existing roles within the access model to help enforce the principle of least privileged access.
Recommendation Engine
The patented Recommendation Engine leverages AI and ML technologies to automate mundane tasks and provide our identity platform users with insights in order to make more informed decisions. Based on identity information and attributes collected, the Recommendation Engine identifies and classifies access as acceptable or risky, along with the reasons for those classifications. These recommendations are visually presented to users reviewing access, so they can quickly, and efficiently, make decisions. Recommendations can also be used to automatically approve acceptable access.
Provisioning Broker
Our provisioning broker provides separation between identity processes at the business level (e.g., requesting access to an application) and the actual fulfillment of that request on the target system. The provisioning broker is a specialized business process workflow execution engine that manages long-running provisioning tasks and provides tracking, monitoring and statistics for the end-to-end fulfillment process.
The decoupling capability of the provisioning broker maximizes our customers’ flexibility and allows for the reuse of their existing IT investments. For example, if access to an application can only be provided manually through the opening of a help desk ticket, the provisioning broker will send that request to the help desk and report back on the status of that request. Likewise, if a customer utilizes a legacy provisioning system, the provisioning broker can pass off a request to that legacy system for fulfillment. In addition, the provisioning broker provides us with a unique migration strategy for customers moving from a legacy system to our identity security solutions.
Enterprise-Grade Cloud Gateway
To manage on-premises infrastructure, applications and data from the cloud, we employ a Cloud Gateway Server (“CGS”), delivered as a virtual machine behind the customer’s firewall, which ensures that all SailPoint communications are highly secure. Our CGS technology is a high availability, secure, self-managed container that allows for controlled and automated updates of our connector infrastructure while ensuring the integrity of individual on-premises and cloud connections.
Our CGS also provides an innovative and patented approach to protecting our customer’s credentials. Our “zero-knowledge encryption” technology allows us to store all of a customer’s passwords and security credentials inside the CGS behind their firewall. As a result, we protect the confidentiality of our customers’ system and end-user credentials, even if our cloud service provider were to be breached.
Data Ownership Assessment and Election
Verifying the business end-user who is the logical owner of information is a key challenge in managing growing volumes of unstructured data in the enterprise. Our novel, patent-supported approach determines the rightful owner of files, so they can be integrated into governance control processes, such as access certifications and access approvals. Our solution leverages profile data to determine logical owners of information based on identity attributes and usage data. Once a set of logical owners is identified, we use a crowd-sourcing approach to allow other users familiar with the data to vote on the rightful owner of the file or file storage location. This enables organizations to efficiently identify and designate specific owners for sensitive information stored in files and incorporate them into identity security processes.
Connectivity for the Hybrid IT Environment
Our extensive library of over 100 proprietary connectors provides interfaces to on-premises and cloud applications. These connectors are the means by which we provide governance over target systems. We support granular management of a wide range of systems, from mainframe security managers, including CA ACF2 and Top Secret, IBM and RACF, to traditional enterprise applications, including Oracle E-Business Suite and SAP, and pure SaaS business applications, such as Microsoft Office365, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack and Zoom. Generally, the same connectors are used for both our on-premises and cloud-based products. This allows both solutions to leverage fully the over 400-person years we have invested in developing these connectors.
Open and Integrated Identity Platform
Our open identity platform is the result of over a decade of investment. Recognizing identity security is at the center of critical enterprise business and IT processes, we developed a comprehensive set of services that go beyond simple APIs. In addition to our comprehensive API strategy, we deliver SDKs and plug-in frameworks which allow our partners and customers to create their own integrations and extensions to our core product capabilities. For example, we leverage our open identity platform to integrate with third-party user provisioning solutions, such as IBM Security Identity Manager and Oracle Identity Manager, and service desk solutions, such as BMC Remedy and ServiceNow, to implement account change requests. This enables SailPoint to govern access and provide identity context to downstream processes managed by these solutions. Another important open identity platform integration model is with PAM solutions. SailPoint provides a framework that enables organizations to use the same governance controls to oversee both privileged and standard account access. We also collect activity and other information from third-party solutions to improve risk analytics and identity security processes in our products.
Our APIs and SDKs are compliant with System for Cross-domain Identity Management (“SCIM”) and both provide standards-based bi-directional runtime access to our identity context model. Many such integrations and extensions have already been built by partners and certified for commercialization on our open identity platform.
Our SaaS Event Trigger Service emits actionable events that allows customers to extend identity security into their own application ecosystems. Once subscribed to these events, SailPoint starts streaming identity events into their custom integrations.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services. Our quarterly sales are impacted by industry buying patterns. As a result, our sales have generally been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and lowest in the first quarter.
Customers
As of December 31, 2021, we have 2,259 customers based in 65 countries. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated 31% of our revenue outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2021, our revenue did not materially depend on any single customer.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our platform through our direct sales organization, which is comprised of field and inside sales personnel, as well as through channel partners. Our sales strategy often reflects a “land-and-expand” business model, in which our initial deployment with a new customer typically addresses a limited number of use cases within a single business unit. Such initial deployments frequently expand across departments, divisions and geographies through a need for additional users, increased usage or extended functionality. As we expand our portfolio of offerings within our platform, we execute a growing number of “solution” deals that include more than one of our products in the initial transaction.
Our sales force is structured by geography, customer size, status (customer or prospect) and industry. Our global sales organization is comprised of quota-carrying sales representatives supported by sales development representatives, sales engineers, partner managers, product and technical specialists and solution architects.
Partners constitute an essential part of our selling model. We have established a model designed to create zero conflict, and typically include our partners in all of our training and enablement efforts. As a result, our indirect sales model, executed through our global and regional system integrators, technology partners and value-added resellers, is a key factor in our overall success.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is focused on the following core areas: driving strong global brand awareness and differentiation for SailPoint, leveraging digital marketing tools to engage and educate our buyers, and creating a strong and “tuned in” pipeline for our sales force. Our data-driven digital approach to marketing is tightly aligned to the needs of our addressable market and provides agility to leverage market opportunities in a targeted and timely fashion. Our awareness and educational efforts focus on branding and awareness campaigns, digital and content marketing, public and analyst relations, social media engagement and influencer relations, and thought leadership including blogs and bylines. Engagement programs include digital campaigns and webinars, customer-submitted peer reviews, and virtual/hybrid events such as Navigate, while pipeline maturation focuses on customer and executive advisory boards and round tables. Pipeline generation and maturation efforts focus on efficiently and effectively moving targeted accounts through their buyer’s journey and through the SailPoint pipeline. While digital marketing efforts are managed centrally and regionally, engagements programs are run in our three major geographies: (i) the Americas, (ii) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). Audiences for such events are typically IT and security professionals, including chief information officers and chief information security officers. Our global virtual Navigate user conferences demonstrate our strong commitment to enabling our customers to succeed, while also serving as an opportunity to create pipeline for new sales to prospective customers and additional sales to existing customers.
Professional Services and Maintenance and Customer Support
Professional Services
We are primarily focused on ensuring that our professional services partners, who perform a majority of the implementations for our customers, are able to implement our solutions successfully. We provide “expert services” to partners and customers for complex implementation assistance. We also lead direct implementations when requested by a customer. We believe that our investment in professional services and in our partners will drive increased adoption of our platform.
Maintenance and Customer Support
Our customers receive one year of software maintenance and support as part of their initial purchase of our on-premises offerings and may renew their maintenance and support agreement following the initial period. Our cloud-based offerings include customer support. For our on-premises offerings, our maintenance provides customers with the right to receive major releases of their purchased solutions, maintenance releases and patches and access to our technical support services during the term of the agreement. We provide customers of our cloud-based offerings with technical support services and all aspects of infrastructure support. We maintain a customer support organization, which includes experienced, trained engineers who provide 24x7x365 support for critical issues. Customers receive contractual response times, telephonic support 
and access to online support portals. Our customer support organization has global capabilities, a deep expertise in our solutions and, through select support partners, is able to deliver support in multiple languages.
Customer Success Management
Our customer success strategy centers around our investment in, and ownership of, the post-sale experience for our customers. Every customer has access to our team of Customer Success Managers (“CSMs”), whose goal is to help customers achieve their desired return on investment and business results. Through proactive and regular engagements, the CSM team endeavors to keep every customer satisfied and help them use their SailPoint products or services optimally. When necessary, the CSM coordinates cross-departmental resources to remove any barrier to success. In addition, our customer success team utilizes customer data to identify and present any cross-sell or upsell solutions aligned to a customer’s business objectives, thereby contributing to revenue expansion and increased product penetration. By proactively managing customer relationships, our CSM team nurtures client advocates, who become a powerful asset in closing new business.
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
As a core part of our strategy, we have cultivated strong relationships with partners to help us increase our reach and influence, while providing a broader distribution of our identity security services. We have developed a large partner network consisting of technology partners, system integrators, a growing network of value-added resellers and our alliance partners (Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC). In 2021, approximately 76% of our new customer transactions involved our partner network. We believe that our extensive partnership network enables us to provide the most complete identity security solution to our customers.
Technology Partners
We have partnered with industry leaders across a spectrum of technologies that enable organizations to integrate their entire security, mobility, cloud, and applications infrastructure into our platform so that breaches can be better identified, mitigated and contained, and operations can be streamlined. We believe that solutions from companies such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), CyberArk, Microsoft, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday that are plugged into our open identity platform through APIs provide our customers value-added capabilities to build an identity-aware enterprise.
The SailPoint Technology Partner Program is a technology partnering network that leverages familiar standards and methods—like SQL, SCIM and Representational State Transfer—that make it easy to share identity context and configure identity-specific policies across disparate systems. For example, when PAM systems are integrated with our solutions, enterprises can conduct regular audits of privileged users and automatically remediate any policy violations. Program offerings include access to SailPoint SDKs and APIs, developer support, and cloud-based certification services. The Identity+ Alliance comprises over 60 technology and implementation partners and has produced over 40 certified integrations.
Value-Added Resellers
Value-added resellers bring product expertise and implementation best practices to our customers globally. They provide vertical expertise and technical advice in addition to reselling or bundling our software. Many of our reseller partners have been trained to demonstrate and promote our identity platform. Our reseller channel ranges from large companies to regional resellers in our markets and territories. Our reseller program is designed to scale growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience and increase profitability as well as sales efficiency.
System Integrators
We partner with many large and global system integrators. We have partnerships with global advisory firms such as Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC, with global system integrators such as Accenture, and with many regional system integrators in all three of our geographies. The focus of our system integrators program is to deliver pipeline growth and bookings, to help partners drive self-sufficiency and to foster transparency and collaboration through shared assets and resources. We have 
implemented joint business controls and metrics that provide a platform for discussion and partnership development and help us optimize our program and unified value proposition.
Research and Development
Innovation is one of our core values, and it is at the heart of how we think and do business. We believe ongoing and timely development of new products and features is imperative to maintaining our competitive position. We continue to invest in both our cloud and on-premises solutions. Additionally, we will be opportunistic in leveraging technology acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, our research and development team had 468 employees.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market characterized by constant change and innovation. Our competitors include large enterprise software vendors that offer identity solutions within their product portfolios, pure play identity vendors (including new market entrants) and vendors with whom we have not traditionally competed but may either introduce new products or incorporate features into existing products that compete with our solutions.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•Comprehensiveness of visibility to which identities have access to what across cloud and on-premises applications and data repositories;
•Reliability and effectiveness in defining and implementing identity security policies;
•Flexibility to deploy identity security and administration as a SaaS solution or as a software-based solution on-premises or in the cloud;
•Adherence to government and industry regulations and standards;
•Comprehensiveness and interoperability of the solution with other IT and security solutions;
•Enterprise security, scalability and performance;
•Ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
•Quality and responsiveness of support organizations;
•Total cost of ownership;
•Ease of use; and
•Customer experience.
Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater name recognition, in some cases within particular geographic regions, and more extensive geographic presence than we do. However, we believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of all the factors above.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment proprietary information and inventions assignment agreements, trademarks and patents to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license software from third parties for integration into our product solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our product solutions and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. We have 47 issued patents and 27 patent applications pending in the United States relating to certain aspects of our technology. Additionally, we have three issued patents and two patent applications pending internationally. The expiration dates of our issued patents range from 2024 to 2041. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for information regarding potential risks associated with our intellectual property and our ability to protect it. 
Human Capital Management
We believe that our success as a company is strongly linked to our core values: 
•Innovation – developing creative solutions to real challenges;
•Integrity – delivering on the commitments we make;
•Impact – measuring and rewarding results, not activity; and
•Individuals – valuing every person at SailPoint.
These values are cornerstones of our organizational culture. Our human capital strategy includes team member engagement efforts, career development and training opportunities and other programs designed to attract and retain top talent. 
It is critical to engage our team members to maintain a positive culture, and our annual global employee engagement survey helps us evaluate our efforts in light of our core principles. Overall team member satisfaction reached 90% each of the last four years that we conducted this survey, and over the last 10 years, organizations such as the Austin Business Journal, Fortune, and Glassdoor have recognized SailPoint as a “best place to work.” We focus on ensuring that our diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts create and maintain a positive culture in which all team members can succeed and thrive. Those efforts include implementing focused training on recognizing and removing bias from our recruitment process, broadening our talent pool through diversity-focused talent acquisition vendors, conducting pay equity reviews during our merit and equity planning process and designing other programs to improve indicators related to inclusion and equity in our workforce.
Our training and development efforts, built around our core values, are another key part of our human capital strategy. Our leaders go through specific training to ensure they are leading their teams with our values at the forefront of the decisions they make. Our annual performance review process allows team members to engage in meaningful discussions with their managers about their performance and development goals. Additionally, our managers assess the growth potential of each team member through a standardized evaluation process, which provides actionable outputs to help develop and retain our high-potential employees. We also enable our team with regular interactive sessions covering a wide range of topics including interrupting unconscious bias, wellness, local volunteering opportunities, and best practices to use our latest technologies and work in a hybrid environment more effectively. Through these and other training efforts, we support the development of our crew members in a way that promotes our growth and innovation. 
Offering a competitive compensation and benefits package is a critical part of our effort to attract and retain top talent. In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer team members comprehensive health, welfare, income protection and long-term savings benefits, the opportunity to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and incentive equity compensation and incentive cash plans for eligible team members. Total compensation is designed to align with SailPoint’s business objectives and financial goals, and pay is differentiated for individuals based on relevant experience, impact, relative internal value and company performance. Variable compensation delivers pay aligned with company and individual performance, with more pay at risk at more senior levels. Leadership regularly discusses compensation and benefits strategies with the compensation committee of our board of directors.
As we work to execute our growth strategy, as described above, we continue to invest in human capital resources that will sustain and fuel that growth. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 1,676 employees, including 468 involved in research and development activities, 666 in our sales and marketing organization, 343 in professional services and customer support, and 199 in general and administrative activities. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 29% of our employees were located outside of the United States. Ensuring that we have the right people in the right positions is essential to our strategy for sustained growth.
Government Regulations 
A wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, disposal and other processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect any personal or other customer data, could result in enforcement actions against us, including regulatory fines, as well as claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial performance and prospects. 
Domestically, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) which took effect on January 1, 2020, creating additional new consumer privacy rights, and providing for both civil penalties as well as a private right of action for data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which expands the CCPA, was passed in November 2020. The CPRA will go into effect January 1, 2023 and provides for additional consumer privacy rights, increased penalties, and establishes a new dedicated California data protection regulator with rule-making and audit authorities. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation. Additional states have passed privacy laws, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which are similar to the CCPA. The CCPA imposed additional regulatory risks and burdens on our company. Additional resources will be required to respond to these changes in the law and coming regulations, including to implement new internal and customer supporting compliance procedures, and potentially to offer new product features to respond to data protection requirements or related market trends.
Also domestically, the Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates.” We function as a business associate for certain of our customers that are HIPAA-covered entities and service providers and, in that context, we are regulated as a business associate for the purposes of HIPAA. The HIPAA-covered entities and service providers to which we provide services require us to enter into HIPAA-compliant business associate agreements with them. These agreements impose stringent data security obligations on us. Modifying the already stringent penalty structure that was present under HIPAA prior to HITECH, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
In jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may face heightened data protection and privacy requirements. For example, our business is subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “UK GDPR”) and the European Union (the “EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (the “EU GDPR” and, together with the UK GDPR, the “GDPR”), as we sell our solutions in both the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Among other things, the GDPR regulates the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal data, including the transfer of personal data to third countries, such as the United States. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in its Schrems II ruling invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, a self-certification mechanism that facilitated the lawful transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, with immediate effect. The CJEU upheld the validity of standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) as a legal mechanism to transfer personal data, but companies relying on SCCs will need to carry out a transfer privacy impact assessment, which among other things, assesses laws governing access to personal data in the recipient country and considers whether supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs will need to be implemented to ensure an ‘essentially equivalent’ level of data protection to that afforded in the EEA. The GDPR also imposes significant fines and penalties for non-compliance and serious violations of certain requirements, and the GDPR and other international data protection laws are subject to differing interpretations.
