ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company leveraging our novel non-aqueous formulation technology platforms, XeriSolTM and XeriJectTM, to develop and commercialize ready-to-use injectable and infusible drug formulations. We have developed and launched the first ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon formulation that, unlike the current standard of care, can be administered without any preparation or reconstitution. Our first product, GvokeTM, delivers ready-to-use glucagon via a commercially available pre-filled syringe ("Gvoke PFS") or auto-injector, Gvoke HypoPenTM ("Gvoke HypoPen") for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, a potentially life-threatening condition, in people with diabetes. Gvoke was approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ("FDA") for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages two years and older on September 10, 2019. We began the commercial launch of Gvoke PFS in November 2019. Gvoke PFS is available in two doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and a 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. We expect Gvoke HypoPen will be commercially available in July 2020, in the same doses as the Gvoke PFS. Additionally, in November 2019, we submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application ("MAA") to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for our novel ready-to-use, room temperature stable liquid glucagon formulation for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes. We are also applying our novel liquid glucagon formulation to the management of hypoglycemia associated with additional intermittent and chronic conditions with significant unmet medical need. Finally, we are applying our technology platforms to other commercially available drugs to enable more convenient and patient-friendly subcutaneous ("SC") and intramuscular ("IM") routes of administration, including the development of products to address unmet needs in both diabetes and epilepsy. We own the rights to our proprietary formulation technology platforms, Gvoke, and our product candidates domestically and internationally, with 114 patents issued globally, including a composition of matter patent covering our ready-to-use glucagon formulation that expires in 2036.
Our proprietary XeriSol and XeriJect non-aqueous formulation technology platforms allow for the subcutaneous and intramuscular delivery of highly concentrated, ready-to-use formulations of peptides, small molecules, and proteins (including monoclonal antibodies) using commercially available syringes, auto-injectors, multi-dose pens and infusion pumps. Current aqueous formulations of certain drugs present numerous challenges for patients and caregivers, including multi-step reconstitution, refrigerated storage, reduced shelf life, large injection volumes, and intravenous ("IV") administration over long periods of time. We believe our broadly applicable platforms can provide distinct advantages over existing formulations by eliminating reconstitution and refrigeration, enabling long-term room-temperature stability, significantly reducing injection volume and enabling patient-convenient SC or IM administration versus IV infusion. We believe that our technology platforms can lead to products that will improve outcomes and enable easier administration while reducing costs for payors and the healthcare system.
Our key priority is the commercialization of our first product, Gvoke, for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes to address limitations of traditional glucagon kits. Hypoglycemia, a key concern of people with both Type 1 Diabetes ("T1D") and Type 2 Diabetes ("T2D"), occurs when a person has a deficiency of glucose in their bloodstream, often as a result of insulin treatment. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include fatigue, shakiness, anxiety, headache, nausea and vomiting, and in severe cases, hypoglycemia can result in cardiovascular disease, seizure, coma, and, if left untreated, death. The current standard of care for severe hypoglycemia in the ambulatory setting is the emergency administration of glucagon, a hormone that raises the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Traditional glucagon kits consist of a glucagon powder that must be reconstituted with a liquid diluent and drawn into a syringe using a multi-step procedure that can be difficult to successfully administer, particularly in an emergency. In published comparative human factors studies with traditional glucagon kits, only 6% to 31% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose of glucagon. In other words, in these studies, test subjects failed to deliver the full dose of glucagon 69% to 94% of the time. The underuse or unsuccessful use of these traditional glucagon kits leaves people at risk of experiencing prolonged severe hypoglycemic events, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious health consequences and death. 
We believe Gvoke addresses the administration challenges of traditional glucagon kits and has the potential to be the preferred emergency glucagon product. Our ready-to-use Gvoke does not require reconstitution or refrigeration and features two-year room-temperature stable liquid glucagon delivered in a pre-filled syringe or an auto-injecting device with no visible needle. In our human factors studies, 99% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose with our ready-to-use Gvoke.
In addition to traditional glucagon kits, a nasally administered glucagon powder, Eli Lilly's BAQSIMITM, was approved by the FDA in July 2019 and was launched in August 2019. While BAQSIMI offers a novel route of administration, we believe patients and caregivers in the diabetic community want greater certainty that a full dose of glucagon will be delivered in an emergency situation and so will prefer Gvoke to BAQSIMI. 
Our goal is to establish Gvoke as the preferred emergency glucagon product and drive greater adoption and penetration of emergency glucagon therapy by offering a glucagon product that better meets the needs of patients and caregivers. The American Diabetes Association ("ADA") recommends that glucagon be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia for use in 
4

the event of an emergency. People with diabetes who are treated with insulin or substances that promote production of insulin are at increased risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia. There are an estimated 1.5 million people with T1D in the United States who are treated with insulin because their bodies do not naturally produce insulin, all of whom are clinically appropriate for glucagon. Approximately 4.7 million additional people with T2D in the United States are treated with insulin because their bodies do not use insulin properly, of which we estimate that approximately 50% are clinically appropriate for glucagon. Therefore, we estimate the potential target population for emergency glucagon therapy totals approximately 3.9 million people in the United States. Our commercial strategy is to penetrate this market efficiently with a concentrated sales force by targeting high prescribers of glucagon and mealtime insulin and to activate demand through targeted direct-to-patient promotion. We also plan to use our medical affairs and market access teams to actively drive market access and obtain payor coverage for Gvoke. The combination of our promotional efforts in this category and Eli Lilly’s in support of its BAQSIMI is expected to drive a significant increase in prescription activity for glucagon in general. In fact, since the introduction of Gvoke PFS in November 2019, total monthly glucagon prescriptions across all types and formulations have been higher by 25% or more over that same month’s prior year totals.
Due to the limitations of traditional glucagon kits and other factors, only approximately 567,200 total prescriptions for traditional glucagon kits were written in 2019 in the United States. In the second half of 2019, both BAQSIMI, which Eli Lilly launched in August 2019, and Gvoke PFS, which we launched in November 2019, entered the market. According to IQVIA, total prescriptions written in 2019 for BAQSIMI and Gvoke PFS were approximately 40,900 and 600, respectively. Total units reported in 2019 were approximately 906,700 traditional glucagon kits, 106,100 units of BAQSIMI, and 2,300 Gvoke units as adjusted for a consistent unit of measure. Based on our market research, we are targeting our marketing to all 3.9 million people that we believe are clinically appropriate for glucagon. In 2019, U.S. sales for emergency glucagon products were approximately $259 million, but we believe that increasing penetration, including by new entrants that address unmet patient and caregiver needs, such as Gvoke, may result in a potential sales opportunity of up to $2.2 billion. Outside of the United States, we estimate there are an additional 3.5 million people with diabetes in Europe and an additional 12.5 million people with diabetes in Japan and China that are clinically appropriate for emergency glucagon treatment. In November 2019, we submitted our MAA to the EMA for our liquid glucagon formulation for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes. If our MAA is approved, we could potentially launch our liquid glucagon formulation in certain European countries in 2021. We plan to pursue development and commercialization collaborations for most, if not all, of the non-U.S. markets we seek to enter.
We are also applying our glucagon formulation to certain intermittent and chronic use conditions with significant unmet medical need. In 2019, the following development programs either produced positive clinical trial results or advanced into clinical trials. We plan to continue to advance these programs going forward. These additional applications are: 

< | Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia ("PBH"), a serious complication of bariatric surgery that can arise from excessive insulin, or hyperinsulinism, due to the change in gastric anatomy resulting from bariatric surgery.
< | Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia ("EIH") in people with diabetes. Exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, often results in a significant drop in blood glucose levels for people on insulin. 
< | Management of diabetes via glucagon in a fully integrated, bi-hormonal artificial pancreas closed-loop system. 

By applying our ready-to-use glucagon to treat multiple conditions, we expect to leverage operating efficiencies across our supply chain, research and development, and commercial and medical organizations.
We have decided not to proceed with a planned Phase 3 Congenital Hyperinsulinism ("CHI") study based on the challenging regulatory pathway coupled with the limited market opportunity. Instead, we will consider requests to make our liquid-stable glucagon available for approved Expanded Access requests at no cost to eligible patients. Expanded Access is a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or serious disease to gain access to an investigational drug for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available.
In addition, we concluded our Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure ("HAAF") program based on results from our Phase 2 clinical trial in adult T1D subjects, as no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms were observed based on percent change in plasma epinephrine concentration from baseline. While there were positive epinephrine and improved hypoglycemia awareness responses observed in some subjects, the equivocal efficacy results observed may be explained by the incomplete elimination of time spent with hypoglycemia. 
We are also applying our technology platforms to develop additional product candidates, such as a fixed ratio co-formulation of pramlintide and insulin ("Pram-Insulin") for the management of diabetes and ready-to-use, liquid-stable diazepam delivered via a commercially available auto-injector for the emergency treatment of epileptic seizures. Additionally, based on the promising data seen in some of our early clinical trials as well as formulations in our laboratory, we believe we have the potential to advance a number of additional programs in additional indications and that our strong product candidate portfolio, complemented by external expansion opportunities, will support our vision to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of our target markets.
The nature of our product candidates and target conditions provides us with a potentially faster and capital-efficient development and regulatory pathway to approval. The FDA has granted orphan drug status to several indications for our product candidates, including our 
5

ready-to-use glucagon for PBH and CHI and our ready-to-use, liquid-stable formulation of diazepam for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and acute repetitive seizures, or ARS, in patients with epilepsy. Additionally, we have received orphan drug designation from the EMA for CHI and Noninsulinoma Pancreatogenous Hypoglycaemia Syndrome ("NIPHS"), which includes patients with PBH. 
In the United States, this designation provides us with research and development tax credits and exemption from FDA user fees, as well as seven years of orphan drug exclusivity upon product approval. In the European Union ("EU"), this designation provides us with ten years of market exclusivity upon product approval and a single MAA application to the EMA through centralized review and the potential for reduced regulatory review fees. In addition, because certain conditions that we intend to target are rare conditions, we believe our clinical trials may be of smaller size than studies for conditions that are not rare conditions. Furthermore, because the product candidates developed using our technology platforms are designed to be reformulations of currently approved products, in the United States, we expect to utilize the FDA’s pathway under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") which permits submissions to rely, in part, on the safety and effectiveness of a previously approved product, which may potentially result in a more expeditious pathway to FDA approval.
Our management team includes veterans in drug development, discovery and commercialization, with executive experience in leading global pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, including Durata Therapeutics, Baxter Healthcare, Merck, Searle, Takeda, Warner Chilcott, MedPointe Healthcare, Amgen, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, PowderJect Technologies and Alpharma.
Our Pipeline
The following table summarizes key information about our internal products and product candidates and anticipated milestones.
 * Additionally, we have available via Expanded Access, continuous infusion glucagon for Congenital Hyperinsulinism
** Orphan Drug Designation
Additionally, we have provided ready-to-use glucagon to Oregon Health & Science University ("OHSU") for their Phase 1 closed-loop dual-hormone artificial pancreas study. OHSU presented topline results at the ADA 79th Scientific Sessions and submitted results to a peer-reviewed journal in the fourth quarter of 2019. Based on the results, we plan to support advancement of OHSU and other artificial pancreas programs with ready-to-use glucagon.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to utilize our proprietary non-aqueous formulation technology platforms to convert marketed and development-stage products that have poor solubility and stability into ready-to-use, user-friendly injectable and infusible drugs for multiple therapeutic areas and conditions, including hypoglycemia, diabetes and epilepsy. We also seek to apply our formulation technology platforms to enhance the formulations of proprietary products and candidates of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The key elements of our strategy include:

< | Maximize the commercial potential for Gvoke. We commercially launched Gvoke PFS in the United States in November 2019 and expect Gvoke HypoPen to be commercially available in July 2020. We are initially targeting approximately 8,000 healthcare professionals who are high prescribers of traditional glucagon kits and/or mealtime insulin products, using an initial field team of 80 individuals, and activating demand through targeted direct-to-patient promotion. We have built our initial commercial organization and critical infrastructure, including individuals in operations, supply chain, pharmacovigilance, compliance, regulatory, marketing, sales leadership, market access and sales operations, as well as our medical affairs organization. 
< | Secure regulatory approval for our ready-to-use liquid stable glucagon in Europe. We submitted our MAA to the EMA in November 2019. We plan to pursue development and commercialization collaborations for most, if not all of the non-U.S. markets we seek to enter. If approved, we could launch our ready-to-use glucagon in certain European countries in 2021. 
< | Continue to advance our ready-to-use glucagon portfolio to address hypoglycemia associated with other conditions. We plan to apply our ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon to address multiple conditions that could benefit from intermittent or chronic administration, such as PBH as well as in diabetes for EIH. We are also evaluating our liquid-stable glucagon as the glucagon component of a fully integrated, bi-hormonal artificial pancreas. Through these programs, our primary goal is to secure FDA approval of a vial of our liquid glucagon for self-administration via a syringe or transfer to a pump reservoir for continuous infusion. We plan to leverage efficiencies across our portfolio, such as our supply chain, research and development, and our commercial and medical organizations. We plan to use commercially available drug delivery devices for our liquid-stable glucagon formulation and associated intermittent and chronic glucagon programs. 
< | Continue to leverage our technology and expertise to develop a portfolio of additional product candidates. We are exploring the application of our formulation technology platforms to other commercially available drugs for multiple conditions. We initiated and completed several preclinical studies of a fixed-ratio pramlintide-insulin co-formulation combination product for the treatment of diabetes and began a Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019. We expect topline results in the first half of 2020. In addition, we are developing an improved formulation of diazepam to be administered through a ready-to-use auto-injector for which we are evaluating indications such as the treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and ARS. In December 2018 we initiated a clinical study evaluating the preclinical pharmacokinetic ("PK") and pharmacodynamics ("PD") of our ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid diazepam formulation in normal volunteers and announced positive results in May 2019. Based on these results, we initiated an additional Phase 1b weight-based study in the second half of 2019 and expect topline results in the first half of 2020. Finally, we have advanced several additional programs to formulation stage and expect these to complete preclinical development over the next year.
< | Collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to apply our technology platforms to enhance the formulations of their proprietary products and candidates. We are pursuing formulation and development partnerships to apply our XeriSol and XeriJect technology platforms to enhance the formulation, delivery and clinical profile of other companies’ proprietary drugs and biologics. We currently are working with some major pharmaceutical companies on feasibility programs to evaluate the formulation of their proprietary therapeutics with XeriSol or XeriJect. We plan to continue to explore the application of our formulation technology platforms to proprietary drugs and biologics from additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 

Our Technology Platforms
Overview
Our proprietary non-aqueous formulation technology platforms are designed to address the challenges presented by current aqueous formulations of certain drugs. Injectable pharmaceuticals have conventionally used aqueous delivery systems to administer drugs and biologics, but, in the presence of water, many drugs have poor solubility and low stability. To optimize their stability and enable longer-term storage, many of these products are freeze dried into a powder and, when needed, must be reconstituted with a liquid diluent, which is often a challenging multi-step procedure with the potential for error. Furthermore, the drug product begins to break down once combined with water, which requires the drug to be used immediately or otherwise refrigerated. In addition, these products can require complicated formulations and large injection volumes to make them soluble. For many products, these volumes are too large for SC or IM delivery and instead necessitate IV infusion over several hours. These drugs can be difficult or painful to administer and have limited portability, resulting in an overall poor experience for patients and caregivers.
Our proprietary XeriSol and XeriJect platforms offer the opportunity to eliminate the need for reconstitution and refrigeration, enable long-term room-temperature stability, significantly reduce injection volume and allow for a more convenient SC or IM administration 
7

as opposed to IV infusion, all of which we believe are distinct advantages over existing aqueous formulations of marketed products and development-stage product candidates. We believe that our technology platforms can lead to products that will improve outcomes and enable easier administration while reducing costs for payors and the healthcare system.
Our XeriJect formulation platform is best suited for drugs and biologics consisting of large molecules, such as proteins, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. XeriSol is best suited for peptides and small molecules that currently encounter formulation challenges. With XeriJect, we have formulated suspensions with a protein concentration in excess of 400 mg/mL, far exceeding current aqueous formulation systems with maximum achievable protein concentrations of 50-250 mg/mL. These biocompatible non-aqueous, injectable solutions or suspensions formulated using our technology platforms can then be packaged for administration in a commercially available auto-injector, pre-filled syringe, vial, multi-dose pen or infusion pump.
Ready-to-Use Glucagon
Our novel, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon formulation represents a significant advancement over freeze-dried, or lyophilized, glucagon, enabling a ready-to-use solution that can be quickly and easily injected or infused subcutaneously. This formulation is designed to provide the flexibility to dose different volumes of liquid glucagon using a range of delivery devices to suit the needs of people with hypoglycemic conditions. We believe our ready-to-use glucagon has the potential to change the paradigm for treatment of hypoglycemic conditions and improve the lives of people who experience hypoglycemia.
Our Products
Gvoke
Gvoke offers a ready-to-use, room-temperature stable glucagon that is designed to be administered subcutaneously in a simple two-step process via a commercially available pre-filled syringe or auto-injector. In our human factors studies, 99% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose with either Gvoke PFS or Gvoke HypoPen. Conversely, in published human factors studies of traditional emergency liquid glucagon kits, only 6% to 31% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose. We believe we can establish Gvoke as the preferred emergency glucagon product and drive greater adoption and penetration of emergency glucagon therapy for patients and caregivers. Gvoke was approved by the FDA on September 10, 2019. We began the commercial launch of Gvoke PFS in November 2019. Gvoke PFS is available in two doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and a 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. We expect Gvoke HypoPen will be commercially available in July 2020, in the same doses as the Gvoke PFS.
Additionally, we submitted our MAA to the EMA in November 2019. We are currently evaluating plans to submit Gvoke for regulatory approval in Canada and other countries. We have a clinical trial application in place with Health Canada to allow the inclusion of Canadian clinical research sites in certain of our U.S. clinical trials related to Gvoke. 
Hypoglycemia Background
Diabetes is a widespread condition that affects an estimated 425 million people worldwide with an estimated 22.1 million drug-treated people in the United States. Among people with diabetes in the United States, all of the approximately 1.5 million people with T1D and 4.7 million people with T2D require insulin therapy to lower their blood glucose levels to achieve normal blood sugar levels and avoid hyperglycemia. Conversely, insulin treatment in people with diabetes can also lead to hypoglycemia, a deficiency of glucose in the bloodstream, which is more common in people with diabetes who are treated with insulin or substances that promote production of insulin. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention highlighted diabetes agent-associated hypoglycemia as one of its three primary concerns because of the severity and increasing prevalence of the problem. In 2017, the ADA stated that hypoglycemia remains the major limiting factor in the glycemic management of T1D and T2D.
Hypoglycemia is categorized by level of severity, expressed as mild, moderate or severe hypoglycemic events. Definitions, symptoms and treatment recommendations for hypoglycemia per the ADA and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ("AACE") are summarized in the figure below:
8

Hypoglycemic events of any severity are a daily concern for people with diabetes. Severe hypoglycemic events are extremely frightening for patients and caregivers and can result in cardiovascular disease, seizure, coma, and, if left untreated, death. Fear of hypoglycemia and the morbidity and mortality risks associated with it are a constant reality for people with diabetes. According to scientific literature, fear of hypoglycemia is a critical impediment to psychological well-being and quality of life and represents the greatest barrier to optimal glycemic control. Studies have shown that only 14% of those aged 18–25 years and 29% of those aged 26–50 years achieved optimal glycemic control by taking insulin.
The ADA recommends that glucagon be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose <54 mg/dL, for use in the event of an emergency. Glucagon works to raise the glucose levels in a person’s blood by inducing the liver to convert glycogen, a type of stored sugar in the body, into glucose.
While patients can take preventive measures, hypoglycemic events still occur. On average, people with T1D experience an episode of mild or moderate hypoglycemia twice per week and 30% to 40% of people with T1D experience one to two episodes of severe hypoglycemia per year. On average, half of people with T2D treated with insulin experience an episode of mild or moderate hypoglycemia twice per month. People with T2D treated with insulin are also at risk of severe hypoglycemia, and approximately 21% of these individuals experience an episode of severe hypoglycemia at least once annually.
Limitations of Existing Emergency Liquid Glucagon Kits
Because of the urgent nature of severe hypoglycemia, the majority of severe hypoglycemic events are treated on an emergency basis, outside of a healthcare facility. On September 10, 2019, Gvoke was approved by the FDA, and we commenced the commercial launch of Gvoke PFS in November 2019. In July 2019, a nasally administered glucagon powder, Eli Lilly's BAQSIMI, was approved and is currently being marketed in the U.S. Prior to this, there were only two emergency glucagon products available to treat severe hypoglycemia: Eli Lilly’s Glucagon Emergency Kit ("GEK") and Novo Nordisk’s GlucaGen® HypoKit®. Each of these products is sold as a vial of lyophilized, glucagon powder with an exposed needle/syringe that contains a liquid diluent. The glucagon powder must be combined with the liquid diluent at the time of use and drawn into a syringe in accordance with a complex multi-step reconstitution and dose calibration procedure. Long-term storage of the combined solution is impractical because once the lyophilized glucagon is combined with water, the solution becomes unstable and can fibrillate, rendering it inactive and potentially toxic. The multi-step reconstitution and dose calibration procedure required for traditional glucagon kits can be intimidating, particularly in an emergency situation, for likely glucagon kit users, a group that includes caregivers, co-workers, friends, teachers or other bystanders.
In 2018, we conducted a quantitative study with 700 caregivers and people with diabetes evaluating the market perceptions of traditional glucagon kits, which we refer to as our Caregiver and Patient Perceptions Study. In that study, only one third of respondents had a highly favorable opinion of the traditional kits and only half were confident that a glucagon kit user would be able to correctly administer the traditional emergency glucagon products. Furthermore, in three published comparative human factors studies with traditional kits, only 6% to 31% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose of glucagon. In other words, in these studies, test subjects failed to deliver the full dose of glucagon 69% to 94% of the time. Accordingly, a diabetes patient experiencing a severe hypoglycemic episode who relies on a bystander to administer glucagon may not receive the full dose of glucagon needed to restore their blood glucose levels. Failure to promptly treat severe hypoglycemia leaves the person at critical risk of irreversible brain damage and heart problems, especially in people who already have coronary artery disease. If emergency medical treatment is not successful, the severe hypoglycemic event can be fatal.
In 2019, Eli Lilly's GEK and BAQSIMI represented approximately 68% and 11% of U.S. sales, respectively, and Novo Nordisk's GlucaGen HypoKit represented approximately 20% of U.S. sales.
Xeris Gvoke Key Features and Benefits
Leveraging our patented XeriSol technology, we believe Gvoke offers an important advancement in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Gvoke is the first ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon product approved that can be administered via a pre-filled syringe (Gvoke PFS) or auto-injector (Gvoke HypoPen). Gvoke PFS is currently available in two doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and a 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. We expect Gvoke HypoPen will be available in July 2020, in the same doses as the Gvoke PFS. These innovative formats are designed to provide the reliability of a ready-to-use liquid glucagon while making it easier for patients or caregivers to administer quickly and simply. We have designed Gvoke to be easy to administer.

The key features of Gvoke PFS and Gvoke HypoPen are:

< | Ready-to-use: With its easy two-step administration process, the user of Gvoke PFS simply pulls off the cap, inserts the needle at a 90-degree angle and pushes the plunger down as far as it will go, or with Gvoke HypoPen, pulls off the cap and pushes down on the skin for five seconds until the viewing window turns red. There is no reconstitution required at the time of emergency.
< | Easy-to-use: In our human factors studies, 99% of users were able to successfully administer the full dose. 
< | No dose calibration required: Gvoke is offered in two pre-measured doses, 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. 
< | Two-year room-temperature stability: No refrigeration is required at any time. 

In addition, key features specific to the Gvoke HypoPen are:

< | No visible needle: The needle in the Gvoke HypoPen is not visible to the user.
< | Auto-retraction: The needle auto-retracts after administration for safety. 
< | Auto-locks: The device auto-locks after use for safety. 

In contrast to traditional glucagon kits and the nasal glucagon powder, Gvoke features the following benefits:
In our Caregiver and Patient Perceptions Study conducted in 2018, more than 75% of subjects responded that they would prefer Gvoke HypoPen over the then-existing traditionally available glucagon kits. Also in 2018, we conducted a quantitative study of over 400 healthcare professionals, which we refer to as our Healthcare Professional Perceptions Study. In that study, results indicated that glucagon would be prescribed to more people across all clinically appropriate patient segments if Gvoke HypoPen was available. Based on this market research, we believe that the glucagon market will become more penetrated and that Gvoke HypoPen will become the preferred emergency glucagon delivery solution.
Xeris Gvoke Market Potential
Based on current market data as well as our Caregiver and Patient and Healthcare Professional Perceptions Studies, we believe that Gvoke has the opportunity to increase penetration of the glucagon market in severe hypoglycemia by increasing the number of people with diabetes who have a filled glucagon prescription and by increasing the number of glucagon rescue devices they have on hand.

There are approximately 22.1 million drug-treated people with diabetes in the United States, and the compound annual growth rate in incidence of diagnosed and treated people with diabetes is approximately 4% per year. An additional 84 million people in the United States are pre-diabetic and may progress to T2D. The ADA recommends that glucagon be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia for use in the event of an emergency. Based on our Healthcare Professional Perceptions Study, we believe almost all people with T1D and approximately 50% of people with T2D on insulin are considered clinically appropriate for glucagon. In the United States, there is an estimated 1.5 million people with T1D who are treated with insulin because their bodies do not naturally produce insulin and approximately 4.7 million additional people with T2D who are treated with insulin because their bodies do not use insulin properly. In the aggregate, we estimate that the potential target population for emergency glucagon therapy totals approximately 3.9 million people in the United States. We are currently offering Gvoke PFS in packages of one or two pre-filled syringes Based on responses from our market research studies, most buyers would be expected to purchase, on average, two syringes or pens per person. We believe by increasing penetration into the market for emergency glucagon kits and based on the current price of approximately $280 per unit for traditional emergency glucagon products, the U.S. potential sales opportunity may be up to $2.2 billion.
Despite the risk of experiencing a severe hypoglycemic event, we believe that emergency glucagon therapy is under-appreciated, under-evaluated and under-taught, resulting in a market that is underpenetrated. According to a 2015 study published in the journal Endocrine Practice, approximately 50% of people with T1D and approximately 3% of people with T2D with a new insulin prescription had a filled glucagon prescription. We believe that the drawbacks of traditional kits and the lack of conversations regarding glucagon limit their adoption. Two of the top reasons given by people with diabetes for non-renewal of glucagon prescriptions were that they were not confident that a caregiver or other person would be able to correctly administer the kit, and their healthcare professional did not discuss the need for a new one with them. In the United States, approximately 567,200 total prescriptions for emergency glucagon kits were written in 2019 in the United States, resulting in the purchase of approximately 906,700 single-dose kits. In 2019, U.S. sales for emergency glucagon products totaled approximately $259 million. 
In our Healthcare Professional Perceptions Study, results indicated that glucagon would be prescribed to more people across all clinically appropriate patient segments if our Gvoke HypoPen were available. Similarly, in our Caregiver and Patient Perceptions Study, almost two-thirds of people with T1D and T2D who use insulin said they would proactively ask for a prescription for Gvoke HypoPen if available. Importantly, over half of those same people do not currently have a filled glucagon prescription. During an emergency hypoglycemic event, these individuals would often be required to seek treatment through ambulance calls, hospital admissions or office visits. We believe that these studies show that more people would want to have emergency glucagon on-hand if there was a product that better met their needs. We believe this represents an opportunity for Gvoke to shift the site of care from the emergency room or hospital to less costly settings such as the home.
Outside the United States, we estimate that an additional 3.5 million people with diabetes in Europe and an additional 12.5 million people with diabetes in Japan and China are clinically appropriate for glucagon treatment. However, in 2018, only approximately 733,000 emergency glucagon products were sold in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain combined, and only approximately 414,000 were sold in Japan and China combined, which we believe indicates that the market for emergency glucagon products is significantly underpenetrated in those regions.
Commercial Strategy
We will seek to replace traditional emergency glucagon kits with Gvoke, increase the number of at-risk people who carry emergency glucagon and promote access to emergency glucagon products. While our sales force and medical teams expect to focus on driving awareness and adoption of Gvoke by healthcare professionals, we believe accelerated growth and expanded uptake will come from targeted direct-to-patient messaging that, because the majority of people with diabetes are concentrated in 15 states, will allow us to efficiently and effectively reach our target audience.
11

We launched Gvoke PFS in November 2019, and we expect Gvoke HypoPen to be commercially available in July 2020. Our strategy for Gvoke includes the following: 

< | Drive awareness and adoption of Gvoke. We plan to drive awareness and adoption of Gvoke to replace traditional emergency glucagon kits in the market. 
 | o | Healthcare Professionals: Having recently launched Gvoke, we are targeting high glucagon prescribing healthcare professionals. Approximately 3,000 healthcare professionals issue about 50% of current glucagon prescriptions. We intend to reach these professionals using our initial sales representatives. 
 | o | Patients and Caregivers: We intend to activate patient advocacy organizations and leverage channels such as direct-to-consumer tactics, social media, digital presence, traditional offline channels and press coverage to drive awareness and communicate our value proposition to patients and caregivers. Because we do not have the first product to market in a competitive landscape, we plan to increase our spend on direct-to-consumer tactics. Epidemiology and census data indicate that 15 states account for almost 60% of people with diabetes, allowing us to be efficient and effective with our promotional activities.
< | Penetrate the market. We believe that the Gvoke market is currently significantly underpenetrated due to the lack of, and limitations in, current treatment options. We have designed Gvoke to offer healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers a ready-to-use alternative that facilitates administration of the full dose of glucagon every time it is used. We believe this product offering, paired with our commercial focus, has the potential to grow the market in two ways: 
 | o | Healthcare Professionals: In addition to the approximately 3,000 healthcare professionals who issue about half of the current glucagon prescriptions, we are targeting approximately 5,000 healthcare professionals who are high mealtime insulin prescribers but who are not high prescribers of glucagon. We hired an initial field team of 80 individuals to reach these professionals. 
 | o | Patients and Caregivers: We believe there is an opportunity to activate patient and caregiver demand for Gvoke. Gvoke is designed as an easy-to-use solution for a segment of patients and caregivers who currently lack the confidence in administering traditional emergency glucagon kits and would rather rely on emergency responders for treatment. 
< | Promote access. Traditional emergency glucagon kits have favorable market access, and current trends indicate a relatively low level of management of these products by payors. For example, Eli Lilly’s GEK is covered at or above 80% with unrestricted access across commercial, Medicare, Managed Medicaid and State Medicaid plans. A Diabetes Health Coverage: State Laws and Programs report reviewing state insurance mandated coverage, Medicaid coverage and state-sponsored diabetes programs showed that 46 states and the District of Columbia have a diabetes statutory mandate for coverage, whether as medication or supply. Of our target patient population, approximately 50% are commercially insured, one-third are covered by Medicaid and approximately 15% are covered by Medicare. However, gaining market access and formulary coverage for new products takes substantial time and resources. As a result, we plan to increase our focus on promoting access to Gvoke. We have engaged with payors to more fully understand their drivers and barriers and convey the health and pharmacoeconomic value of Gvoke.

We have established a distribution channel in the United States for the commercialization of Gvoke. Gvoke PFS is currently being sold to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who, in turn, sell Gvoke PFS to pharmacies and other customers. We use a third-party logistics provider for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration, order management and chargeback processing and accounts receivable management. Outside of the United States, we plan to collaborate with local companies. 
Our Product Candidates
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Hypoglycemia Associated with Intermittent and Chronic Conditions
We are applying our ready-to-use liquid-stable glucagon formulation to treat other intermittent and chronic conditions with significant unmet medical need. In particular, our formulation may be applied to conditions requiring continuous doses or smaller "mini-doses" of glucagon over a longer administration period. We intend to leverage work across our programs to substantially reduce development costs for each indication and enable expanded uses for intermittent and chronic applications of ready-to-use glucagon to follow Gvoke. Development aspects that can be leveraged include:

< | Chemistry, manufacturing and controls ("CMC")
< | Nonclinical toxicology program 
< | Clinical supplies manufacturing 

For intermittent and chronic hypoglycemic conditions, we intend to leverage our completed preclinical studies across our glucagon portfolio, which consist of five toxicology studies in rats (up to 26 weeks), three toxicology studies in pigs (up to 39 weeks), one tolerability study in rabbits, three PK studies in rats, and four PK studies in minipigs. These preclinical studies demonstrated the safety of the ready-to-use glucagon and supported further clinical development. We have been awarded a $1.0 million grant from the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust for preclinical studies of glucagon product candidates for sub-chronic/chronic conditions.
12

For commercialization of ready-to-use glucagon for certain intermittent and chronic conditions, we expect to target endocrinologists, diabetologists and primary care providers that are currently prescribing glucagon and rapid acting insulin. Many of these physicians, particularly endocrinologists, are also currently treating PBH patients and we believe there is significant overlap between these physicians and those who would prescribe ready-to-use glucagon for diabetes.
In December 2013, we filed an IND application for the use of ready-to-use glucagon delivered via a wearable patch pump. This IND has supported our clinical development efforts in PBH and an assessment in a bi-hormonal artificial pancreas closed-loop system. We are the sponsor of this IND, which is active as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia
We are developing a ready-to-use glucagon formulation for chronic self-administration in PBH, a challenging complication of bariatric surgery that may significantly impair quality of life, but for which there are currently no approved treatments. In January 2018, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for our ready-to-use glucagon for the treatment of patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, of which PBH is a category. In November 2018, we received EU orphan product designation for the treatment of NIPHS which includes patients with PBH. 
Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia Market
Obesity and related comorbidities such as T2D and cardiovascular disease are increasingly recognized as a major threat to individual and public health, with sustained weight loss difficult to achieve. Clinicians and patients alike have embraced the results of recent controlled clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of surgical procedures performed on the stomach or intestines, known as bariatric surgery, to not only induce sustained weight loss but also to improve or normalize obesity-related comorbidities, including T2D. The number of bariatric surgeries performed in the United States has increased substantially from an estimated 158,000 procedures per year in 2011 to 252,000 in 2018. While benefits of bariatric surgery are now achieved with a lower risk of surgical complications, longer-term intestinal and nutritional complications can still occur.
One challenging and sometimes severe complication of bariatric surgery is hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, and more specifically PBH, is most commonly associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ("RYGB"), a procedure in which the small intestine is re-routed to a small resected stomach pouch. However, PBH has also been observed following sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure that reduces the size of the stomach. In the U.S., approximately 20% of bariatric procedures performed are RYGB, while approximately 60% are sleeve gastrectomy. PBH is defined as documented plasma glucose levels below 70 mg/dL in conjunction with hypoglycemic symptoms and the relief of such symptoms with the normalization of glucose levels. Symptoms include palpitations, lightheadedness and sweating. A subset of post-bariatric surgery patients develops very severe hypoglycemia involving a shortage of glucose in the brain, known as neuroglycopenic symptoms, typically occurring one to three years following bariatric surgery and associated with confusion, decreased attentiveness, seizure and loss of consciousness. For these patients, quality of life can be severely affected as many cannot care for themselves or even be left alone and may ultimately lose their employment due to this disability.
Hypoglycemia typically occurs after meals, particularly those rich in simple carbohydrates. Due to the change in gastric anatomy resulting from bariatric surgery, plasma insulin concentrations are inappropriately high after meals, which can lead to severe hypoglycemia in these patients. Treatment of hypoglycemia requires rapid-acting carbohydrates such as glucose tablets, which in PBH patients can contribute to rebound hyperglycemia that triggers further insulin secretion and recurrent hypoglycemia.
There are currently no approved treatments for PBH. Current strategies to manage PBH include dietary modification aimed at reducing intake of high glycemic index carbohydrates. Both diet and off-label administration of pre-meal acarbose, an anti-diabetic drug used to treat T2D, aim to minimize rapid post-meal surges in glucose that trigger insulin secretion. Additional off-label therapies include those aimed at reducing insulin secretion. In severe cases, gastric restriction or banding has been required to slow gastric emptying, and gastrostomy tubes have been used to provide the sole source of nutrition. Despite strict adherence to medical nutrition therapy and clinical use of multiple medical options, patients continue to have frequent hypoglycemia. While hypoglycemia most commonly occurs following meals, it can also occur in response to increased activity and emotional stress. Importantly, patient safety is additionally compromised when hypoglycemia unawareness develops with recurrent hypoglycemia. We believe there is an urgent need for therapeutic options to allow optimal nutrition, maintain health and quality of life and improve safety in patients with PBH.
Because episodes of hypoglycemia normally occur in the ambulatory setting, the reported prevalence of PBH varies, but we estimate that roughly 1% to 2% of bariatric surgery patients experience PBH. As bariatric procedures have been performed for over ten years, based on our analysis of market research, we estimate a standing population of approximately 85,000 patients who fail mealtime nutritional therapy and experience PBH in the United States and require additional treatment options. A similar size patient population is estimated to exist in Europe. Depending on the severity of their condition, these patients may require chronic episodic administration of glucagon ranging from multiple times a month to multiple times a day.

Xeris Offering–Ready-to-Use Glucagon for PBH
We have developed a ready-to-use glucagon formulation that can be easily and quickly injected or infused subcutaneously from a syringe, pen or pump. Injection of small doses of our liquid-stable glucagon after meals may offer a novel mechanism for PBH patients to treat or prevent hypoglycemia. Importantly, these smaller and more physiologic doses are designed to prevent rebound hyperglycemia associated with glucose tablets, carbohydrate intake and rescue doses of glucagon. Further, small doses of glucagon may offer a direct treatment mechanism for PBH, as opposed to indirect methods aimed at preventing hypoglycemia that are currently employed using various off-label therapeutic options.
Primary market research has shown endocrinologists are comfortable with glucagon’s mechanism of action and current safety profile and view ready-to-use glucagon as a welcome treatment option for PBH patients. Physicians surveyed reported ready-to-use glucagon utilization of 68% to 97% if the product can prevent half of severe hypoglycemic events in PBH patients.
As there are currently no therapeutic options indicated for treatment of PBH and the condition has been designated a rare disease, we believe that payors will include our ready-to-use glucagon on their formularies, if approved. We intend to conduct additional payor research as product development progresses.
From 2015 to 2017, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), awarded us $1.8 million in Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research ("SBIR") grants to demonstrate the potential benefits of ready-to-use glucagon in these patients. Collaborators on this grant included endocrinologists at the Joslin Diabetes Center and device engineers at the Harvard University John R. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science.
Clinical Experience in PBH
We have completed a proof-of-concept clinical trial and a randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial for our ready-to-use glucagon for the treatment of PBH. A new IND application for self-administration of our ready-to-use glucagon with a vial/syringe went into effect on October 19, 2018. This IND authorized us to initiate an additional Phase 2 trial evaluating our ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon formulation for patients who experience hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after bariatric surgery. We dosed the first patient in this clinical trial in the second half of 2019 and received topline in-clinic results in December 2019. We expect the results from this trial, including the ongoing outpatient phase, will help enable the evaluation of ready-to-use glucagon in a future Phase 3 clinical trial using a vial/syringe. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trials
XSGO-PB01: A Phase 2 Proof-Of-Concept Study of Sensor Guided, Clinician-Administered Delivery of Glucagon Infusion from a Patch Pump to Prevent Post-Prandial Hypoglycemia in Post-Bariatric Surgery Patients
We conducted an iterative design-and-evaluation Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the performance of a novel event-based hypoglycemia prediction algorithm that triggered delivery of mini-doses of ready-to-use glucagon from a patch pump. For the trial, which was conducted from the first quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017, we recruited seven patients 18 to 65 years of age with a history of RYGB surgery and PBH with neuroglycopenia who were uncontrolled on medical nutrition therapy and medications. In an inpatient setting, subjects received a mixed-meal tolerance test ("MMTT"), which is known to cause hypoglycemia in these patients. Upon receipt of an alarm based on continuous glucose monitor data, subjects were given small, subcutaneous infusions of ready-to-use glucagon from a pump, with the aim of preventing hypoglycemia. The primary endpoint of this study was to investigate the ability of the patch pump to detect and direct timing of glucose administration. The secondary endpoint of this study was to investigate the safety profile of ready-to-use glucagon administered from a pump.
Ready-to-use glucagon bolus through the infusion pump was observed to rapidly raise serum glucagon levels, and the doses employed were not associated with increased insulin or C-peptide concentrations. Nadir glucose and time spent under 75 mg/dL in the period after the glucagon bolus were reduced progressively with each new stage of protocol development, which involved implementing either earlier hypoglycemia alarms or larger glucagon doses. All seven patients successfully completed nine treatment visits in this trial. Results showed the treatment to be well-tolerated, with discomfort at the infusion site and erythema the most frequent adverse events, and no severe adverse events.
Since this was the first implementation of the ready-to-use glucagon formulation in mini-doses for PBH, the dose was chosen with caution to prevent rebound hyperglycemia that has been observed with use of rescue doses of glucagon. Using these results, we determined the dose required to effectively prevent hypoglycemic events in the postprandial setting. The results of this trial were published in the peer-reviewed journal Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics.
XSGO-PB02: Closed-Loop Glucagon Pump for Treatment of Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia
Following the positive proof-of-concept outcome of XSGO-PB01, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of ready-to-use glucagon to prevent and treat hypoglycemia occurring 
14

in patients with PBH in response to meals. The primary objective of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of a closed-loop glucagon pump for PBH measured by real-time continuous glucose monitoring ("CGM"). Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability. Following an MMTT, subjects were randomized to either placebo or glucagon infusion on the first study visit and crossed over to the other treatment during the second treatment visit. Investigators were masked to subject assignment. In study visits, an MMTT was employed and subjects were treated based on CGM-based measurements of low blood glucose. Subjects were treated with study drug (ready-to-use glucagon or placebo) at a dose of 300 mcg followed by 150 mcg if needed. Of the 12 subjects that completed the trial, seven experienced severe hypoglycemia in response to an MMTT. Ready-to-use glucagon effectively treated hypoglycemia in comparison to placebo (p = 0.0082 glucagon vs. placebo). Rescue glucose was needed in 7 of 7 visits for subjects who received placebo and 0 of 7 visits for subjects who received ready-to-use glucagon. Both drug and placebo were well tolerated with no reported severe adverse events. An abstract of these study results was presented at the 2019 Endocrine Society annual meeting and full results were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. 
This randomized controlled trial data supported the new IND and informed the design of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial using a vial/syringe to evaluate ready-to-use glucagon in PBH. 
XSGR-PBH-201: A Phase 2, Interventional, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study of Glucagon RTU in Subjects Who Experience Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia After Bariatric Surgery 
Following our IND clearance in October 2018, we initiated a new Phase 2 clinical trial at five clinical research centers in North America. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover comparison in a Clinical Research Center ("CRC") setting followed by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two arm parallel comparison in the outpatient setting. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the logistics of implementing an efficacy and safety study of ready-to-use glucagon ("Glucagon RTU") via vial/syringe to treat symptomatic postprandial hypoglycemia in subjects with PBH. The study will also collect safety and efficacy information to help inform a future Phase 3 clinical trial. 
During the CRC crossover stage, subjects underwent two high-carbohydrate, solid/liquid-meal tests. After each meal, subjects self-administered blinded study drug (Glucagon RTU 300 mcg or placebo) when any postprandial autonomic symptom was experienced or when hypoglycemia was confirmed with a blood glucose measurement of less than 70 mg/dL using a blood glucose meter. After CRC study-related procedures were completed, subjects were assigned the blinded study drug (Glucagon RTU 300 mcg or placebo) and entered the 12-week outpatient stage. Subjects also were trained to self-administer their assigned study treatment, with the presence of any postprandial autonomic symptoms. 
The Phase 2 trial will evaluate blood glucose recovery ( > 70 mg/dL) at 15 minutes after dosing with Glucagon RTU and placebo. Safety, tolerability and quality-of-life are also assessed. The trial is comprised of 12 evaluable subjects. 
We reported topline results from the completed CRC crossover stage of this trial in December 2019, which demonstrated that most subjects experienced postprandial hypoglycemia within 90-120 minutes after finishing the meal. Of patients that successfully completed the meal challenge, all subjects were also able to self-administer 300 mcg (a "mini-dose") of the study drug, as directed, during the setting of declining blood glucose. A mini-dose of Glucagon RTU was adequate to restore or maintain normal blood glucose levels within 15 minutes of administration. This effect was maintained at 30 minutes, and hyperglycemia was not observed. The incidence of a follow-on episode of hypoglycemia (rebound hypoglycemia) requiring oral glucose for rescue was less with Glucagon RTU compared to placebo. Treatment emergent adverse events with mini-doses of Glucagon RTU were comparable to placebo, including negligible injection site reactions. Mini-doses of Glucagon RTU appear well tolerated, and no serious adverse events occurred. This study is currently ongoing in the outpatient stage, where both subjects and investigators remain blinded.
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia in Diabetes
Exercise-induced hypoglycemia and the complexity of management aimed at its prevention represent major barriers to the adoption of regular physical activity for many individuals with diabetes treated with insulin. Although carbohydrate ingestion, including oral glucose tablets, can help ameliorate hypoglycemia, patients’ carbohydrate requirements can be as high as 1 gram per minute of exercise, which can be counterproductive to weight management. Aerobic exercise, in particular, often results in a significant drop in blood glucose concentrations. Qualitative feedback has shown that the challenges in current exercise management strategies and the need to consume carbohydrates are frustrating and may lead to minimized or complete omission of exercise for many patients. People with diabetes who are on intensive insulin regimens are at risk of EIH. We believe there is a subset of these individuals that exercises at least three times per week per current guidelines, who could potentially use a mini-dose of ready-to-use glucagon each time they exercise. If approved, our ready-to-use glucagon would represent a significant market opportunity in the treatment for EIH.
15

Xeris Offering—Mini-doses of Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Treatment of EIH
We are developing a mini-dose of our ready-to-use, liquid-stable glucagon and have observed appropriate dose-dependent PK and PD responses when administered subcutaneously at doses of 75, 150 and 300 µg in adults with T1D. A proof-of-concept study further demonstrated that a mini-dose of 150 µg of glucagon prevented non-severe hypoglycemia to a substantially similar degree as oral glucose tablets that are commonly used during exercise to prevent or correct non-severe hypoglycemia in adults with T1D. As such, the use of mini-dose glucagon enabled patients to avoid the unnecessary caloric intake inherent in glucose tablets or other types of carbohydrates.
There currently are no FDA-approved glucagon products which enable individuals to modestly increase glucagon levels at the start of exercise, since current commercially available liquid glucagon kits are unstable in aqueous solution for extended periods of time. Glucagon rescue kits exist as a lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted in diluent immediately prior to injection and are only indicated at an emergency dose of 1 mg for rescue from severe hypoglycemia. Despite the challenging reconstitution process, there has been significant documented off-label use, in which patients with T1D mini-dose glucagon using the traditional glucagon kits. In addition, Eli Lilly’s BAQSIMI is a one-time use intranasal powder, the administration of which delivers a full 3 mg rescue dose of glucagon.
We have been awarded $2.1 million in grants from organizations such as the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust and the NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and we have worked with institutions including the Joslin Diabetes Center and the University of Pennsylvania for clinical development of our mini-dose glucagon product candidate.
Clinical Experience
We have successfully completed a number of preclinical studies in multiple species to support the safety of mini-dose glucagon, as well as Phase 2 safety and efficacy clinical trials in subjects with T1D.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials
XSMP-203: The Use of Mini-Dose Glucagon to Prevent Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes
Based on previous dose-finding trials (XSMP-201 and XSMP-202), we collaborated on a third Phase 2 clinical trial of mini-dose glucagon for EIH in the first quarter of 2016. The primary analysis of this trial was comparison of the glycemic response of 150 µg mini-dose glucagon against current standards of care, including basal insulin reduction and glucose tablet consumption, to mitigate exercise-induced hypoglycemia. In particular, this was a four-session, randomized crossover trial involving 15 adults with T1D who exercised at 50-55% VO2max for 45 minutes under conditions of no intervention (control), 50% basal insulin reduction, 40 g oral glucose tablets, or 150 µg subcutaneous mini-dose glucagon, all administered five minutes before exercise. Secondary endpoints were to investigate the safety profile of this product candidate.
During the exercise sessions conducted in this study, plasma glucose increased slightly with mini-dose glucagon compared to a decrease with control and insulin reduction, as depicted in the figure below. Plasma glucose increased more greatly with glucose tablets. Hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) was experienced by six subjects during control, five during insulin reduction and none with glucose tablets or mini-dose glucagon; however, five subjects experienced hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) with glucose tablets and one with mini-dose glucagon. The study was well-controlled, as insulin levels were not different among sessions, while glucagon levels increased only in the mini-dose glucagon arm, as expected.
In a Phase 2a randomized, controlled clinical study, T1D subjects (n=16) administered mini-dose glucagon completed a 45-minute exercise session without adjusting basal insulin or ingesting glucose tabs (calories).
16

The Phase 2a study concluded that mini-dose glucagon (150 µg) may have the potential to prevent EIH in adults with T1D. In addition, mini-dose glucagon may be more effective at preventing EIH than insulin reduction which was associated with a similar rate and magnitude of hypoglycemia as no intervention. Moreover, while mini-dose glucagon was as effective as glucose tablets for preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia, mini-dose glucagon may result in less post-intervention hyperglycemia than ingestion of carbohydrates and avoids the consumption of unnecessary calories. The results of this study were published in the journal Diabetes Care. 
Ongoing Trials 
XSMP-204: A Phase 2 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel Study to Evaluate Glucagon RTU (Glucagon Injection) Compared to Standard of Care for the Prevention of Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia During Regular Aerobic Exercise in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes 
This trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover comparison in a clinical research center (CRC) setting, followed by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind two-arm comparison with a third open-label arm in an outpatient setting to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of RTU glucagon to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia (EIH) in adults with T1D who perform regular, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise. T1D subjects who receive daily insulin treatment via a subcutaneous infusion pump will perform at least 45 minutes duration of exercise in a CRC setting and at least 30 minutes duration of moderate-to-high intensity exercise in the outpatient setting and will be monitored for hypoglycemia in the exercise recovery period. In January 2020, Xeris reported positive results from the CRC setting of this Phase 2 study. Results showed that a mini-dose of RTU glucagon was adequate to maintain normal blood glucose levels during prolonged, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise. The outpatient stage, where subjects will be exercising on their own at home, is currently ongoing with results expected in the first half of 2020. This stage of the trial is examining if the subcutaneous administration of RTU glucagon just before exercise, with or without a 50% reduction in basal rate insulin, compared to a 50% basal rate insulin reduction alone prevents the occurrence of hypoglycemia (i.e., blood glucose <70 mg/dL) measured by blood glucose meter during and after moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise by adult subjects with T1D in an outpatient setting. 
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Bi-Hormonal Artificial Pancreas Closed-Loop Systems
We are evaluating our ready-to-use glucagon for use in a bi-hormonal artificial pancreas closed-loop system. In mid-2019, OHSU completed a Phase 1 proof-of-concept randomized three-way crossover clinical trial to evaluate the utility of such a system. OHSU presented topline results at the ADA 79th Scientific Sessions in June 2019 and submitted results to a peer-reviewed journal. Based on the study results, we plan to support advancement of OHSU and other artificial pancreas programs with ready-to-use glucagon. In December 2013, we filed an IND application for the use of ready-to-use glucagon in a bi-hormonal artificial pancreas closed-loop system. We are the sponsor of this IND, which is active as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Market
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion from a pump ("CSII") has been shown to improve glycemic control for people with diabetes. However, data from clinical trials indicate that even when used in closed-loop, insulin analogs, pumps and CGMs have generally modest effects in reducing hypoglycemic events because they are capable of only delivering or stopping delivery of insulin. As such, CSII users are still forced to ingest carbohydrate containing foods or over-the-counter glucose products or utilize emergency glucagon products to counteract hypoglycemia.
We believe the quality of life for patients could be significantly improved by offering a bi-hormonal artificial pancreas that delivers both insulin and glucagon. While significant work has been done developing extensive algorithms and control systems needed for the bi-hormonal pump, a key limitation has been the lack of a glucagon formulation that does not require reconstitution and is stable for at least three days in a pump chamber. We believe the utilization of our ready-to-use glucagon in a bi-hormonal system has the potential to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia, improve patient quality of life, and drive higher rates of adoption of CSII systems.
All patients utilizing an intensive insulin regimen are candidates for a bi-hormonal pump system. In the United States, this includes all 1.5 million people with T1D as well as approximately 1.0 million people with T2D. Of this population, approximately one-third of patients with T1D and a very small percentage of those with T2D are currently utilizing CSII therapy.
Xeris Offering—Liquid-Stable Ready-To-Use Glucagon for a Bi-Hormonal Artificial Pancreas
A liquid-stable glucagon formulation is a critical component to facilitate a bi-hormonal artificial pancreas. Our ready-to-use glucagon has demonstrated stability at body temperature in a patch pump chamber. Collaborators in our bi-hormonal artificial pancreas program include endocrinologists at OHSU. In addition, numerous researchers have expressed interest in using our ready-to-use glucagon in research studies with novel bi-hormonal pump systems.
17

To support development of our ready-to-use glucagon for this application, we have been awarded approximately $1.9 million in funding from organizations such as the NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the JDRF.
Clinical Experience
We have successfully completed a number of preclinical studies in multiple species, a Phase 2a dose-ranging glucagon PK/PD study and a Phase 1 proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial
NCT 03424044: A Randomized, Three-Way, Cross-Over Outpatient Study to Assess the Efficacy of a Dual-Hormone Closed-Loop System with XeriSol Glucagon vs Closed-Loop System with Insulin Only vs a Predictive Low Glucose Suspend System
This was a single center, randomized, three-way, crossover investigator-initiated trial conducted by OHSU using our ready-to-use glucagon in a vial. Subjects underwent the 76-hour study with 9 hours inpatient and 67 hours outpatient using the closed-loop artificial pancreas system. The trial was completed in mid-2019 and was designed to compare glucose control resulting from the use of a bi- and single-hormone closed-loop system as compared to a predictive low glucose suspend system ("PLGS"), using the percent of time with sensed glucose below 70 mg/dl as the primary endpoint. The bi-hormonal closed-loop system is designed to reduce the time spent in the hypoglycemic range and increase the time spent in the target range, even during and after exercise, as compared to an insulin only closed-loop system and a predictive low glucose suspend system. OHSU reported study results at the ADA 79th Scientific Sessions in June 2019. They reported that dual-hormone improved overall hypoglycemia as compared to single-hormone and PLGS. Single-hormone and dual-hormone both significantly improved time in range compared to PLGS. Time in range was similar between single and dual hormone, but the dual hormone achieved this with lower hypoglycemia. Dual-hormone reduced rescue carbohydrate treatments compared to single-hormone and PLGS.
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Congenital Hyperinsulinism
We have decided not to proceed with a planned Phase 3 CHI study based on the challenging regulatory pathway coupled with the limited market opportunity. Instead, we will consider requests to make our liquid-stable glucagon available for approved Expanded Access requests at no cost to eligible patients. (Expanded Access is a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or serious disease to gain access to an investigational drug for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available.)
Ready-to-Use Glucagon for Hypoglycemia-Associated Autonomic Failure
We concluded our Hypoglycemia-Associated Autonomic Failure ("HAAF") program based on results from our Phase 2 clinical trial in adult T1D subjects, as no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms were observed based on percent change in plasma epinephrine concentration from baseline. HAAF is a condition in which chronic hypoglycemia impairs the body’s natural response to restore blood sugar levels and can lead to an individual becoming unaware of the onset of a severe hypoglycemic event and result in cardiovascular disease, seizure, coma, and, if left untreated, death. In previous publications, the strict avoidance of hypoglycemia in subjects with HAAF has been shown to improve counterregulatory epinephrine and autonomic symptom responses and consequently reestablish the awareness of hypoglycemia. We evaluated whether two dose levels of continuous subcutaneous glucagon infusion ("CSGI"), administered over 28 days, could similarly restore the epinephrine response to hypoglycemia in subjects with HAAF. This was a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel trial in adult T1D subjects. In this trial, 49 subjects with documented HAAF were randomized to receive 4 weeks of treatment with high rate CSGI (n=15), low rate CSGI (n=18), or placebo (n=16). Epinephrine was quantified following a stepwise hypoglycemia induction. CSGI was not sufficient to restore defective glucose counter-regulation (epinephrine response) or hypoglycemia symptom awareness. While there were positive epinephrine and improved hypoglycemia awareness responses observed in some subjects, the equivocal efficacy results observed may be explained by the incomplete elimination of time spent with hypoglycemia. The administration of both low and high rate CSGI was generally well tolerated, and no significant adverse events related to CSGI were reported. 
Non-Glucagon Programs
XeriSol Pramlintide-Insulin Co-formulation 
Leveraging our XeriSol platform, we are developing a ready-to-use fixed dose combination of insulin and pramlintide to be delivered via a vial and syringe. Pramlintide is an injectable amylin analog for both Type 1 and 2 diabetes. In normal physiology, amylin is a hormone that is co-secreted into the bloodstream at a fixed ratio with insulin by the beta cells of the pancreas. The U.S. approval and launch of pramlintide (Symlin®) brought significant interest because of its ability, when used in combination with mealtime insulin, to flatten post-prandial blood glucose levels, reduce glucose excursions, and cause weight loss. Short-term and long-term clinical trials have found that adding pre-prandial pramlintide injections to insulin therapy reduced post-prandial glucose excursions and improved overall glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c levels) in patients with T1D. Clinically, pramlintide accomplishes this by reducing food intake, delaying 
18

gastric emptying, and reducing endogenous glucose production in the liver by suppressing glucagon secretion. The use of pramlintide also allows for about 30% less insulin utilization due to differential efficacy.

Pramlintide is indicated in people with diabetes for use at all major meals where patients already administer bolus insulin. The addition of a pramlintide regimen adds three or more separate injections daily which could be a challenging proposition in this patient population. We believe current use of pramlintide is quite limited because the injection burden issues outweigh the perceived benefits. To date, co-formulation/mixtures of pramlintide and insulin have experienced technical difficulties due to the physico-chemical incompatibility of a native mixture of each of these components. We believe our ready-to-use, room-temperature stable XeriSol co-formulation of pramlintide and regular insulin as well as pramlintide and lispro insulin can benefit patients by reducing the number of required injections. We address the co-formulation problem by utilizing our XeriSol technology to develop stable pramlintide and regular insulin formulations as well as stable pramlintide and lispro insulin formulations. XeriSol forms a stable co-formulation of pramlintide and insulins (regular or lispro) without the need for novel excipients. XeriSol pramlintide-insulins can be presented as a variable-fixed-ratio combination of either six or nine µg pramlintide per unit of insulin. These ratios have been shown to have beneficial clinical efficacy profiles in previous studies.

XeriSol pramlintide-insulin has several potentially valuable stability properties from a patient use perspective: potential two-year stability when refrigerated and up to 90 days at room temperature. This stability profile is comparable to current insulin products and would not introduce new handling challenges for existing insulin patients.
In preclinical studies, we characterized the PK and PD of pramlintide and various insulin formulations in normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats (mimicking T1D) given as separate injections or as a XeriSol pramlintide-insulin combined dose. Consistent with pramlintide’s known pharmacological action, there was no glucose lowering with pramlintide alone. Profiles for pramlintide were similar to either saline or XeriSol vehicle administered by subcutaneous injection in rats. XeriSol pramlintide-insulin demonstrated a longer duration of glucose lowering compared to separate injections of pramlintide (Symlin) and insulin (Humulin®). Figures 1 and 2 below show a comparison of efficacy based on changes in glucose levels after injection of XeriSol pramlintide-insulin and pramlintide-lispro in comparison with separate injections of Symlin and Humulin or Symlin and Humalog® in a rodent model. In a preclinical study, XeriSol pram-insulin maintained glucose control for approximately four hours as compared to separate injections of commercially available product combinations (mimicking human subcutaneous administration) that begin to lose glucose control after approximately two hours. 
We initiated a study of our novel XeriSol pramlintide-insulin co-formulation in a clinical trial in T1D in the third quarter of 2019. This study compares XeriSol pramlintide-insulin versus separate injections of Symlin and Humulin in diabetic subjects. According to recent guidance from the FDA, the insulin component of our XeriSol pramlintide-insulin co-formulation is subject to the FDA’s “deemed to be a license” provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which may necessitate that we submit a biologics license application for any future marketing authorization by the FDA.

Ready-to-Use Diazepam
Leveraging our XeriSol formulation technology, we are developing a ready-to-use diazepam formulation for which we were granted an orphan designation by the FDA for the treatment of ARS and Dravet syndrome in patients with epilepsy. Approximately 160,000 people in the United States experience ARS. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of intractable epilepsy that begins in infancy with an estimated incidence rate of 1:16,000 to 1:21,000 in the United States.
Immediate treatment of epileptic seizures is critical to avoid increased risks of morbidity and mortality, including permanent neuronal damage, behavioral abnormalities and an increased probability in the need for life-long care.
Injectable and rectal gel formulations of diazepam are the current standard of care for the emergency treatment of epileptic seizures. In 2018, these diazepam formulations generated total U.S. sales of approximately $86 million, of which Diastat Rectal Gel and its generic formulations comprised $74 million. Diastat® requires a multi-step procedure which makes it more difficult to administer while a patient is experiencing seizures. Additionally, the use of rectal gel in both middle school children and young adults with ARS is reduced because of social stigma. These characteristics are limitations that may diminish the specific demand for rectal diazepam products. Due to this limitation, we believe the market for diazepam in ARS is underpenetrated. We believe that a ready-to-use diazepam rescue pen would improve patient quality of life and drive adoption of diazepam to treat ARS.
Our ready-to-use diazepam formulation has demonstrated rapid onset and high bioavailability in preclinical models. We received orphan drug designation for our product candidate from the FDA and were awarded grants totaling $2.3 million from the Epilepsy Foundation and the NIH for this program. An IND application for our ready-to-use diazepam rescue pen for ARS went into effect on November 28, 2018. This IND authorized us to initiate a study (XSDZ-101) evaluating the PK and PD of our ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid diazepam formulation in normal volunteers. Below is a description of this study. Based on these results, we initiated a second Phase 1 open-label, single-arm, weight-based dosing study with IM administration of diazepam in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2019. We expect topline results in the first half of 2020. 
XSDZ-101: A Randomized Crossover Study of the Comparative Bioavailability, Pharmacokinetics, and Tolerability of Diazepam After Subcutaneous, Intramuscular, and Rectal Administration in Healthy Subjects 
In May 2019, we announced positive results from our Phase 1 study of our novel formulation of diazepam. The open-label, three-treatment, three-way crossover, randomized controlled study was conducted among 24 healthy volunteers to assess the bioavailability and PK of our novel formulation of diazepam after IM and SC administration compared to an administration of commercial diazepam rectal gel (Diastat). Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of our diazepam after SC and IM administration. Our IM and SC administration of 10 mg diazepam yielded higher exposure as compared to an equivalent dose of diazepam rectal gel as assessed by AUC "(zero to infinity)".  In individual comparisons, our administration resembled Diastat for both Cmax and Tmax.  Additionally, both arms were safe and well-tolerated as a single dose.  The study found no safety trends in any treatment group. Based on these results, we initiated another Phase 1 open-label, single-arm, weight-based dosing study with IM administration of diazepam in normal volunteers in the second half of 2019. We expect topline results from this trial in the first half of 2020.

Manufacturing and Supply
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture, assembly, testing, packaging, storage and distribution of our products. In our experience, third party contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") are generally cost-efficient, high quality and reliable, and we currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing or distribution infrastructure. Our technical team has extensive pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, analytical, quality and distribution experience and is qualified and capable of managing supply chain operations across multiple CMOs. Our Quality System, Standard Operating Procedures and CMO interfaces are designed to promote cGMP compliance and effective regulatory communications. We selected our CMOs for specific competencies, and they have met our development, manufacturing, quality and regulatory requirements and were all involved in manufacturing our clinical supplies and commercial registration batches.
Glucagon is the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") used in Gvoke and our ready-to-use glucagon product candidates. Bachem Americas, Inc., ("Bachem") is our primary commercial source for API. Bachem holds a U.S. drug master file for glucagon produced at its facility in Switzerland, and its manufacturing process is fully validated. We have entered into a non-exclusive supply agreement with Bachem. While we believe that Bachem has sufficient capacity to satisfy our long-term requirements for Gvoke and other pipeline products utilizing ready-to-use glucagon, we are evaluating alternate sourcing options. 
Manufacturing drug product for Gvoke requires an aseptic fill/finish facility capable of handling solvents and a cyclic olefinic polymer syringe. Pyramid Laboratories, Inc. ("Pyramid") has been actively involved in the development of Gvoke and our ready-to-use glucagon product candidates. Its facility in California is our primary source for drug product. We have entered into a non-exclusive supply agreement with Pyramid. While we believe that Pyramid has sufficient capacity to satisfy our demand requirements for at least three to five years, we are evaluating alternate sourcing options.
The auto-injector used to deliver drug product in Gvoke HypoPen is a proprietary multi-product device platform developed by SHL Medical AG, SHL Pharma LLC, and SHL Pharma (collectively "SHL"). SHL produces device sub-assemblies in company-owned facilities in Taiwan and performs final drug product/device assembly operations at its facility in Florida. We have entered into a non-exclusive supply agreement with SHL. We intend to source the device from a single supplier over the life of the product.
We believe that a number of CMOs can provide suitable secondary packaging services for Gvoke, and we have entered into commercial supply agreements with one vendor. A number of third-party logistic providers can provide commercial order processing and finished goods distribution services to U.S. wholesale customers, and we entered into a commercial distribution agreement with one such vendor in 2019.
Competition
Our industry is characterized by intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our products and product candidates include likelihood of successful dose delivery, ease of administration, therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and cost. While we believe that our product and product candidate platform, development expertise and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products.
Two emergency glucagon kits are currently available to treat severe hypoglycemia: Eli Lilly’s GEK and Novo Nordisk’s GlucaGen HypoKit. Each kit is sold as a vial of lyophilized, glucagon powder with an exposed syringe/needle that contains a liquid diluent. The glucagon powder must be combined with the liquid diluent at the time of use and drawn into a syringe in accordance with a complex multi-step reconstitution and dose calibration procedure. Additionally, once reconstituted, the glucagon must be used immediately because once the lyophilized glucagon is combined with water, the solution becomes unstable and can fibrillate, rendering it potentially inactive. We believe that the drawbacks of traditional kits and the lack of conversations regarding glucagon limit their adoption. In addition, Eli Lilly has developed an intranasal glucagon dry powder, BAQSIMI, that was approved by the FDA in July 2019 and launched in August 2019, and Fresenius Kabi introduced an emergency glucagon kit in February 2020. The latter is functionally indistinguishable from the Lilly GEK and Novo GlucaGen HypoKit.
In our market research, respondents ranked the importance of successful full-dose delivery and ability to tell if the full dose was administered significantly higher than the attribute "needleless". Caregivers and people with diabetes associated Gvoke HypoPen with efficacious and successful dose delivery, as well as ease of ability to tell if the full dose was administered. Similarly, healthcare professionals indicated that one of the most appealing attributes of Gvoke is the greater likelihood of successful dose delivery.

Zealand Pharma is developing dasiglucagon, a stable analog of human glucagon, in an auto-injector for subcutaneous administration. Based on its public filings, Zealand has stated it intends to file a New Drug Application ("NDA") in early 2020. Zealand’s dasiglucagon completed a Phase 3 clinical development program that studied the investigational product candidate in adults and children with T1D. 
While there are currently no FDA-approved products indicated for treatment of PBH, we are aware of a number of product candidates in development. Eiger Biopharmaceuticals is developing its product candidate avexitide (exendin 9-39), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor antagonist, to be administered subcutaneously once or twice daily. Eiger completed a Phase 2 clinical study with avexitide and an end-of-Phase 2 FDA meeting, and received guidance from the FDA on a Phase 3 clinical requirements. Additionally, a clinical investigator has initiated a proof-of-concept study (NCT03984370) with Zealand Pharma’s dasiglucagon in patients with PBH. 
Currently, the first-line emergency treatment of epileptic seizures in the outpatient setting is the administration of diazepam rectal gel marketed as Diastat by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. UCB’s midazolam nasal spray Nayzilam, indicated for seizure clusters and ARS, launched in December 2019, and Neurelis, Inc. received approval in January 2020 for their nasal diazepam product, VALTOCO™ (previously known as NRL-1), for the treatment of seizure clusters and ARS. VALTOCO became commercially available in March 2020. Aquestive’s NDA for buccal soluble diazepam Libervant™ (previously known as AQST-203), also for the treatment of seizure clusters and ARS, is under review by the FDA with the PDUFA date of September 27, 2020. Engage Therapeutics is developing an inhaled alprazolam (known as STAP-001) for ARS, with the agent currently in Phase 2b development.
Intellectual Property
Proprietary Protection
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and product candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We have been building and continue to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our product candidates and technology. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us or our partners in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
Patent Rights
As of December 31, 2019, we owned 114 issued patents globally, of which 14 are issued U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2019, three of our U.S. issued patents have pending continuations or divisionals in process which may provide additional intellectual property protection if issued as U.S. patents. Our issued patents expire between December 22, 2023 and April 22, 2036, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. The subset of our patent estate directed specifically to our ready-to-use glucagon consists of one U.S. composition of matter patent that is scheduled to expire in year 2036, two pending U.S. patent applications and 18 international patent applications. Patents that issue based on these applications would also expire in year 2036.
Trade Secret and Other Protection
In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we own all inventions conceived and/or reduced to practice by the individual in the course of their employment with us or rendering services to us.
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We file trademark applications and pursue registrations in the United States and abroad when appropriate. We own a U.S. registered trademark for the mark Xeris Pharmaceuticals. We also own pending trademark applications for XERISOL, XERIJECT, GVOKE, GVOKE HYPOPEN and HYPOPEN in the United States and XERISOL and XERIJECT in the EU for use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development and products, as well as trade names that could be used with our potential products. The USPTO has allowed 
22

the following trademark applications which are awaiting the acceptance by the USPTO of Statements of Use: XERISOL, XERIJECT, GVOKE, GVOKE HYPOPEN, HYPOPEN and GLUCAPEN.
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders.
Grant Agreements
Through December 31, 2019, we have received $1.9 million in grant proceeds for the development of a stable liquid glucagon for use in an artificial pancreas. Under the terms of one of the grant agreements, we will be required to pay up to four times the $0.9 million award received upon commercialization of glucagon for use in the artificial pancreas. If we undergo a change in control, then we will be required to pay a mid-single digit percentage of the gross proceeds, capped at four times the award amount less any amounts already paid. Additionally, if sales of glucagon for use in the artificial pancreas exceed $750 million in the first five years after the first commercial sale, then we would be required to make an additional payment equal to the original award amount.
Through December 31, 2019, we received $2.0 million in grant proceeds to help fund our EIH program. Under terms of one of the the agreements, we will be required to pay up to two times the $0.9 million award amount upon the commercialization of an EIH product. These amounts are a low double-digit percentage of annual gross sales of an EIH product, capped at $0.5 million annually. If we undergo a change in control, then we will pay a mid-single digit percentage of the consideration capped at two times the award amount less any amounts already paid. Additionally, if sales exceed $1 billion, we will be required to pay an additional amount equal to two times the award amount.
Through December 31, 2019, we received $1.0 million in grant proceeds to help fund our T1D chronic glucagon programs. Under terms of this agreement, we will be required to pay up to two times the award amount upon the commercialization of any chronic glucagon program. These amounts are a low double-digit percentage of annual gross sales of all T1D chronic glucagon programs, capped at $0.5 million annually. If we undergo a change in control, then we will pay a mid-single digit percentage of the consideration capped at two times the award amount less any amounts already paid. Additionally, for each chronic glucagon program where sales exceed $500 million, we will be required to pay an additional amount equal to two times the award amount.
We have also received awards from the NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases, which awards are not subject to any repayment obligations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations and Commitments” for additional details.
Loan and Security Agreement
In February 2018, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement that provided a senior secured loan facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million. The first tranche was $20.0 million and was drawn down in February 2018. The second tranche was $15.0 million and was drawn down in September 2018. In September 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement ("Amended Loan Agreement") which amended and restated the Loan and Security Agreement in its entirety and provides up to $85.0 million in term loans in three tranches. The initial tranche of $60.0 million was drawn down in September 2019 and remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The second tranche of $15.0 million and the third tranche of $10.0 million will become available upon achievement of certain revenue targets prior to March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The $35.0 million drawn down under the Loan and Security Agreement and the related final payment fee of $2.3 million were repaid in conjunction with the execution of the Amended Loan Agreement. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loan Agreement” for additional details.
Government Regulation
United States Drug and Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the FDCA and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA") and their implementing regulations. Drugs, biologics, medical devices and combination products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
23

Our products and certain of our product candidates are subject to regulation as combination products, which means that they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different Centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of Gvoke and some of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, or biological component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval. Accordingly, we plan to continue to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA or Biologics License Applications ("BLA") pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the device, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
< | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") regulations; 
< | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
< | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
< | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices ("GCPs"), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its proposed indication;
< | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
< | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements ("cGMP"); 
< | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; 
< | payment of associated user fees; 
< | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
< | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale; and 
< | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 

Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance and may be imposed on all drug or biological products within a certain class of drugs or biologics. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
24

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

< | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
< | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
< | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Companies that conduct certain clinical trials also are required to register them and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov in the United States, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review Process
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biologic, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, requesting approval to market the product. An NDA for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. A BLA is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety, purity, and potency. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs or BLAs are subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2020 is $2,942,965 for an NDA or BLA requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2020 is $325,424 for each product presentation. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. The decision to accept the NDA or BLA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of the NDA or ten months from the filing date of an NDA for a new molecular entity or original BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and may go through multiple review cycles.
After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological 
25

products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA or BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA or BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical trials to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and 
26

information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug ("RLD").
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is the same as the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity ("NCE") is a drug that contains no active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance, that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states that the proposed drug will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitive generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
Marketing Exclusivity for Biological Products 
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCI Act"). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. 
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. ‘‘First licensure’’ typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. 
27

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant relies on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

< | the required patent information has not been filed; 
< | the listed patent has expired; 
< | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
< | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not provide a Paragraph IV certification against the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:

< | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
< | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
< | a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
< | any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 

Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
28

A combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA or 505(b)(2) application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System ("QS") regulations applicable to medical devices.
Drug-device combination products present unique challenges for competitors seeking approval of an ANDA for generic versions of combination products. Generally, FDA reviews both the drug and device constituents of a proposed generic product to determine whether it is the same as the innovator product, including whether the basic design and operating principles of the device component are the same and whether minor differences require significant differences in labeling for safe and effective use. If FDA determines that the device component of the proposed generic product is not the same in terms of performance and critical design, or that the labeling is not the same, it generally will not approve the ANDA. Likewise, if FDA determines that certain clinical studies, such as clinical usability or human factors studies, are necessary to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the device component, FDA generally will not accept or approve an ANDA for a combination product and will instead require the submission of a full NDA or 505(b)(2) application.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse events with the product, providing the applicable regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, and product sampling and distribution requirements in accordance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA"), a part of the FDCA, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA"). The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains its regulatory status (as a drug or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
Prescription drug and biologic advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug and biologic promotion and advertising, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. In addition, a pharmaceutical company must comply with restrictions on promoting drugs and biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s or biologic's approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs or biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers are prohibited from marketing or promoting such off-label uses.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that combination products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs applicable to drugs, biologics and devices, including certain QS requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug and biologics manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA or Biologics License Application ("BLA") holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new 
29

legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and impact approved products already on the market.
Other Regulatory Matters
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Alternatively, orphan drug designation may be available if the disease or the condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product with the same drug for the same condition under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("PSP") within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The requirements for pediatric data generally do not apply to drugs or biologics for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent five-year and three-year and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly 
30

respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Regulations and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of pharmaceutical development, preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities for clinical trials authorization and to the EMA for an MAA and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.
European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products ("COMP") grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan drug designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. Although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, we are subject to broadly applicable healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments, which could significantly impact our business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration ("OSHA"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), and state and local governments. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
31


< | Anti-Kickback Statute ("AKS"). The federal AKS makes it illegal for any person or entity (including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or intended to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, prescription or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the AKS without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. This law applies to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs.
< | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, such as the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to a federal government healthcare program, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Companies that submit claims directly to payors may also be liable under the FCA for the direct submission of such claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Our marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and any future product candidates are subject to scrutiny under this law;

HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursing federal civil actions;

Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission.

Additionally, we may be subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our drug candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to non-U.S. equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other non-U.S. laws.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business.
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
33

We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Since its enactment, some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial, Congressional, and Executive challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is referred to as the “individual mandate”, the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. However, the current presidential administration has indicated that enacting changes to the ACA is a legislative priority and has discussed repealing and replacing or amending the ACA. Under the Trump Administration, there are ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or part of the ACA or take executive action that affects its implementation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”), for example, includes a provision that repealed the individual mandate effective January 1, 2019.
Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The Trump administration has concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. The Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act of 2017 as well as the follow-on Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act of 2018 were introduced to appropriate funds to stabilize CSR payments; however, the future of this effort is unclear.
On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices (these three provisions have been repealed, as discussed below). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D from 50% to 70%, effective January 1, 2019, and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865). This law repeals the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this 
34

risk adjustment. Additionally, CMS published a final rule that will give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
Since 2016, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing or delaying penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate no longer had any monetary impact on those who did not have qualifying insurance as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held the individual mandate is unconstitutional but remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business.
In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration has included drug price control measures in past budget proposals that may be enacted in future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Moreover, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act or FDA’s expanded access program authorities, but the manufacturer must develop and make publicly available its policy on expanded access availability and respond to patient requests according to that policy.

We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products or product candidates, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular pharmaceutical drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the pharmaceutical drug product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical drug products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive clinical trials in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national drug rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for state Medicaid coverage of the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price ("AMP") to 23.1% of AMP, adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products. In addition, the ACA also modified the statutory definition of AMP which created a new calculation methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers are determined for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and thereby potentially impacting manufacturers' rebate liability. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA") established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare 
36

beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the Medicaid unit rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on a drug designated by the Secretary under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for a rare disease or condition. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
However, on December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a recent Medicare reimbursement formula change instituted by CMS when 340B hospitals purchase drugs under the 340B program for use in the hospital outpatient setting. For the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years, CMS altered the reimbursement formula from Average Sale Price ("ASP") plus 6% to ASP minus 22.5% on specified covered outpatient drugs ("SCODs"). The court ruled this change was not an “adjustment” which was within the Secretary’s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation, and such a dramatic change was beyond the scope of the Secretary’s authority. On May 6, 2019, the district court reiterated that the rate reduction exceeded the Secretary’s authority and declared that the rate reduction for 2019 also exceeded the Secretary’s authority and remanded the issue to HHS to devise an appropriate remedy. On July 10, 2019, the district court entered its final judgment and CMS has filed an appeal. It is unclear how the invalidation of the formula could affect pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals who prescribe their products, but litigation is still pending on the issue. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drugs, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drugs after approval. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
These laws and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our products or product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product is prescribed or used.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more of our products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, proposed federal, and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. Some of these measures include price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or product candidates, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. For example, on December 18, 2019, President Trump, HHS and the FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that, if finalized, would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. The FDA also issued a Draft Guidance document outlining a potential pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code, or NDC, for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The regulatory and market implications of the notice of proposed rulemaking and Draft Guidance are unknown at this time, but legislation, regulations or policies allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted and implemented, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and commercialize and could adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.

Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
