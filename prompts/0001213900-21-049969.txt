Overview
 
Corporate History and Structure
 
Liaoning Shuiyun Qinghe Rice Industry Co., Ltd. (f/k/a Evergreen International Corp.) (“Shuiyun Qinghe”, “we”, “our” or “the Company”) started as a wood products company that had been in business since 1980. Our business fluctuated over the years. We were almost wholly dependent on sales to The Home Depot, Inc. On September 2, 2003, we terminated our business relationship with Home Depot due to increased difficulties in transacting business with such company on a profitable basis. These difficulties included Home Depot’s prohibition against price increases, despite increases in our costs of production, a diminution in the Home Depot territories to which we were allowed to sell our products, and Home Depot’s demands regarding returns of ordered products that we were unwilling to accede to for economic reasons.
 
On June 22, 2018, the Company (f/k/a Arbor EnTech Corporation) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Tan Ying Lok (the “Purchaser”) and certain selling stockholders including Airmont Trust and Brad Houtkin, the Company’s two controlling stockholders (collectively, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to acquire 7,258,750 shares of common stock representing approximately 98.75% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock (the “Shares”) for $325,000. The acquisition consummated on July 27, 2018, resulting in a change of control of the Company. The securities were sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder.
 
In connection with the acquisition, Mr. Brad Houtkin resigned from his positions as President, CEO, Treasurer and Director of the Company, Mr. Michael Houtkin resigned from his positions as the Secretary and Director of the Company, and Ms. Sherry Houtkin resigned as the Director of the Company. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. Effective August 6, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Jianguo Wei to serve as the sole Director, CEO, President and Treasurer of the Company, and Ge Gao as the Corporate Secretary of the Company.
 
Mr. Jianguo Wei and Tan Ying Lok are also parties to that certain Call Option Agreement, dated June 22, 2018, pursuant to which Mr. Lok granted Mr. Wei the option to purchase all shares of common stock of the Company held by Mr. Lok at a purchase price of RMB 200,000. The option to purchase expires June 21, 2023. The foregoing description of the Call Option Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Call Option Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On July 6, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) declared a cash dividend in an aggregate amount of $181,996, or an average of $0.024760 per share, payable to stockholders of record on July 16, 2018, and (ii) approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to Evergreen International Corp, which amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 13, 2018 and became effective on July 20, 2018.
 
On October 20, 2020, Jianguo Wei, our former Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director, entered into an Acquisition Agreement with Shanghai Yuyue Enterprise Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (“SYEM”) pursuant to which Mr. Wei agreed to sell all 7,258,750 shares held by Tan Ying Lok, constituting approximately 98.75% of the Company, to SYEM for aggregate cash consideration of $200,000. Mr. Wei was authorized to enter into the Acquisition Agreement on behalf of Mr. Lok pursuant to an Authorization Letter dated October 20, 2020. The acquisition consummated on October 20, 2020, and the parties are in the process of transferring the securities to SYEM which is expected to be completed in October 2021. The securities were sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder. The foregoing description of the Acquisition Agreement and Authorization Letter are qualified in their entirety by reference to the such agreement and letter, which are filed as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 to this Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference.

In connection with the sale of securities to SYEM, Mr. Jianguo Wei resigned from all his positions with the Company, and Mr. He Baobing and Mr. Cui Weinming were appointed as the Company’s Directors as well as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, effective October 20, 2020.
 
In February, 2021, the Company changed its corporate name to Liaoning Shuiyun Qinghe Rice Industry Co., Ltd. and ticker symbol of the Common Stock to SYQH.
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. Our principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. We are in active discussions with an operating company for a potential business combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate such an acquisition or that following such acquisition we will be eligible to trade on a national securities exchange, or be quoted on the Over-the-Counter.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

● | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other relevant factors.
--+------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
