ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Sleep Number Corporation, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was incorporated in 1987 and became publicly traded in 1998. We are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq Global Select Market) under the symbol SNBR. When used herein, the terms “Sleep Number,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sleep Number Corporation, including our consolidated subsidiaries.
At Sleep Number, our purpose is to improve the health and wellbeing of society through higher quality sleep. We are committed to leveraging the power of sleep, and sleep science, to improve lives and create a healthier, kinder, more inclusive world. And because of our team’s dedication to our mission, disciplined execution of our vertically integrated business model and differentiated consumer innovation strategy, Sleep Number is at the forefront of delivering this life-changing benefit. With our revolutionary Sleep Number 360®  smart beds and SleepIQ®  technology, we have improved 13 million lives.
Financial Highlights
In 2020, we increased net sales by 9% to $1.9 billion, earnings per diluted share (EPS) by 81% to $4.90 and cash from operations by 48% to $280 million. Our 2020 fiscal year included an extra week which we estimate benefited net sales by $41 million and EPS by $0.30. These results reflect the acceleration of three structural consumer shifts we anticipated at the inception of our consumer innovation strategy in 2012:
•First, consumers are prioritizing wellbeing – their own and that of their families, and they understand the strong link between sleep and overall health and wellness;
•Second, consumers are adopting digital products and services at a much faster and higher rate, and they are increasingly relying on digital health solutions; and
•Third, consumers have a heightened preference for brands that are characterized by authentic purpose and human empathy. 
Each of these shifts is enduring, fueling permanent changes in consumer purchasing behavior and propelling our profitable growth.
With our strategic, enterprise-wide investments in innovation, technology, logistics, marketing and customer service, we have created a competitively advantaged strategy and a highly relevant brand – which together, are delivering superior shareholder value.
Proprietary Sleep Innovations
Sleep Number 360 smart beds effortlessly deliver proven quality sleep by allowing each sleeper to set their ideal firmness, support and pressure-relieving comfort – their Sleep Number® setting. SleepIQ technology optimizes the smart benefits of the bed, continually improving a sleeper’s restful time asleep – their SleepIQ® score – to deliver a life-changing difference to their overall health and wellness.
Every night, through our proprietary SleepIQ technology, we collect more than 19 billion data points from our real-world sleepers, generating comprehensive and longitudinal data at a scale never seen before in sleep science. To date, we have leveraged and learned from nine billion hours of sleep data gathered from more than one billion sleep sessions. We are using our proprietary longitudinal data and artificial intelligence capabilities to advance smart bed hardware and bio-signal features, enabling us to provide connected sleep solutions that deliver ongoing impact for consumers’ wellbeing. We are creating and introducing solutions and technology that will meaningfully impact sleep for a healthier society. In the future, our award-winning 360® smart beds could provide a form of preventative and proactive health care that one day may detect or prevent serious health conditions like sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome and heart disease.
Based on analysis of more than 25 million sleep sessions, Sleep Number research shows that sleepers who routinely use their 360 smart bed features and SleepIQ technology can improve quality sleep by over 15 minutes each night, nearly 100 hours each year. Third-party studies have shown that even 15 more minutes of quality sleep per night increase a body’s ability to stave off weight gain or a cold, and can increase productivity. 
In 2020, we unveiled the next generation of 360 smart beds with technology to advance our health and wellness platform and made several new sleep innovations available through our SleepIQ technology platform, including:
•Nighttime Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – a measure of the variation of time between each heartbeat, which can be an indication of an individual’s overall health. A high HRV, for example, may indicate greater cardiovascular fitness and physical recovery ability. With a consistent nighttime HRV snapshot – free from the influence of daytime external factors – 360 smart bed sleepers may better understand their resilience, activity level and energy each day;
•Sleep Circadian Insights – automatically tracks sleep and wake times for each sleeper in the SleepIQ® platform application. Using artificial intelligence, SleepIQ technology learns a sleeper’s patterns and provides guidance to optimize sleep and wake times, such as what time of day they are most alert or their optimal times to work out and go to bed. Analysis shows that sleepers who engage with the new feature experience a 35-minute improvement to sleep timing (i.e., more consistent bedtime and wake time) and a 2-point improvement to their SleepIQ score; and
•Monthly Sleep Wellness Reports – provides an overview of personalized insights, highlighting sleep health, circadian stability and respiratory and cardiovascular health via HRV. The report helps sleepers effortlessly understand their sleep and see how their sleep health has changed over time. Initial research indicated that 8 out of 10 users found the Sleep Wellness Reports to be valuable, and 40 percent of those users changed sleep-related behaviors based upon information provided in the reports, such as going to bed earlier or changing their pre-bedtime routine. Sleep Number 360 smart bed sleepers can share their Sleep Wellness Reports with their healthcare providers, giving physicians unique access to individualized data that could help provide a more holistic picture of patient health.
In 2020, we also announced our forthcoming Sleep Number Climate360™ smart bed, the first-ever bed that uses advanced temperature technology to create a personalized, responsive microclimate with automatic firmness adjustability. Unveiled at CES 2020, both the Climate360 and new 360 smart beds won prestigious awards, including the CES 2020 “Best of Innovation” award.
Sleep Number also offers a full line of exclusive FlexFit™ smart adjustable bases that allow customers to raise the head or foot of the bed. These industry leading FlexFit bases seamlessly integrate with SleepIQ technology to deliver features like our Partner Snore™ technology, which allows a sleeping partner to temporarily relieve mild snoring by raising their companion’s head at the touch of a button.
The SleepIQ Kids® k2 bed extends Sleep Number’s DualAir™ adjustability and SleepIQ technology to the children’s mattress market. The k2 bed adjusts with children as they grow, giving them the best possible sleep.
Our exclusive Sleep Number® bedding collection features a full line of sleep products designed to improve sleep comfort and quality, including a broad assortment of pillow sizes and shapes that fit each individual’s preferred sleeping position.
We also offer a variety of temperature-balancing products including the DualTemp™ layer. This proprietary sleep innovation features active air technology that allows each sleeper to select their ideal temperature at the simple touch of a button and can be used with any mattress brand or adjustable base.
Research and Sleep Science
Research and sleep science are at the core of all Sleep Number innovations. With global R&D operations in the USA, Europe and Asia, we conduct extensive research to understand consumers’ needs and inspire the design and delivery of our award-winning sleep innovations, our proprietary SleepIQ technology platform and our customer experience.
Our Minneapolis, MN-based R&D team leads the innovation of our smart mattress, adjustable base design, and bedding solutions and is comprised of experts in mechanical engineering, comfort, adjustability, temperature, anthropometrics and test systems. Our Sleep Number Labs team in San Jose, CA supports the evolution of SleepIQ technology with leading experts in sleep research, data science, analytics and full-stack Internet of Things platform development.
We have accelerated our investments in R&D to enhance our competitive advantage. We continue to enhance our expertise and capabilities specific to the healthcare industry, forming an internal SleepIQ health team, advancing Sleep Number’s leadership in connected sleep health and further underscoring the commitment to innovation in health and wellness. As a result of our R&D and strategic efforts, we have continued to grow our patent portfolio, with a particular focus on smart features that improve sleep quality, and thermal solutions to solve temperature disruptions to sleep. Our world-wide patent portfolio now contains more than 350 patents, which enhances our protection of our exclusive and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses were $41 million in 2020, $35 million in 2019 and $29 million in 2018.
Aligned with our purpose of improving the health and wellbeing of society, our scientific foundation is continually expanding as we engage with health care providers, researchers and consumers:
•Extending upon our collaboration with the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, Sleep Number is funding a research with Mayo Clinic to understand sleep’s impact on health and wellbeing. Together, we hope to amplify our impact on improving society’s overall sleep and wellness and improving patient outcomes. By uniting our sleep knowledge and technology with world-class clinicians and researchers, we aim to make meaningful advancements to the science of sleep, with goals to materially foster better sleep and health for society;
•To support our research endeavors, we founded the Sleep Number Scientific Advisory Board, an interdisciplinary group of physicians, clinicians and researchers with expertise in sleep science and health. Our leadership team works with this collective of internationally-known experts to gather counsel on the latest sleep science and research programs and to leverage their knowledge to innovate new sleep-health solutions; and
•In 2020, we also established several important research and development projects aimed at identifying underlying physiological warning signs of health issues. The new Sleep Science Research capability within the SleepIQ technology platform provides the Company’s smart sleeper community (our “Insiders” – customers and SleepIQ technology users) the opportunity to help advance sleep science with real-world data to understand sleep behaviors and outcomes. By opting in through the SleepIQ® app, 360 smart bed sleepers answer periodic surveys about their health. This self-reported health history is analyzed alongside anonymized and aggregated sleep and biometric data, allowing us to gain additional insights on sleep’s impact on holistic health. It may also inform the development of new products, services and partnerships to advance the science of sleep and possibly even predict future health trends.
This collaboration of our integrated, experienced team, our external partners and our expert advisors will advance sleep research and science, and enable consumers to proactively and comprehensively improve their sleep health through superior sleep solutions.
Exclusive Direct-to-Consumer Distribution
At a time when people are recognizing the importance of sleep to their overall health and wellbeing, Sleep Number is hyper-relevant in consumers’ lives. Not only are we a leader in sleep innovation, we are linking sleep to wellness and creating a future where people live happier, healthier and more productive lives.
Our exclusive, direct-to-consumer distribution model builds lifelong relationships with our customers. We employ technology across our customer touchpoints to deliver a value-added retail experience that integrates our digital and physical touchpoints to meet customer needs, and our mission-driven, highly-trained sleep experts use our best-in-class relationship-based selling process, which is continually tested and refined, to deliver high conversions. We offer an engaging and dynamic online experience, which was heavily optimized in 2020, to educate consumers and advance their purchase path, driving highly-qualified traffic to all our retail touchpoints: Stores, Online, Phone and Chat.
As the exclusive distributor of Sleep Number® products, we target high-quality, convenient and visible store locations based on several factors, including each market’s overall sales potential and store geography, demographics and proximity to other brand experiences. Since 2010, we have invested in repositioning a large percentage of our mall stores to stronger, optimally sized, non-mall locations, adding stores in both existing and new markets. As of January 2, 2021, we operated 602 Sleep Number® stores, with locations in all 50 states. More than 42% of our stores (including remodels) are less than five years old and more than 56% are less than seven years old.
In 2020, our direct-to-consumer model and synergies from our vertical integration as the exclusive designer, manufacturer, marketer, retailer and servicer of Sleep Number® beds enabled us to deliver a better, faster, simpler, safer and more engaging experience for our customers and our team members. In early fiscal April, with forced temporary closures of more than 80% of our stores and sales declining by almost 80% versus the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reinvented our integrated operational processes through fast “test, learn, and apply” exercises, quickly advancing technology and digital capabilities and reskilling frontline teams. We rolled out a “sell-from-anywhere” model, an agile go-to-market approach that leveraged our sleep professionals’ skills in building customer relationships and aligned seamlessly with our customers’ shopping preferences: in-store, online or by phone. These actions drove efficient new customer acquisition, strong average revenue per unit, growth in number of new customers, bed units and increased conversion, producing a sharp recovery in Sleep Number’s sales and profitability.
Our Stores accounted for 85% of net sales in 2020. Average annual net sales per store, based on Total Retail (which includes Stores, Online, Phone and Chat), were $3.1 million in 2020, a new record. In 2020, 67% of our Stores open for a full year generated net sales of greater than $2 million, and 29% of our Stores open for a full year generated more than $3 million in net sales. In 2020, our Online, Phone and Chat sales accounted for 15% of our net sales, representing 108% year-over-year growth.
Brand Communications
Relevant, engaging and individualized communications have helped Sleep Number to become a beloved brand built on a foundation of individuality and wellbeing. Our deep understanding of, and insights about, our target customers, including structural shifts in consumer behavior that we have anticipated since the inception of our consumer innovation strategy in 2012 – and which were accelerated by the global pandemic – have guided our brand marketing strategies. To drive both new customer acquisition and retention (Insiders) business, our brand communications strategies are designed to emotionally connect consumers with high-quality content about the benefits of life-changing sleep and the value of our 360 smart bed: (i) we amplify our brand through strategic partnerships; (ii) we engage consumers seamlessly across multiple touchpoints with an emphasis on digital; and (iii) we create lifelong customer relationships and brand advocacy by delivering an unparalleled sleep experience. Together, these actions result in strong brand health, heightened consumer consideration and engagement, high-quality traffic, and authentic advocacy for Sleep Number’s brand, products and services.
Strategic partnerships amplify the effectiveness, impact and scale of our brand and marketing efforts:
•We are in the third year of our strategic partnership as the Official Sleep and Wellness Partner of the National Football League (NFL) – one of the world’s largest marketing and fan-engagement platforms. Our partnership with the NFL broadens our brand reach, deepens our brand relevance and magnifies the benefits of our proprietary innovations. Most active NFL players now have a Sleep Number 360 smart bed, which helps them compete more effectively by measuring, understanding and maximizing the benefits of a great night’s sleep; and
•Our multi-year partnerships with content platform organizations like Thrive Global and Katie Couric Media also provide opportunities to influence and educate consumers about the benefits of proven quality sleep on a regular basis.
We leverage a sophisticated media mix to drive our performance-marketing and advertising communications on a local and national scale, contributing to improved media return on investment (ROI). High-profile video, including television and online streaming, is our most efficient media, followed by digital and social platforms. Our world-class, in-house digital capabilities, content marketing, online user experience and data-driven tools give us the flexibility to pivot quickly and optimize media investment, messages and audience by platform in real-time. Our promotional strategy focuses on simplicity and relevance, driving consumers to the brand at the exact time they are seeking a smart bed. In 2020, media expense represented 13.6% of net sales.
We leaned into customer acquisition in 2019 and rapidly accelerated our digital capabilities in early 2020. We strengthened our digital engagement by delivering a superior personalized customer connection with our highly-knowledgeable sleep professionals. A new platform featuring modern, cloud-based architecture accelerated our “sell-from-anywhere” capability that makes it easy for our customers to get the exact Sleep Number solution they are looking for, on their own terms. By the third quarter of 2020, our digital traffic had surpassed all of 2019 and we delivered 80 basis points of leverage in our media spending in that quarter. Overall, 2020 represented our third straight year of double-digit, digital-traffic growth.
We focus on building lifelong relationships with our Insiders. The more deeply engaged our Insiders are with the brand, the greater their advocacy. Our smart sleeper community, now 1.6 million strong, interacts with our brand every day through SleepIQ technology. Our award-winning InnerCircleSM Rewards program amplifies this engagement and drives acquisition of new customers through referral, and greater retention with repeat purchases. We expect brand loyalty to accelerate as we roll out new health and wellness features in SleepIQ technology that will continue to benefit our Insiders’ lives. Insider referral and repeat sales represent greater than 45% of our business and are the most efficient source of new customers to the brand.
Operations
Integrated Sourcing and Logistics
Sleep Number’s integrated supply chain is a competitive advantage. Our commitments to innovation and continuous improvement are employed to leverage our vertical-business model by optimizing culture, processes and technology. In addition to a network of global suppliers, we currently operate two component manufacturing plants (Irmo, SC and Salt Lake City, UT) and four assembly distribution centers (Irmo, SC; Salt Lake City, UT; Ontario, CA; and Baltimore, MD) with two additional locations (Dallas, TX and Tampa, FL) opening in early 2021. Primary operations at the manufacturing sites include cutting and sewing of the fabric covers for our beds and final assembly and packaging of mattresses and bases. We also assemble our electrical Firmness Control™ systems in our Utah plant. Our plants have consistently won awards for safety and manufacturing excellence. We also operate a national bedding fulfillment center in Minneapolis, MN.
We source the raw materials and components used in our products from third parties. Various components are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as our sole or primary source of supply. We believe we can obtain these raw materials and components from other sources of supply, although we could experience short-term disruption in order fulfillment in the event of an unexpected loss of supply. We have taken, and continue to take, various measures to mitigate the potential impact of an unexpected supply disruption from any sole-source or primary suppliers, including maintaining safety stocks and identifying potential alternate suppliers. Our key suppliers have in place either contingency or disaster recovery plans or redundant production capabilities to minimize any unforeseen disasters.
At the end of 2020, approximately 50% of our smart beds were pre-assembled for delivery to customers’ homes while the remaining deliveries were assembled in customers’ homes. We are pursuing a multi-year evolution of our supply chain to pre-assemble 100% of our beds in as many as eight planned assembly distribution centers around the U.S. by 2022. We are advancing our outbound logistics network to reduce product handling, hand-offs, damage and costs while in transit to customers’ homes. We see these initiatives providing a superior and reliable experience for customers with lower costs for the business.
Home Delivery Service
Our home delivery teams are another direct touchpoint with our customers. Since 2018, 100% of our 360 smart beds sold are delivered and installed by our home delivery technicians or by our third-party service providers.
Our home delivery teams across the nation embraced the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, adopting measures to safeguard customer and team member health, while ensuring that customers were still able to receive the quality sleep they needed.
Customer Service
Through our U.S.-based, in-house customer service team located in Minneapolis, MN and New Orleans, LA, we provide direct post-purchase support that improves the customer experience and drives our business. Through frequent service and support interactions with customers via phone, email, live chat and social media, these team members also provide a unique opportunity to gather insights that help us continuously improve our products, strengthen our service quality and advance our innovation. This integration enables operational synergies and drives organizational efficiencies.
Throughout the pandemic, serving our customers remained our focus. In order to keep our team members safe, yet continue to provide a superior customer experience, our customer service teams in Minneapolis and New Orleans were provided with the technology tools and training to work from home.
Information Systems
We use information technology systems to operate, analyze and manage our business, to reduce operating costs and to enhance our customers’ experience. Our major systems include an in-store order entry system, a retail portal system, a payment processing system, in-bound and out-bound telecommunications systems for direct marketing, delivery scheduling and customer service, e-commerce systems, a data warehouse system and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. These systems are primarily comprised of packaged applications licensed from various software vendors plus a limited number of internally developed programs.
Intellectual Property
We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of our products, including air control systems, remote control systems, air chamber features, mattress construction, foundation systems, sensing systems, automated adjustments, in-bed temperature control, as well as other technology. We have numerous U.S. patents, expiring at various dates between July 2021 and April 2039, and numerous U.S. patent applications pending. We also have numerous foreign patents and patent applications pending. Notwithstanding these patents and patent applications, we cannot ensure that these patent rights will provide substantial protection or that others will not be able to develop products that are similar to, or competitive with, our products.
We have a number of trademarks and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including Sleep Number®, SleepIQ®, Sleep Number 360®, 360®, SleepIQ Kids®, the Double Arrow logo, Select Comfort®, AirFit®, BAM Labs®, the “B” logo, Comfortaire®, ComfortFit®, Comfort.Individualized.®, Does Your Bed Do That?®, the DualTemp logo, the DualAir Technology Inside logo, FlexTop®, IndividualFit®, It®, Know Better Sleep®, Pillow[ology]®, PillowFit®, Probably the Best Bed in the World®, Responsive Air®, Sleep Is Training®, Sleep Number Inner Circle®, Sleep30®, Smart Bed For Smart Kids®, Tech-e®, The Only Bed 
That Grows With Them®, This Is Not A Bed®, Tonight Bedtime. Tomorrow The World®, We Make Beds Smart® and What’s Your Sleep Number?®. We have several trademarks that are the subject of pending applications, including Auto Snore™, Climate360™, EnviroIQ™, HealthIQ™, HeartIQ™, Individualized Sleep Experiences™, RespiratoryIQ™, Retail Flow™, Sleep Number Labs logo, Sleep Number Labs Sleep For The Future logo, and WellnessIQ™. Each registered mark is renewable indefinitely as long as the mark remains in use and/or is not deemed to be invalid or canceled.

Several of our trademarks have been registered, or are the subject of pending applications for registration, in various foreign countries. We also have other intellectual property rights related to our products, processes and technologies, including trade secrets, trade dress and copyrights. We protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including through litigation as necessary.
Industry and Competition
Sleep disorders have been declared a public health epidemic by the U.S. Center for Disease Control. One in three adults suffer from a lack of adequate sleep. Sleep Number is focused on producing products to address this growing problem. The total U.S. sleep-health economy was estimated to be $30 billion to $40 billion in a 2017 report published by McKinsey & Company. This reflects the traditional view of the bedding industry which includes the sales of mattresses and foundations, as well as emerging solutions for insufficient sleep such as routine modification and therapeutic treatment. We believe the sleep economy will continue to evolve and grow as consumers look for products and reliable data sources to address sleep deprivation challenges.
The traditional view of the U.S. bedding industry, including mattresses and foundations (static and adjustable), is measured through data provided by the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA). According to ISPA, the industry has grown by approximately 4% annually over the last 20 years, including 4% annually, on average, over the past five years. According to ISPA and our estimates, industry wholesale shipments of mattresses and foundations (including imported products and adjustable bases) were approximately $10.9 billion in 2020 (approximately $22 billion at retail).
The retail bedding industry is commoditized and highly competitive. Sleep Number competes against regional and local specialty bedding retailers, home furnishing stores, mass merchants, national discount stores and online marketers. Furniture/Today, a furniture industry trade publication, has ranked Sleep Number as the 5th largest mattress manufacturer and 2nd largest U.S. bedding retailer for 2019, with an estimated 8% market share of industry retail revenue. Our consumer innovation strategy with proprietary sleep innovations and exclusive direct-to-consumer distribution is highly differentiated, resulting in lifelong customer relationships and contributing to our continued profitable growth.
Manufacturers in the bedding industry compete through retail partners on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance, including the perceived levels of comfort and support provided by a mattress. There is a high degree of concentration among manufacturers, who produce innerspring, memory foam and hybrid beds, under nationally recognized brand names, including Tempur Sealy, Stearns & Foster, Serta and Simmons. In recent years, numerous direct-to-consumer companies and low-cost importers have entered the market, offering “bed-in-a-box” products to consumers, primarily through online distribution though many now partner with traditional mattress retailers. Their products are generally foam-based and undifferentiated in terms of sleep benefits.
Governmental Regulation and Compliance
As a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting all aspects of our business.
As a manufacturer, we are committed to product quality and safety, including adherence to all applicable laws and regulations affecting our products and services. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including the federal fire retardant standards developed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which requires rigorous and costly testing, has increased the cost and complexity of manufacturing our products and may adversely impact the speed and cost of product development efforts. Further, our manufacturing, distribution, delivery and other business operations and facilities are subject to additional federal, state or local laws or regulations including supply chain transparency, conflict minerals sourcing and disclosure, end-of-life disposal and recycling requirements, transportation and other laws or regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety requirements, including COVID-19 safety and prevention.
As a retailer, we are subject to additional laws and regulations that apply to retailers generally and govern the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of both our retail stores and our e-commerce activities. Many of the statutory and regulatory requirements that impact our retail and e-commerce operations are consumer-focused and pertain to activities such as our promotions, advertising claims, pricing, credit-based promotional offers, truth-in-advertising, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, text messaging requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements, accessibility and similar requirements.
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local labor laws including, but not limited to, those relating to occupational health and safety, employee privacy, wage and hour, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity and employee leaves and benefits. We are also subject to existing and emerging federal and state laws relating to data security and privacy.
It is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance.
Seasonality
Our business is modestly impacted by seasonal influences inherent in the U.S. bedding industry and general retail shopping patterns. The U.S. bedding industry generally experiences lower sales in the second quarter of the calendar year and increased sales during selected holiday or promotional periods.
Working Capital
We are able to operate with minimal working capital requirements because we sell directly to customers, utilize a primarily hybrid “make-to-stock” production process and operate retail stores that serve mainly as showrooms. We have historically generated sufficient cash flows to self-fund operations through an accelerated cash-conversion cycle. Our Credit Agreement provides a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with net aggregate availability of $450 million. The Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the amount of the credit facility from $450 million up to $600 million in total availability, subject to Lenders’ approval. The Credit Agreement matures in February 2024.
Qualified customers are offered revolving credit to finance purchases through a private-label consumer credit facility provided by Synchrony Bank. Approximately 52% of our net sales in 2020 were financed by Synchrony Bank. Our current agreement with Synchrony Bank expires December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination upon certain events. We pay Synchrony Bank a fee for extended credit promotional financing offers. Under the terms of our agreement, Synchrony Bank sets the minimum acceptable credit ratings, interest rates, fees and all other terms and conditions of the customers’ accounts, including collection policies and procedures. As the receivables are owned by Synchrony Bank, at no time are the receivables purchased or acquired from us. We are not liable to Synchrony Bank for our customers’ credit defaults. In connection with all purchases financed under these arrangements, Synchrony Bank pays us an amount equal to the total amount of such purchases, net of promotional related discounts, upon delivery to the customer. Customers that do not qualify for credit under our agreement with Synchrony Bank may apply for credit under a secondary program that we offer through another provider.
Human Capital
Our Team Members
Individuality is our foundation. Our Company was founded under the name Select Comfort in 1987 (public company since 1998), on the premise that “one size doesn’t fit all.” We celebrate individuality in each other, in our own lives and in our customer’s lives. We strive to embrace every individual’s unique talents, perspectives and experiences, as we create an environment where we can be our best selves. Valuing diversity, equity and inclusion makes us stronger, smarter and fuels our innovation and teamwork. Individuality connects us to our vision of becoming one of the world’s most beloved brands by delivering an unparalleled sleep experience.
Throughout 2020, our purpose sustained us, inspired us and informed our business decisions and actions, including gifting a smart bed to all of our team members, partnering with Make-A-Wish to support critically ill children with life changing sleep and joining the United Nations Global Compact. At January 2, 2021, we employed a total of 4,679 team members, of which 108 were employed on a part-time or temporary basis. The breakdown of team members by area was as follows: 2,250 in retail sales and support, 833 in field services, 408 in customer service, 497 in manufacturing and logistics, and 691 in technology, corporate, management and administrative positions.
Talent Management
Our team members make a difference every day in improving society’s health and wellbeing through higher quality sleep. We engage our team members with an inclusive culture that is built on individuality and wellbeing. We celebrate individuality in each other, in our own lives and in our customers’ lives. We embrace every individual’s unique talents, perspectives and experiences and strive to create an environment where we can be our best selves. Valuing diversity, equity and inclusion makes us stronger, smarter and fuels our innovation and teamwork. Individuality connects us to our vision of becoming one of the world’s most beloved brands by delivering an unparalleled sleep experience. 
Our culture embraces the shared values of passion, integrity, innovation, courage and teamwork. These values are central to who we are as a team and our ability to attract, engage, motivate and retain talent. Our holistic approach to talent management, as described below, is critical to the execution of our consumer innovation strategy. Talent management at Sleep Number is not a cyclical process but instead is a continuous lifecycle centered on learning and development. It comes to life through a 70/20/10 learning philosophy: (i) 70% of learning is on-the-job; (ii) 20% happens through managers, peers and others; and (iii) 10% is formal training or development. Our leaders have a strong commitment to seeing that this approach to talent management is successfully carried out every day. Some of the metrics that we use to gauge our progress include:
•We track numerous talent recruitment metrics to advance brand awareness and drive candidate traffic. This is used in our diversity hiring efforts. We also track retention and turnover of team members, including new hires on a monthly, quarterly and rolling 12-month basis. This is used to identify patterns and formulate talent strategies;
•We have a demographics dashboard that tracks race/ethnicity and gender by job grade, tenure and generation. This helps provide leaders with visibility to our progress on goals for diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). In 2020, we established a 13-member council of Sleep Number team members to advise the Company on advancing our DE&I initiatives;
•We have a continuous listening strategy to ensure we stay connected to the voice of our team members at critical times of the team member experience. The key survey touchpoints are at new hire, pulse check-in, annual engagement and exit. This allows leaders to monitor team member sentiment and key engagement metrics including an inclusion and belonging index. We also conducted a self-identification survey to learn how our team members identify and how they want to be appreciated as individuals;
•We benchmark at least annually all aspects of our total rewards program for team members. This ensures that we maintain a competitive rewards offering which is unique because all team members participate in some type of variable pay program (e.g., bonus, commissions) in addition to base pay. Our benefits package has been greatly expanded to support team member wellbeing including higher quality sleep by providing all 4,700 of our team members with a Sleep Number 360 smart bed in 2020, and a commitment to do so for all new Sleep Number team members going forward;
•We utilize our human capital management (HCM) system to track and follow team member performance assessments and development plans. We use our HCM system to monitor the completion of learning courses for our team members. Our enterprise learning management system provides all team members access to a training curriculum that is dynamic and mobile-accessible; and
•We collect and analyze workplace injury and accident information across all our locations. This enables our commitment to safety and dedication to reduce incident rates, number of workers’ compensation claims and lost workdays.
Social Impact Commitment
At Sleep Number, our purpose is to improve the health and wellbeing of society through higher quality sleep. We are committed to leveraging the power of sleep, and sleep science, to improve lives and create a healthier, kinder, more inclusive world. And because of our team’s dedication to our mission, disciplined execution of our vertically integrated business model and differentiated consumer innovation strategy, Sleep Number is at the forefront of delivering this life-changing benefit. With our revolutionary Sleep Number 360®  smart beds and SleepIQ®  technology, we have improved 13 million lives.
In 2018, we announced a social impact commitment to help one million young people achieve life-changing sleep through our products and sleep expertise by 2025. In 2020, we expanded our focus to broadly support children, families and communities, especially those who were deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and social injustices. Our 2020 cash donations totaled over $600,000, and our team members donated their time and efforts to support individuals and families in need in their surrounding communities.
We improved the lives of nearly 100,000 individuals through continued partnerships with organizations including GENYOUth, Blue Star Families, American Cancer Society, Bridging and others. Additionally, we established new partnerships to make a greater 
positive impact. On Giving Tuesday 2020, we announced a year-long partnership with Make-A-Wish to help critically ill Wish kids across the United States receive the quality sleep they need by providing new 360 smart beds. We also made a financial contribution to the National Urban League to support its important work to improve equality for Black Americans. In addition, because the health and wellbeing of our team members is a high priority, we provided all 4,700 Sleep Number team members with the gift of quality sleep in 2020, presenting each with a new Sleep Number 360 smart bed.
While our pioneering and award-winning innovations are designed to improve people's health and wellbeing through quality sleep, Sleep Number was able to improve the health and safety of frontline health-care workers in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in a different way. By leveraging resources at our Irmo South Carolina plant in early 2020, our manufacturing team supported the South Carolina Hospital Association by refurbishing nearly 50,000 N95 masks, fulfilling a much-needed supply amidst a personal protective equipment shortage.
