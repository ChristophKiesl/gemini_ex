 Business Developments
 
  Corporate Restructuring
 
 Because we were not able to raise additional capital from investors in the fourth quarter of 2016 we were forced to enter into settlements with our creditors and note holders and restructure the Company. This restructuring caused us to curtail certain business operations and change our focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for the alternative financing in the small and medium enterprise (“SME”) market to the licensing of available software packages for which we own or license the intellectual property.
 
 The revised business model requires fewer employees, advisors and consultants and is more economical to operate than our past operations. Over the past few years we have developed several software products suitable for the alternative market which we continue to offer to and operate with third parties. Such products and related services include white label versions of crowdfunding software for investor groups and monitoring software to provide investors with ongoing insight into the performance of SMEs to which they have loaned money. Related licensing fees and subscription agreements may include set fees and yearly contribution fees.
 
 Our goal is to limit our debt, continue to operate our business and negotiate a possible acquisition or other business combination with another operating entity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor or that if a business combination is consummated that it will be on favorable terms. In the interim, we are continuing forward with our business operations under the revised business model.
 
 As the result of the restructuring, our previous crowdfunding platform in the Netherlands will be operated through Symbid Coöperatie UA (“Symbid Coöp”) and we will no longer receive revenues from Symbid Coöp. We previously controlled and operated Symbid Coöp through corporate governance but as the result of the restructuring, Symbid Coöp has become an independent entity. As we did not have the resources available to continue the software development of the online funding platform, Symbid Coöp developed the software for operating the crowdfunding platform under the laws and regulations of The Netherlands. Symbid Coöp has, in return for reimbursing the further development of the software, been granted a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property from Stichting Symbid IP Foundation in order to continue crowdfunding operations in The Netherlands. We will continue to hold an identical non-exclusive license to the intellectual property of the crowdfunding platform whereby we will be allowed to use the most up to date versions of the software and other intellectual property.

 On July 1, 2016, each of Korstiaan Zandvliet, our Chief Executive Officer and President, Maarten van der Sanden, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Robin Slakhorst, our former Vice President, and Jeroen Bontje, a former key employee, executed amendments to their respective employment agreements reducing their respective base annual net salaries by approximately 50% to €19,200. No other changes were made to such employment agreements at that time.

 Effective October 12, 2016, each of our then executive officers, Korstiaan Zandvliet, Maarten van der Sanden and Robin Slakhorst, executed amendments to their respective employment agreements pursuant to which each executive agreed to have their base salaries reduced to zero retroactive to August 1, 2016. No other changes were made to the employment agreements at that time.
 
  Debt Restructuring
 
 On November 1, 2016 Symbid B.V. entered into agreements with Symbid Coöp and persons having employment agreements with Symbid B.V., providing for the termination of all Symbid B.V. employment agreements and the entry into new agreements between such employees and Symbid Coöp.
 
 On November 15, 2016, we entered into a Note Termination and Conversion Agreement with each of the holders of our 2016 3-year, 8% unsecured convertible notes (the “2016 Notes”), pursuant to which the holders agreed to the termination of their 2016 Notes in exchange for their receipt of equity participation rights in Symbid Coöp. An aggregate of $550,000 in principal amount of 2016 Notes together with all accrued interest due thereon was cancelled and participation rights representing an aggregate of 18.75% of the equity in Symbid Coöp was issued.
 
 On November 15, 2016, we entered into a Note Termination and Conversion Agreement with each of the holders of our 2015 3-year 8% unsecured convertible notes (the “2015 Notes”) pursuant to which the holders agreed to the termination of their respective 2015 Notes in exchange for equity participation rights in Symbid Coöp and/or a right of first refusal with respect to any direct or indirect activities of Symbid Corp. and related entities. Right of First Refusal Agreement (“ROFRA”) requires Symbid Corp. and related parties to inform the note holder in the form of a written detailed business plan of any asset management activities or operations in the SME market to be undertaken by Symbid group companies. Symbid Corp. or any of the related entities is required to provide marketing plans 60 days before asset activities or operations begin. The investor will have a 15 day grace period to veto or refuse such activities to be undertaken by Symbid group or related parties. The ROFRA has a term which runs through December 31, 2020. As to Symbid Corp., the right of first refusal terminates if and when there is a change in control of Symbid Corp. involving another entity with business activities different from those currently undertaken by Symbid Corp. In connection with the foregoing, one note holder of $1,175,000 in principal amount of 2015 Notes agreed to receive the right of first refusal executed on November 15, 2016, in combination with an equity participation in Symbid Coöp while all of the other holders agreed to receive equity participation rights in Symbid Coöp. An aggregate of $1,310,000 in principal amount of 2015 Notes together with all accrued interest due thereon was cancelled and participation rights representing an aggregate of 6.5% of the equity in Symbid Coöp was issued. The Note Termination and Conversion Agreements also provided for the termination of pre-emptive rights which holders of the 2015 Notes had been granted in connection with their purchases of 2015 Notes.
 
 On November 15, 2016 Symbid B.V. entered into an agreement with Voyager Beheer BV (“Voyager”) and Symbid Coöp which provided for the termination of a September 15, 2011 €66,950 promissory note from Symbid B.V. to Voyager, including all accrued interest due thereon, in consideration of the grant to Voyager of a 1.33% equity participation in Symbid Coöp.
 
 On November 15, 2016 Symbid B.V. entered into an agreement with Rabobank Leiden-Katwijk (“Rabobank”), IP Foundation and Symbid Coöp pursuant to which Symbid B.V.’s outstanding €52,959 debt to Rabobank and all accrued interest due thereon are to be transferred to and assumed by Symbid Coöp. The agreement further provided that a related line of credit with an amount due of €60,500 be assumed by Symbid Coöp.
 
 On November 15, 2016 Symbid Coöp assumed certain debts and obligations from Symbid B.V. in consideration of cancellation of the current account between Symbid B.V. and Symbid Coöp and office furniture from Symbid B.V. to be obtained in return by Symbid Coöp, under the suspending condition that all other debts and obligations of Symbid B.V. are settled, with the exception of any liabilities owed to Symbid Corp. or Symbid Holding B.V. by Symbid B.V.

 On November 18, 2016 we settled approximately €101,000 in debts with two creditors through agreements with Symbid Coöp under which the creditors agreed to the termination of the debts in consideration of receiving equity participation in Symbid Coöp aggregating to 5% of Symbid Coöp.
 
  License Agreements
 
 On November 15, 2016 Symbid B.V. and Symbid Coöp entered into an Intellectual Property License Termination Agreement which terminated the April 13, 2011 License Agreement between them retroactive to November 1, 2016.
 
 On November 15, 2016 IP Foundation and Symbid Holding executed Addendum 2 to their Intellectual Property License and Transfer Agreement dated October 16, 2013 to enable IP Foundation to grant a non-exclusive license to Symbid Coöp in return for Symbid Coöp’s bearing the costs for the further development of the related software, intellectual property rights and know-how. This was done in recognition of the fact that Symbid Holding is no longer able to continue development of the software in compliance with applicable Netherlands laws and regulations due the financial distressed situation of the Company.
 
 On November 15, 2016 Symbid Coöp and IP Foundation entered into an Intellectual Property License and Transfer Agreement (the “Agreement”) with retroactive effect to November 1, 2016 pursuant to which IP Foundation granted Symbid Coöp a perpetual, royalty free license which included the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates of Symbid Coöp to use the Symbid online crowdfunding platform to conduct crowdfunding business worldwide and to further develop and maintain the platform. Any sublicenses granted to Symbid Coöp affiliates are required to provide for the subsequent transfer of any intellectual property rights and know how relating to the Symbid platform created by such affiliates to Symbid Coöp. In the Agreement, Symbid Coöp acknowledged and agreed that all intellectual property rights and other ownership rights in the intellectual property would remain with IP Foundation.
 
 On November 15, 2016 we settled approximately €15,000 in debts with one creditor through a settlement agreement. The creditor is the owner of the FAC monitoring technology intellectual property rights for which we hold through our wholly owned subsidiary FAC B.V. the exclusive perpetual worldwide free of charge license. In consideration of the settlement of €15,000, the terms of the license were changed to a non-exclusive perpetual worldwide free of charge license.
 
  Officer/Director Resignation
 
 Robin Slakhorst resigned as our Chief Commercial Officer and as a Director effective the close of business on November 15, 2016. The resignation of Mr. Slakhorst was not the result of any disagreement with us on any matter related to our operations, policies or practices.
 
  Going Concern Qualification
 
 Our expenses have outpaced our revenues since our inception causing liquidity issues and raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In recognition thereof, we have implemented strategies to reduce expenses and restructure our operations. Such restructuring, as described elsewhere in this Report, has caused us to curtail certain of our operations and change our business focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for the alternative financing market for the SME market to the licensing of available software packages for which we own or license the intellectual property.

  Company Background
 
 Founded in The Netherlands in April 2011 as the provider of one of the first crowdfunding platforms, our business evolved in 2015 into a fully integrated, data driven, user friendly online funding network consisting of several products and services known as The Funding Network™. The Funding Network™ is intended to give SMEs direct access to all forms of finance, while offering investors full transparency on the potential risks and return of their portfolios and was developed in response to the following funding hurdles affecting entrepreneurs and investors in general and SMEs in particular:
 
   ●
 Limited or no structured distribution channels for SME finance other than banks, increasing the mismatch between entrepreneurs and financiers;


   ●
 No centralized platform for (alternative) financiers, making it difficult and inefficient to find the right financier at the right time;


   ●
 No standardized data protocols for SME data, leading to costly and time-intensive (offline) screening and monitoring;


   ●
 Limited financial skills of entrepreneurs leading to unnecessary inefficiencies and obstacles within the financing process; and


   ●
 Decline in bank financing due to new regulations and recent financial crises, leaving a vacuum in the life cycle of SME financing.


 Since 2011, we have been a Dutch leader in equity-based crowdfunding having funded 120 SME’s with over EUR 14.4 million (approximately $15 million) in total crowdfunding volume since inception.
 
 As the result of our corporate restructuring, we no longer offer crowdfunding services in the Netherlands or elsewhere.
 
 Our online funding operations through The Funding Network™ are intended to address the decreasing availability of traditional bank financing options to SMEs in Europe and elsewhere. We are an early mover in online funding having developed in-house investing and monitoring technologies designed to create efficiently structured capital market funding solutions. We believe that we are presently the only European based online funding platform to offer proprietary equity, loan and high quality monitoring services to private SMEs. Certain competitors offer comparable funding services but do not include monitoring services. Others provide equity and loan funding services plus high quality monitoring services but do not currently possess a proprietary user base or internal payment method.
 
 On December 8, 2014 we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with Fortion Holding B.V., a Netherlands limited liability corporation conducting its business under the trade name Credion (“Credion”). Credion provides financial advisory services in the Dutch SME markets and specializes in debt and equity financings for SMEs. The Agreement provides for a strategic alliance between us and Credion in which Credion’s extensive network of investors and entrepreneurs will be connected with each other through our online funding platform. Credion will process the funding for its SME clients through our platform resulting in monthly recurring revenue and transaction fees for us. The alliance is intended to provide more efficient access to capital for SMEs while greatly improving SME data monitoring standards for investors. SMEs utilizing the platform will have direct access to Credion’s investor clients as well as our investors.

 Prior to November 2016, Symbid Coöp was the contractor for all of our crowdfunding business in the Netherlands. We did not own or have any interest in Symbid Coöp. Symbid Coöp was a variable interest entity (“VIE”) which we, through Symbid B.V., effectively controlled through corporate governance rather than through any ownership. Because we owned no interest in Symbid Coöp, we had no right to receive any distributions from Symbid Coöp. The revenues to us from Symbid Coöp came from administrative, success and management fees paid to us by Symbid Coöp. Because of the corporate governance control structure, we consolidated the financial statements of Symbid Coöp with our own. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 90% and 80% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from Symbid Coöp. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had net losses of $1,507,652 and $2,299,275, respectively.
 
 In August 2014 we incorporated in Germany our indirect, majority owned, subsidiary Symbid Germany GmbH. We contributed capital of $7,749 to this subsidiary, which is currently an entity without operations.
 
 Further to the planned European expansion of our equity crowdfunding operations, on February 20, 2015, Symbid Italia SPA (“Symbid Italia”), an Italian corporation created to develop the business of equity crowdfunding in Italy, was formed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., together with Banca Sella Holding SPA (“Banca Sella”) and Marco Bicocchi Pichi. Through Symbid Italia, we intended to create a new online funding platform, based on our existing crowdfunding technology, in which Italian investors and entrepreneurs could connect, fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for Italian SME’s. At the direction of the Symbid Italia board of directors, a special Symbid Italia shareholder meeting was held on April 29, 2016, at which it was determined to liquidate Symbid Italia and return the residual capital to the Symbid Italia shareholders. On May 26, 2016, Symbid Italia was liquidated and the Company received $44,922 for its 50.1% interest and recognized a loss of $2,986. The results of Symbid Italia’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements
 
 In June 2015, our loan crowdfunding program was launched, and in the beginning of July 2015 our first successful loan crowdfunding campaign was realized. The launch of this peer-to-business lending service complemented our existing equity crowdfunding service and supported the development of our online funding platform for start-ups and SME’s, The Funding Network.
 
 To operate the loan crowdfunding Symbid Coöp obtained an exemption to mediate in redeemable funds from the Dutch Authority Financial Markets.
 
  Overview
 
 We were incorporated as HapyKidz.com, Inc. in Nevada on July 28, 2011 with the intention to become an e-commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers by offering daily discounts on goods and services through a proprietary website. We were not successful in this endeavor.
 
 On September 4, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from HapyKidz.com, Inc. to Symbid Corp.
 
 On December 6, 2013, we closed a share exchange (the “Share Exchange”) pursuant to which the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 21,170,000 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Symbid Holding B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours.
 
 As the result of the Share Exchange, we became engaged in the business of creating and operating online, equity based crowdfunding platforms, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V. In 2015, we expanded our operations to include an online platform for SME funding, connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around our technology or elsewhere. As the result of the corporate restructuring in November 2016, we no longer offer crowdfunding services in the Netherlands or elsewhere.

 In connection with the Share Exchange and pursuant to a December 6, 2013 Split-Off Agreement (the “Split-Off Agreement”), we transferred our pre-Share Exchange business to Holli Morris, our pre-Share Exchange majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender by her and cancellation of 187,500,000 shares of our Common Stock.
 
 As a result of the Share Exchange and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Share Exchange business and acquired the business of Symbid Holding B.V. and we have continued the existing business operations of Symbid Holding B.V. as a publicly-traded company under the name Symbid Corp.
 
 Also on December 6, 2013, we completed an initial closing of a private placement offering of 3,098,736 units at $0.50 per unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,549,368 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the offering estimated at approximately $64,895). Each of these units consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. The warrants were exercisable for a period of three (3) years at a purchase price of $0.75 per share. The private placement was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in reliance upon the exemptions provided by Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The private placement was sold to “accredited investors,” as defined in Regulation D and/or to “non-U.S. Persons” in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. On February 5, 2014, we completed a second closing of the private placement for aggregate additional gross proceeds of $186,992. On May 20, 2014, we completed a third and final closing of the private placement for aggregate additional gross proceeds of $1,190,405.
 
 The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes and Symbid Holding B.V. was considered the acquiror for accounting purposes.
 
 In accordance with “reverse acquisition” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the Share Exchange have been replaced with the historical financial statements of Symbid Holding B.V. prior to the Share Exchange in our post Share Exchange filings with the SEC.
 
 Prior to the Share Exchange, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result of the Share Exchange, we ceased to be a shell company.
 
 On January 28, 2015, we completed the initial closing under a private placement offering in which we offered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share. In connection therewith, we sold 1,248,232 shares for aggregate proceeds of $624,116. Effective June 30, 2015, we sold an additional 200,000 shares for aggregate proceeds of $100,000 and completed the offering.
 
 On July 14, 2015 and September 8, 2015, we closed on the sale of $250,000 and $1,250,000, respectively, in principal amount of three-year, 8% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the “Notes”). Interest was payable on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance date. At any time after issuance, the holders could, at their option, convert all or a portion of the principal and interest then due into shares of common stock at a price of $0.25 per share. On July 14, 2015, we received conversion notices from four persons holding an aggregate of $190,000 in principal amount of Notes of their determination to convert all of such principal into an aggregate of 760,000 shares and subsequently issued such shares. As set forth under Debt Restructuring above, the balance of the Notes were terminated on November 15, 2016 pursuant to Note Termination and Conversion Agreements.
 
 On June 1, 2016, we closed on the sale of $550,000 in principal amount of three-year 8% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the “2016 Notes”). Interest was payable on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance date. If, during the term of the 2016 Notes, we completed an equity offering (a “Qualified Offering”) for gross proceeds of not less than $1,500,000, the holders could, at their option, convert all or a portion of the principal and interest then due into shares of common stock at a price per share equal to 50% of the price at which our common stock was sold in the Qualified Offering. As set forth under Debt Restructuring above, the 2016 Notes were terminated on November 15, 2016 pursuant to Note Termination and Conversion Agreements.

 On December 9, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with CKR Law LLP (“CKR”) pursuant to which we issued 149,863,484 shares of our restricted common stock to CKR and its designees for (i) the cancellation of an aggregate of $86,456.41 due from the Company to CKR for legal services and expense reimbursements; (ii) a cash payment of $43,614 and (iii) the commitment of CKR to fund certain future operating expenses of the Company.
 
 Although Symbid Holding B.V., Symbid B.V. and their subsidiaries maintain their books and records in their functional currency, the Euro (“EUR” or “€”), the currency of The Netherlands, for financial reporting purposes Symbid Corp. uses the United States dollar (“U.S. dollars,” “USD” or “$”). For purposes of describing metrics or certain business related numbers in the Business description or MD&A Section an exchange rate of $1.05 for €1 as of December 31, 2016 has been applied.
 
  Share Exchange and Related Transactions
 
  Share Exchange Agreement
 
 On December 6, 2013 we, Symbid Holding B.V. and the shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), which closed on the same date. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 21,170,000 shares of our Common Stock. As a result of the Share Exchange, Symbid Holding B.V. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.
 
 Prior to the Share Exchange, we ceased being an e-commerce marketplace that offered daily discounts on goods and services through a proprietary website and became a “shell company”. Pursuant to the Share Exchange, we acquired the business of Symbid Holding B.V., to engage in the creation and operation of online investment “crowd funding” platforms.
 
 At the closing of the Share Exchange, an aggregate of 11,400,000 shares of our Common Stock were issued to the holders of Symbid Holding B.V.’s common stock and 9,770,000 shares of our Common Stock were delivered in escrow, 600,000 of which were initially being held in escrow in accordance with the indemnification provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement. The remaining 9,170,000 shares in escrow were being held in connection with Symbid’s prospective acquisitions of additional interests in Gambitious B.V. and Equidam Holding B.V. On June 6, 2014 we determined not to proceed with the purchase of additional shares in Gambitious B.V. As a consequence, thereof, 5,000,000 of the 9,170,000 shares, representing the shares which had been allocated to the prospective purchase of additional shares of Gambitious B.V. were returned from escrow and subsequently cancelled. An additional 300,000 shares allocated to our existing ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. at the time of the Share Exchange were similarly returned from escrow and subsequently cancelled due to the reduction in our indirect ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. from 18% to 12%. 600,000 of the shares of our common stock delivered into escrow and allocated to our existing ownership in Gambitious B.V. were distributed to the former shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., subject to a 5% hold back to further secure the indemnification obligations of the former Symbid Holding B.V. shareholders under the Share Exchange Agreement. The 5% hold back shares were subsequently released from escrow.
 
 On September 2, 2014 we determined not to proceed with the purchase of additional shares of Equidam Holding B.V. Until March 2017, we held a 7% ownership interest in Equidam Holding B.V. which we sold for EUR 15,000. Until August 2014, we held a 9% ownership interest in Equidam Holding B.V., which was diluted in connection with an equity financing by Equidam Holding B.V. in which we determined not to participate. As a consequence of the foregoing, the 3,000,000 shares of our common stock allocated to the prospective purchase of additional shares of Equidam Holding B.V. delivered into escrow were returned to us and cancelled. 270,000 of the shares of our common stock delivered into escrow and allocated to our existing ownership interest in Equidam Holding B.V. were distributed to the former shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., subject to a 5% holdback to further secure the indemnification obligations of the former Symbid Holding B.V. shareholders under the Share Exchange Agreement. The 5% hold back shares we subsequently released from escrow.
 
   
8


  
 
 On February 9, 2015, we sold our remaining 12% interest in Gambitious B.V. for €18,000 due to Gambitious B.V. having incurred continuing losses in 2014, Gambitious B.V. having switched its business focus to that of the publishing of games, Gambitious B.V. requiring capital contributions from its existing owners and Gambitious B.V. no longer constituting a strategic fit with our evolving operations.
 
 The Share Exchange Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties were subject to customary indemnification provisions, subject to specified aggregate limits of liability.
 
 In connection with the Share Exchange, the parties took all actions necessary to ensure that the Share Exchange was treated as a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
 The issuance of shares of our common stock to holders of Symbid Holding B.V.’s capital stock in connection with the Share Exchange was not registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC under that section. These securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
 
  2013 Equity Incentive Plan
 
 Before the Share Exchange, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), which provides for the issuance of incentive awards of up to 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to officers, key employees, consultants and directors. For a description of the awards made under the 2013 Plan, see “Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans”.
 Forward Stock Split
 
 We effected a 25-for-1 forward stock split on our common stock in the form of a dividend with a record date of September 16, 2013 and a payment date of September 17, 2013. All share amounts referenced in this Annual Report, including those applicable to periods prior to the forward stock split, give effect to the forward stock split unless otherwise indicated.
 FAC B.V. Acquisition
 
 On July 29, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., and FAC 2 B.V., a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands.  Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired FAC B.V. (“Acquiree”), a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands from FAC 2 B.V. in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of our restricted common stock.  Acquiree owns a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we have developed a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for SME’s, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands.  Acquiree was formed by FAC 2 B.V. for the specific purpose of holding the license and has no customers, employees, operations or revenues. Acquiree’s only assets are its proprietary software and technology.
 Fortion Agreement
 
 On December 8, 2014 we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with Fortion Holding B.V., a Netherlands limited liability corporation conducting its business under the trade name Credion (“Credion”). Credion provides financial advisory services in the Dutch SME markets and specializes in debt and equity financings for SMEs. The Agreement provides for a strategic alliance between us and Credion in which Credion’s extensive network of investors and entrepreneurs will be connected with each other through an online funding platform of ours. Credion will process the funding for its SME clients through our platform resulting in monthly recurring revenue and transaction fees for us. The alliance is intended to provide more efficient access to capital for SMEs while greatly improving SME data monitoring standards for investors. SMEs utilizing the platform will have direct access to Credion’s investor clients as well as our investors.

 We will charge SMEs utilizing the platform a service fee for the start package related thereto (€350) with part of such fee being utilized to purchase advisory services from Credion in its capacity as a preferred supplier.
 
 Financing proposals generated by Credion within the platform can be offered to investors (i) by means of a private placement with the professional financing parties affiliated by service level agreements or (ii) by means of an offer on the online direct funding platform enabling investors to invest online utilizing standardized financial products. For (i) above, the settlement of potential transactions will be finalized outside of the platform. For successful transactions under (ii) above, a percentage of the applicable success fee will be paid to Credion. Financiers will be encouraged, but not required, to purchase monitoring services from us. The financier will pay us a monthly fee for such monitoring services. Entrepreneurs that are introduced to the platform by us will be charged a fee of €300 for a monitoring start package.
 
 The Agreement provides that commencing January 1, 2015 all financings facilitated and brokered by Credion and its advisors will be registered on our platform. In connection therewith, Credion will add us on a best efforts basis as a contractual party to all service level agreements it has signed and will sign. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Credion has the right to utilize other direct online funding platforms. Similarly, we have the right to facilitate financings brokered by other corporate finance companies, but we must continue to offer the Credion services within the financing process via our platform on a preferred supplier basis.
 
 As consideration for Credion’s obligations under the Agreement, we issued 1,500,000 shares of our restricted common stock to Credion following execution of the Agreement. For the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, we are required to issue up to an additional 1,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock to Credion, up to 250,000 of which shares are payable as at December 31, 2015 for the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, up to 500,000 of which shares are payable as at December 31, 2016 for the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and up to 250,000 of which shares are payable as at December 31, 2017 for the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The number of shares to be issued for each of 2015, 2016 and 2017 will be based upon the number of monitoring start packages of €300 times the number of companies purchasing those packages from us that have been introduced to us by Credion. During both 2015 and 2016 no monitoring start packages were sold to customers of Credion and no shares were payable as at December 31, 2016.
 
 SME entrepreneurs will be charged a success fee equal to 5% of the amount raised from the direct online funding platform, 20% of which will be payable to Credion. For private placements with SME entrepreneurs introduced by us, SME entrepreneurs will be charged a success fee of €250. If the entrepreneur has been introduced through the Credion network, no success fee will be charged on the private placement.
 
 As the result of our November 2016 corporate restructuring, we do not expect to realize any future revenues from this Agreement.
 
  Symbid Overview Corporate Structure
 
 Symbid B.V. derived until and including October 2016 income from its crowdfunding business in The Netherlands through revenue streams from Symbid Coöperatie U.A. (“Symbid Coöp”), a Dutch limited liability cooperative that licenses Symbid’s crowdfunding platform.  Symbid B.V. does not own or have any equity interest in Symbid Coöp. Symbid Coöp was a variable interest entity (“VIE”) which Symbid B.V. effectively controlled through corporate governance rather than through equity ownership.
 
 It was Symbid Coöp’s status as a VIE that allowed Symbid B.V. to consolidate the financial statements of Symbid Coöp as if Symbid Coöperatie U.A. were a subsidiary of Symbid B.V. As the result of our November 2016 corporate restructuring, we are no longer able to consolidate Symbid Coöp’s financial results with our own. As of December 31, 2016, Symbid B.V.’s fiscal year end, approximately 90% of Symbid B.V.’s revenues were derived from Symbid Coöp. As of December 31, 2015, Symbid B.V.’s fiscal year end, approximately 80% of Symbid B.V.’s revenues were derived from Symbid Coöp. Prior to November 1, 2016 we received administrative, success and management fees from Symbid Coöp. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these fees totaled: Administrative - $44,634, Success - $150,999 and Management - $0. For the year ended December 31, 2015, these fees totaled: Administrative - $62,632, Success - $219,523 and Management - $0.

 The intellectual property (“IP”) underlying Symbid B.V.’s crowdfunding platform is not owned by Symbid B.V.  It is owned by Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, a Dutch foundation that was formed in October 2013 to hold that property as part of Symbid’s restructuring.  In addition to the software IP relating to the crowdfunding platform technology, Stichting Symbid IP Foundation’s IP consists primarily of two internet domain names (www.symbid.com and www.symbid.nl) and does not include any patents. Stichting Symbid IP Foundation licensed the crowdfunding platform technology to Symbid Holding B.V. on a perpetual basis. Symbid Holding B.V., in turn, licenses the technology, on a perpetual basis, to Symbid B.V. Without the primary license of the crowdfunding platform technology from Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, Symbid would not be able to continue its business. By transferring the Symbid crowdfunding technology to Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, Symbid believes that it has insulated and protected that property from various types of claims that otherwise might possibly arise if the property had remained in a corporate entity.
 
 Our subsidiary, FAC B.V. is the owner of the perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we have developed a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for SME’s. Per addendum dated November 15, 2016 the license agreement had been amended to a non-exclusive license.
 
  History and Organizational Structure
 
 Symbid B.V. was incorporated on March 29, 2011, as a privately held besloten vennootschap (private limited liability company) organized under the laws of The Netherlands. Through October 3, 2013, Symbid B.V. was our primary operating company managing all of our activities including our crowdfunding platform in The Netherlands.  Until October 16, 2013, Symbid B.V. was the owner of our intellectual property (the “IP”).  This entity was also the contractor for all material agreements related to the IP. Additionally, Symbid B.V nominates for appointment, by the Symbid Foundation board, the board of directors of Symbid Foundation. Until March 2017, Symbid B.V. also held ownership interests in Equidam Holding B.V. (7%). Such interests were sold for €15,000.
 
 A schematic overview of our corporate structure as of March 1, 2017 is set forth below. In March 2017, we sold our 7% interest in Equidam Holding B.V.
 

 Neither Symbid Corp., Symbid Holding B.V., Symbid B.V. nor any of their affiliates have any ownership interests in Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, Symbid Foundation or Symbid Coöp.

  Reorganization of Corporate Structure in 2013
 
 Because of the December 6, 2013 Share Exchange and Symbid’s plans to enter various new markets, Symbid determined to restructure the legal organization of its business as described below.
 
 Symbid Holding B.V. was incorporated on October 3, 2013, as a privately held besloten vennootschap (private limited liability company) organized under the laws of The Netherlands.  Symbid Holding B.V. was organized to serve as the holding company for all of Symbid’s business activities in The Netherlands and in other countries. As such, on October 3, 2013, the holders of the capital shares of Symbid B.V. exchanged their shares for capital shares of Symbid Holding B.V. and, as a result, Symbid B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V. Symbid B.V. is now the Symbid operating entity for the Company’s business in The Netherlands. As such, Symbid B.V. will continue to hold the ownership interests in Equidam Holding B.V. FAC B.V. operates as of July 2014 as a 100% subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V. In conjunction with this reorganization, Symbid’s IP, which includes all of the software relating to the Symbid crowdfunding internet platform, was transferred to a new entity organized in The Netherlands on October 3, 2013, Stichting Symbid IP Foundation. We do not have an ownership interest in Stichting Symbid IP Foundation but maintain management control over Stichting Symbid IP Foundation through our control of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation’s board of directors. See “Risk Factors. Our intellectual property is owned by Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, a Dutch entity that we do not own”. Pursuant to the organizational documents of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, the board of directors of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation must be composed of at least two members, one of whom must always be Symbid B.V. or one of its directors and the other must always be Symbid Corp. or one of its directors. The size of the board of directors of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation is established by the board itself, giving Symbid B.V. and Symbid Corp. full control over the Stichting Symbid IP Foundation board.] Stichting Symbid IP Foundation has granted a perpetual license in the IP to Symbid Holding B.V. which, in turn, has granted a perpetual, license in the IP to Symbid B.V. Symbid B.V. previously sublicensed the IP to Symbid Coöp but in connection with the corporate restructure and the November 15, 2016 Intellectual Property License and Transfer Agreement, Symbid Stichting IP Foundation directly granted a perpetual, royalty free license to Symbid Corp. With respect to future Symbid crowdfunding platform business projects in other countries, Symbid Holding B.V. will grant IP licenses to the new legal entities established for these business purposes.
 
  Reorganization of Corporate Structure in 2016
 
 Because we were not able to raise additional capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 we were forced to enter into settlements with our creditors and note holders and restructure the Company. This restructuring caused us to curtail certain business operations and change our focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for the alternative financing in the SME market to the licensing of available software packages for which we own or license the intellectual property.
 
 The revised business model will require fewer employees, advisors and consultants and will be more economical to operate than our past operations. Over the past few years we have developed several software products suitable for the alternative market which we will continue to offer to and operate with third parties. Such products and related services include white label versions of crowdfunding software for investor groups and monitoring software to provide investors with ongoing insight into the performance of SMEs to which they have loaned money. Related licensing fees and subscription agreements may include set fees and yearly contribution fees.
 
 Our goal is to substantially reduce or eliminate our debt, continue to operate our business and negotiate a possible acquisition or other business combination with another operating entity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor or that if a business combination is consummated that it will be on favorable terms. In the interim, we will continue forward with our business operations under the revised business model.

 As the result of the restructuring, our previous crowdfunding platform in the Netherlands will be operated through Symbid Coöp. We previously controlled and operated Symbid Coöp through corporate governance but as the result of the restructuring, Symbid Coöp has become an independent entity. As we did not have the resources available to continue the software development of the online funding platform, Symbid Coöp was required to further develop the software for operating the crowdfunding platform under the laws and regulations of The Netherlands before January 1, 2017 in order to remain compliant, which it did. Symbid Coöp has, in return for reimbursing the further development of the software, been granted a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property from IP Foundation in order to continue crowdfunding operations in The Netherlands. We continue to hold an identical non-exclusive license to the intellectual property of the crowdfunding platform whereby we are allowed to use the most up to date versions of the software and other intellectual property.
 
  Market Need - The Problem Definition
 
 SMEs are crucial engines of economic growth, job creation and social cohesion. In many countries SMEs represent approximately 99% of all business entities. However, entrepreneurs and investors in the SME backbone of our economies experience obstacles and barriers when seeking to connect, fund and grow. Recent financial crises and stricter banking regulations are contributing to this vacuum in the life cycle of SME financing. Access to capital remains one of the biggest challenges in the creation, survival and growth of SMEs.
 
 In their report “Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs 2016”, which monitors SMEs’ and entrepreneurs’ access to finance in 37 countries over the period 2007-2014, with the pre-crisis year 2007 serving as a benchmark, The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development indicates that the ongoing economic recovery between 2012 and 2015 has had a moderately positive effect on SME financing. These improvements in the macroeconomic environment, which are expected to continue in the forthcoming years, as well as improved financial conditions led to a rise in lending volumes in the majority of participating countries. Despite these general positive developments, many small innovative businesses continue to face difficulties in accessing external financing. Credit conditions are expected to remain tight, regulatory requirements are likely to continue to discourage lending to SMEs, venture capital investments are generally still below pre-crisis levels and bank financing is often not suited to the needs of start-ups. The report consequently suggests that SMEs could further benefit from the ongoing recovery through tapping into a diverse range of financing instruments.
 
 Results from the 15th round of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) also confirm the above-described improvement in overall income situations of SMEs. In the period April – September 2016, Euro area enterprises reported overall improvements in their debt situations and declines in interest expenses. The SAFE survey additionally showed that SMEs in the euro area see access to finance as less of a burden compared to other business activities. In the Netherlands, where Symbid was incorporated in 2011, access to finance however remains the predominant problem according to the surveyed SMEs. Contrary to 3 years ago, the “external financing gap”, measuring the perceived difference at firm level between needed and available funds, records as a negative value for the third consecutive time. This indicates that SMEs in most Euro countries communicated that the potential supply of external funds topped the internal need for financing. The SAFE survey finally revealed that, although there is a slight increase, the use of equity as an external source of financing remains non relevant for many SMEs.
 
 However, according to a previous SAFE report, ‘innovative’ businesses active in the online industries have the poorest access to finance across the different types of business entities surveyed. This is due primarily to the difficulties associated with the valuation of companies that lack well-defined material assets but whose core business is based mostly upon intellectual property. Therefore, in our digital age, it is the more forward-thinking, online-oriented businesses that are suffering most from the lack of bank finance for SMEs.

 The lack of access to capital for SMEs, which was to a higher degree existent in the years after the financial crisis in 2007, was also recognized in the United States where the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was enacted into law in April 2012. The JOBS Act is intended to encourage the funding of small businesses located in the United States by easing various federal and state securities regulations. It is expected that once the SEC promulgates regulations required under the JOBS Act, entrepreneurs will be able to engage an online crowd of investors through equity crowdfunding. Title II went into effect on September 23, 2013. Title III rulings enabling the general solicitation of unaccredited investors, thereby effectively legalizing equity crowdfunding in the U.S. as is already the case in most European countries, went into effect on January 29, 2016.
 
 Although the above-mentioned research shows that financial markets and access to finance for SMEs have significantly improved over the past years, pre-financial crisis conditions are yet to be reached. In particular, innovative start-ups suffer from the tight credit conditions and increased regulatory requirements. It is also these companies for which traditional loans are not viable due to for example lacking revenue streams, leading to a demand for different forms of alternative financing.
 
  Online Funding Operations
 
 The launch of The Funding Network™ took place in early March 2015. Built around our investing and monitoring technology, The Funding Network™ gives entrepreneurs access to various types of finance, while offering (private and institutional) investors risk/reward transparency. Entrepreneurs connecting to our online funding platform are guided towards the type of funding best suited to their needs by our professional advisors. Investors can personalize their deal flow according to key business criteria, pinpointing the investment opportunities that matter to them. This is intended to produce a more efficient capital allocation service, underpinned by standardized XBRL data streamed from the financial reporting system. Our platform is designed to connect entrepreneurs, start-ups and small businesses to all types of funding.
 
 Our platform breaks down the funding process from beginning to end. We connect entrepreneurs to investors via sound financial advice. Investors seek new opportunities, then monitor the performance of their investments. Financial advisors give support to entrepreneurs along the way, while accountants provide the real-time financial data. The funding process consists of the following steps:
 
 
CREATE: The entrepreneur and advisor together create a funding request in a standardized deal format. SHARE: The standardized funding request can be shared with a variety of institutional investors, and a network of over 36,000 private (crowdfunding) investors, who can invest from as little as € 20 ($22). Deals can be shared publically (open) or privately (closed). MATCH: We match deals with the right investors based on personalized preferences and can facilitate the settlement if required. MONITOR: Ongoing financial analysis of private companies, resulting in reporting for optimal risk and return management. Financial data can be imported into our monitoring from the accountant reporting system. Standardized data allows for comparing the performance of companies. Investors and entrepreneurs both use a personalized dashboard based on pre-set Key Performance Indication (“KPI”) relating to a particular company.

  Symbid’s Product/Service Portfolio
 
  Crowdfunding
 
 As the result of our November 2016 corporate restructuring, we no longer offer crowdfunding services.
 
  Monitoring Services
 
 We offer our monitoring technology as part of The Funding Network™ and as a standalone product for business partners. The technology provides insights for investors and entrepreneurs with the periodical financial results of a portfolio of companies. The product is an online application fully integrated into The Funding Network™ by Symbid, handling XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) data in order to calculate KPIs and inform users of the key performance trends of a particular business. Entrepreneurs connecting to The Funding Network™ register to have their company’s data monitored and encourage their investors to subscribe to their company’s monitoring portal access. The product was conceived with its target user being an investor, but will also be marketed to entrepreneurs focused on assessing and improving the performance of their own business.
 
 A brief overview of service companies currently related to our crowdfunding eco-system is provided below.
 
 
FAC B.V. | On July 29, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., and FAC 2 B.V., a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired FAC B.V. (“Acquiree”), a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands from FAC 2 B.V. in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of our restricted common stock. Acquiree owns a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we intend to develop a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for SME’s, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands. The license provides the required technology for ongoing monitoring of private companies. Financial data can be imported into Symbid monitoring from the accountant reporting system resulting in powerful reporting for optimal risk and return management. Standardized data allows for comparing the performance of companies. Investors and entrepreneurs get a personal dashboard with KPI’s for key variables and covenants.

Equidam Holding B.V. | Equidam Holding B.V., founded in August 2013, is one of the first companies to be organized in any country as a crowdfunding service provider. Started as an online valuation tool for private companies with a particular focus on SMEs, Equidam Holding B.V. now also offers monitoring services to investors on the Symbid platform. In addition to Equidam Holding B.V.’s relationship with Symbid, this company has entered partnerships with European crowdfunding platforms to provide its services to these platforms as well. Symbid owned a 7% direct interest in Equidam Holding B.V. following an additional round of financing by Equidam Holding B.V. in which we determined not to participate. In March 2017, this 7% interest was sold for €15,000. 
Kredietpaspoort Coöperatie UA | The Kredietpaspoort (Credit Passport) is an online “passport” which provides up-to date information about entrepreneurs and their business. The product is designed to be used by private investors to quickly assess the prospects and reliability of start-ups, SMEs and their owners before making an investment. In essence, the Credit Passport is a simple-to-use yet comprehensive online tool which provides the necessary information for all lenders.

 Meanwhile, entrepreneurs gain insight into their funding potential with specific information about the types of investor attracted to their business and why they choose to invest or not. Furthermore, entrepreneurs are immersed in investment terminology and can learn how to target investors more effectively. The service enables investors and entrepreneurs to do business in a more efficient, streamlined fashion and reduces uncertainty for both sides.
 
 The Credit Passport complements The Funding Network by enabling entrepreneurs to create an online summary of critical investor information, thereby eliminating the costly paper trails which currently inhibit entrepreneurs in raising funds. We are currently a minority shareholder in the Kredietpaspoort initiative.
 
  The Market
 
 Driven by various factors, including the financial crisis, the ubiquity of mobile devices, increased transparency, significant decreases in the costs of computing powers as well as new regulatory law (JOBS Act), the alternative finance industry has grown exponentially over the past years. According to the report “The 2nd European Alternative Finance Industry Report” by The University of Cambridge and KPMG, in Europe, where the market for alternative finance has been growing at an impressive pace for several years, the total market volume for online alternative finance reached €5,431million in 2015. This represents an annual growth rate of 92%. The majority of the European market is comprised by the United Kingdom, which accounts for €4,348 million of the total alternative finance volume. The Netherlands represented the fourth largest market in alternative finance with a total market volume of €111 million. Furthermore, the per capita market volume in 2015 for the Netherlands was the highest in Europe (excl. the UK), amounting to €6.53.
 
 The report published by the University of Cambridge furthermore shows that in 2015, €536 million of business finance was raised through online alternative funding models, providing capital to a total of 9,442 SMEs (excluding the UK). This represents a year-on-year growth of 167% and 63% respectively.
 
 Currently Peer-to-Peer lending and reward-based crowdfunding account for 71% of the total European market volume (excl. UK). In 2015, equity-based crowdfunding comprised with €159 million, 16% of the market volume, and had an average three-year growth rate of 83%. In the Netherlands, the alternative finance volume through equity-based crowdfunding totaled €16,6 million.
 
 According to the University of Cambridge/KPMG report, a major trend within the alternative finance industry is the increased rates of participation rates of institutional investments. The percentage of institutional investors participating in online alternative finance platforms has grown from 33% in 2014 to 44% in 2015, and is expected to grow further in the coming years.
 
 In terms of risk perception, the survey conducted by the University of Cambridge pointed out that the Dutch rate “the collapse of one or more well-known platforms due to malpractice” as the highest crowdfunding risk. Fraud, increased business failure rates and changed to regulation were other risks considered by respondents.

 Affiliate and Group licenses – Symbid offers owners of existing communities or groups a crowdfunding service so they do not require their own crowdfunding infrastructure. Prices range from $530 to $2,500 on a yearly basis.


  The Competitive Environment
 
 The crowdfunding industry has developed rapidly since 2000 when several non-governmental organizations and companies started raisings funds online. The concept of online fundraising was quickly adapted to various forms of collective funding over the internet, now all being labelled as crowdfunding.
 
   
17


  
 
 There are several different forms of crowdfunding. The main categories are:
 
   ●
  Donation-based crowdfunding: donations made online to a specific project or cause without the prospect of any return;

 
   ●
  Pre-sales (reward-based) crowdfunding: donations made online to a specific project or cause with the prospect of a return in the form of a product or service, when the project is successful;

 
   ●
  Debt/loan crowdfunding (peer-to-peer and peer-to-business lending): investments made online in a specific loan proposal (business as well as private) with the prospect of a return in the form of interest and repayment of the initial debt;

 
   ●
  Equity crowdfunding: investments made online in specific investment proposals with the prospect of a return in the form of dividends and value growth.

 
 Globally, thousands of crowdfunding platforms are currently active in the marketplace. However, the majority of these platforms are involved in donation- or reward-based (pre-sales) crowdfunding. The low barriers to entry in this sector allow many vendors to establish crowdfunding platforms, but, typically, their scope is limited to a specific geography or nice industry, such as books or movies. According to the Massolution “Crowdfunding Industry 2015” report, the total global crowdfunding industry was estimated to be $34 billion, a 112% growth compared to 2014. This furthermore represents an enormous growth compared to 2012, where the global fundraising volume totaled only $2.7 billion.
 
 Many of the existing crowdfunding platforms struggle in this growth environment with respect to their ability to professionalize their systems and legal frameworks and otherwise manage their growth. Reward- and loan-based crowdfunding (e.g. peer-to-peer lending) currently account for approximately 90% of this industry, but equity crowdfunding is expected to further enlarge its market share in the short- to mid-term future. In 2015 $2.5 billion was fundraised through equity, whereas in 2012, the global equity crowdfunding market was worth just $116 million.
 
 Currently the UK has the largest equity crowdfunding market. The two leading UK platforms, Seedrs and Crowdcube, currently account for more than all other European platforms combined according to their own funding volume totals. To our knowledge, there are currently approximately 40 crowdfunding platforms active in The Netherlands. Due to regulatory changes there are at the moment no domestic platforms that offer all-equity deals on their platforms. There are however some foreign equity-crowdfunding platforms active in The Netherlands, including Seedrs and Ourcrowd.
 
 The 28 countries of the European Union are a very long way from offering a homogeneous regulatory environment for crowdfunding. This is particularly true of equity crowdfunding which touches on multiple heavily regulated areas of finance such as investment advice, securities trading, retail banking and corporate finance. Few European countries have, like France, issued new regulations that are specific to investment crowdfunding. In the Netherlands, as of April 1, 2016, the regulatory framework applicable to equity based crowdfunding was amended. Investment limits are doubled to €40,000 and platforms need to conduct an investors test in order to assess whether the investment is sound for this particular retail investor. Additionally, as of 2017 equity-based crowdfunding platforms are required to have an investment license. Due to these tightened regulations, we do not expect a significant increase in crowdfunding enterprises in the near future.

  Employees
 
 As of March 31, 2017 we had 2 employees involved through contractual relationships with the Company. Our contractual relationships with employees consist of employment agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 Description of Properties
 
 Our principal executive offices are located at Marconistraat 16, 3029 AK Rotterdam, The Netherlands. We are currently co-using this office space.
 
  Regulatory Framework
 
 During the development of the Symbid crowdfunding platform in 2010, we were in close contact with the Authority Financial Markets in The Netherlands (the “AFM”) to discuss the Symbid crowdfunding model, the structure of our crowdfunding platform and its relationship to the Dutch regulatory framework. In our correspondence with the AFM, we primarily focused on the equity based crowdfunding model rather than the pledge or donation based models which do not implicate securities law considerations. In an email correspondence to Symbid, the AFM acknowledged that, although it is Symbid’s responsibility to identify activities requiring government authorization, as described to the AFM by Symbid, the AFM saw, on the basis of the information provided, no indication that the crowdfunding activities of Symbid would require permission under the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision. Although we did not specifically address our partnering/affiliate programs in our correspondence with the AFM, it is our understanding and belief that the same AFM considerations would apply to these activities to the extent that they make use of Symbid’s legal structure and model. The activities of Symbid have not materially changed in comparison with the information provided to the AFM in 2010. During the expansion of our product offerings to include debt based crowdfunding, we have been in discussions with AFM regarding the classification of our activities. In agreement with the AFM, Symbid applied for an exemption for its activities under the Dutch financial regulatory framework at the AFM, which was provided in the second quarter of 2015. Additional changes in the regulatory framework are expected in the future whereby crowdfunding will become a regulated business, however as of November 2016 the Company is not offering any crowdfunding services in the Netherlands, or elsewhere.
 
 Symbid’s restructuring in 2013 in which it established Symbid Holding B.V. as a holding company for its crowdfunding activities and transferred its intellectual property to Stichting Symbid IP Foundation did not have an impact on Symbid’s legal structure at the operating level. Symbid established its operational model in The Netherlands such that all crowdfunding activities would be conducted at the Symbid Coöperatie U.A. level with management control exercised by Symbid Foundation. This operational structure was designed to function independently from the legal structure and changes in the ownership structure of Symbid B.V. or Symbid Holding B.V. Because of this operation versus ownership structure, Symbid believes that its corporate reorganization will have no impact on the application of the AFM’s considerations or other aspects of the Dutch regulatory framework.
 
 Our crowdfunding platform encompasses other activities which, in The Netherlands, could require a license or specific regulatory compliance under certain circumstances. These activities relate to (i) the holding of redeemable funds and (ii) securities offerings to the public without a prospectus.
 
  Redeemable funds – Our financial partner InterSolve (FEET EGI B.V.) holds a license from the Dutch Central Bank as an Electronic Money Institution, is supervised by the Authority Financial Markets (“AFM”), being the Dutch equivalent of the SEC, and the Dutch Central Bank and is, therefore, allowed to redeem funds to the public. On the Symbid crowdfunding platform, investors can re-claim, i.e., redeem, their electronic money at any time prior to the funding target having been reached of a business idea to which they have allocated their electronic money. InterSolve will exchange upon request by such an investor the amount of electronic money being redeemed into scriptural money on the bank account of the investor. Symbid partners with InterSolve to ensure that Symbid cannot be deemed to hold redeemable funds of investors itself. Because an investor’s funds are held in an electronic wallet with Intersolve and released to a particular project only when that project actually funds, and any funds that an investor allocates to a project that the investor redeems prior to a project funding remain in that investor’s account (electronic wallet) with Intersolve, which, in effect, acts as an escrow agent for the investor’s funds and particular project fundings, Symbid does not record any success fee revenues on its books until a project funding actually closes and Symbid’s earned fees are transferred to it. As a result of this structure, any funds that may be redeemed by an investor prior to a project funding and returned to that investor’s electronic wallet do not appear, and are not reported, on the financial statements of Symbid.  If, however, an investor decides to remove funds from his electronic wallet and return them to his personal bank account, effectively taking these funds out of the Symbid crowdfunding system, Symbid pays Intersolve a fee of approximately $16.50 (€15).

  Offerings to the public without a prospectus – Under Dutch law, as long as the target capital raised for a particular business over a period of 12 consecutive months remains below €2.5 million (approximately $2.75 million), there is an exemption from the prospectus delivery requirements. Under the current regulations, a prospectus must be prepared and approved by the AFM for capital raises planned or expected to exceed the €2.5 million (approximately $2.75 million) within a 12-month period.
 
 Separately, membership interests in a Dutch cooperative, if not freely tradable, are not considered securities under Dutch law. Symbid has taken the business decision to ensure that all membership interests in Symbid Coöperatie U.A. are not freely tradable; thus Symbid Coöperatie U.A. is not required to be licensed to sell securities under the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision.
 
  Legal Proceedings
 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business.
 
 We are currently not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject, nor are we aware of any such proceedings that are contemplated by any governmental authority.
