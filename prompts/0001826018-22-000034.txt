Item 1. Business.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to (a) the business of A Place for Rover, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the July 30, 2021 merger described below under “—Our History” or (b) Rover Group, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, after the consummation of that merger.
Our History
A Place for Rover, Inc., a Delaware corporation and, after the merger described below, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Legacy Rover”), was incorporated on June 16, 2011 and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, with offices in Spokane, Washington and internationally in Barcelona, Spain. In March 2017, we acquired DogVacay, Inc to accelerate our presence and growth in the United States and Canada. In October 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Barking Dog Ventures, Ltd. to accelerate our presence and expand our growth in Europe. 
Nebula Caravel Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, our legal predecessor company, and a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by True Wind Capital was incorporated in September 2020 and closed its initial public offering in December 2020 (“Caravel”). On July 30, 2021, Caravel consummated the previously announced merger (the “Merger”) with A Place for Rover, Inc. and Fetch Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Caravel (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into A Place for Rover, Inc., the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased, and A Place for Rover, Inc. continued as the surviving corporation in the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Caravel. The Merger was approved by Caravel’s stockholders at a meeting held on July 28, 2021. At the closing of the Merger on July 30, 2021, Caravel changed its name to Rover Group, Inc. 
On August 2, 2021, our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and public warrants, formerly those of Caravel, began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbols “ROVR” and “ROVRW,” respectively. We subsequently redeemed all of our outstanding public and private warrants in January 2022. In connection with the warrant redemption, the public warrants ceased trading on The Nasdaq Global Market effective as of the close of trading on January 12, 2022, and have been delisted. The warrant redemption had no effect on the trading of our Class A Common Stock, which continues to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “ROVR.” For more information on the warrant redemption, see Note 19 — Subsequent Events.
As a result of the Merger, we raised gross proceeds of $268.3 million, including:
•the contribution of $275.1 million of cash held in Caravel’s trust account from its initial public offering, net of the redemption of Caravel common stock held by Caravel’s public stockholders of $146.8 million; 
•$50.0 million private investment in public equity at $10.00 per share of our Class A Common Stock; 
•$80.0 million of additional gross proceeds from the Sponsor Backstop Subscription Agreement between Nebula Caravel Holdings, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Caravel pursuant to which True Wind Capital II, L.P. and True Wind Capital II-A, L.P. (together, the “TWC Funds”) purchased an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share; and 
•$10.0 million of additional gross proceeds from the sale of our Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement by and among Caravel, the TWC Funds, and BBCM Master Fund Ltd.

As a result of the Merger, we received net proceeds of $235.6 million, net of estimated transaction costs paid of $32.7 million. See Note 3 — Reverse Recapitalization for more information about the Merger.
Mission and Purpose
We believe that everyone deserves to experience the unconditional love of pets, and Rover exists to make that possible.
We started Rover to break down the barriers to loving and trusted pet care so more people could experience that unconditional love. As pet parents ourselves, we wanted to build a community where we could connect with pet care providers who would treat our pets like family. In developing the Rover platform, we also believed that if we could make it easy for everyday pet 
people to start and grow their own small pet care businesses, we could do more than enable additional income for care providers and loving care for pets; we could unlock joy for pets, pet lovers, and pet parents everywhere. Over the years, we have discovered more: Growing Rover has revealed to us the depth and importance of the bonds we share with our pets—and the extraordinary empathy, care, and love that people in our neighborhoods can provide for their communities. Some of the best parts of being on the Rover team are the stories and anecdotes that we hear about the unique bonds between pets, pet parents, and the pet care providers who love and care for them.
Take Ziggy, a Jindo mix whose owners were getting married. Like many contemporary pet parents, they wanted to incorporate their beloved Ziggy into the ceremony—so they turned to Rover. The care provider they met through Rover joined them at their wedding, not only keeping Ziggy out of trouble so he’d look sharp in his matching dog-suit, but going so far as to walk him down the aisle to greet his newly married parents.
Consider pet care provider Sylvia, who doesn’t just love dogs—she gets them. She asks her clients to pack a t-shirt that they’ve slept in as part of their dog’s overnight bag. The shirt smells like home, and it helps their dog feel safe and connected while they’re away.
In other words, the pet care providers on Rover are at the heart of our business. They’re ordinary neighborhood pet people who, when they step in to care for your pet, reveal themselves to be extraordinary. Our shared love of pets is powerful, inclusive, and magnetic. Pets bring people together and can even give us a sense of belonging and meaning. It’s our privilege to be stewards of those connections and relationships.
Overview
Rover is the world’s largest online marketplace for pet care based on gross booking value, or GBV. We connect pet parents with loving pet care providers who offer overnight services, including boarding and in-home pet sitting, as well as daytime services, including doggy daycare, dog walking, and drop-in visits. Through December 31, 2021, over three million unique pet parents and more than 660,000 pet care providers across North America, the United Kingdom and Western Europe have booked a service on Rover, enabling millions of moments of joy and play for people and pets. The user base of our platform extends across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and seven countries in Western Europe: Spain, France, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy, and Germany.
For pets and their parents, we started Rover to create a better pet care solution than the existing options of friends and family, neighbors and kennels. We built a marketplace where pet parents could match with pet people who wanted to earn extra income doing what they loved: spending time with pets. We believed that these matches not only enabled better care for pets, but also created joy for both parties, and we sought to radically simplify the logistics of pet care. We built a simple and easy-to-use platform that enables pet parents to discover, book, pay and review pet care providers online or in our app.
For pet care providers, we built tools to easily create a listing in the Rover marketplace along with simple tools for scheduling and booking care, communicating with pet parents, and receiving payment. To delight both parents and pet care providers, we invested in a customer service team to support them along the way. We went even further, with a foundational brand commitment to trust and safety. We developed features to facilitate safe, informed, and positive experiences for the people and pets in our community. We built a 24/7 in-house team to support our community if a problem arises during a stay and backed our marketplace with the Rover Guarantee to assist with certain out-of-pocket costs incurred by parents or pet care providers in the rare instance a service doesn’t go as planned. Safety has always been at the heart of what we do. Through it all, we have been guided by our love of pets and belief in the unique human-pet bond. 
Based on GBV, Rover is the category leader in the online marketplace for pet care today. Our scale drives ongoing improvements powered by network effects, as we can facilitate more and better matches between pet parents and pet care providers as more people join our platform. GBV on Rover was approximately 11x the size of the next closest online marketplace for pet care for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from approximately 7x for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on that marketplace’s publicly available gross booking data.
Scale in the market for pet care matters. Because each pet’s needs are unique, pet care providers—unlike service providers in many other marketplaces—are not interchangeable. Against that backdrop, our network of care providers enables us to facilitate the match between pet, parent, and provider to best meet the unique needs and preferences of all three. We had 250,000 active providers with a booking in 2021, and we believe our network represents the largest number of high-quality providers among online marketplaces for pet care. Moreover, we have carefully designed our technology and data algorithms to leverage our growing scale to help pet parents easily find the best matches. Our results speak for themselves—pet parents love Rover. From 
inception through December 31, 2021, pet parents had written more than 4.9 million reviews, and 97% of reviewed bookings had a 5-star rating. Pet parents who try Rover for the first time often become repeat customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 81% of our bookings were repeat bookings. In 2020 and 2019, approximately 86% and 84%, respectively, of our bookings were from repeat customers. 
The U.S. commercial market for non-medical pet services was $10.3 billion in 2019, according to Packaged Facts. But we believe the demand for high-quality, personalized pet care far exceeds the existing market. For example, based on surveys we conduct, typically 67% of the new pet parents on our marketplace were previously relying on friends, family, and neighbors, and had never used a commercial service for pet care. Based on the number of dogs and cats in the United States and estimates of travel and daytime care needs of pet parents, we estimate that our total addressable market for overnight and daytime services in the United States is approximately $79 billion.
We generate revenue from service fees charged to pet care providers and pet parents based on a percentage of the booking value on our marketplace. We also earn revenue from ancillary sources such as background checks, affiliate advertising deals, and the Rover Store. While the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our 2020 operating results, we saw increased operating results for 2021 as compared to 2019 due to the lifting of the most severe COVID-19 restrictions and increasing vaccine availability and uptake even as as travel and work from home trends remained below pre-pandemic levels. We believe that demand for the pet care services offered through our platform will continue to rebound as people increasingly return to normalized travel and work activity. Moreover, consumer behavior has continued to shift meaningfully toward online and app-based experiences. Based on the combination of these factors, we believe that our business will return to strong growth when the pandemic subsides. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
We are inspired to keep building our business to bring the love of pets to people everywhere, especially in the times when people need that companionship the most.
Pets and Their Love in People’s Lives
Pets offer people more than companionship; they fill lives with comfort, support, and belonging. In other words, they’re a steady force of unconditional love. So it follows that people are increasingly integrating them into their lifestyles, traditions and families.
Nearly nine out of ten households in the United States have or have had a pet. Sixty-seven percent of U.S. households currently have a pet, and another 20% previously owned a pet according to a 2020 National Pet Owners Survey report by the American Pet Products Association, or APPA. Generational trends in lifestyle contribute to this prevalence, with an increasing number of people choosing to bring a pet into their lives, likely driven, in part, by later average ages for marriage and children. Studies suggest that pets may decrease stress, improve heart health, and help children with their social and emotional skills, according to the U.S. National Institute of Health. In an era of social distancing during the pandemic, pet companionship and love has never been more important. A Packaged Facts survey from March 2020 indicated that 95% of dog owners and 94% of cat owners in the United States say that they “consider their dogs and cats to be part of the family.” This attitudinal trend is often called the “humanization of pets.” We serve a wide range of pet parents and household incomes, though our pet parents tend to be slightly younger and more affluent when compared to the age and income of the average pet owner based on a survey conducted by APPA.
How People Spend on Pets
This “humanization,” in addition to driving the growth in pet-owning households, has combined with “premiumization,” another widespread trend, to accelerate spending on pets within households. According to the results of an APPA survey, 32% of dog owners and 28% of cat owners would prioritize their pets’ medical needs over their own. Led by Millennials and Generation Z, many pet parents increasingly consider the needs of their pets not just equally important to those of the rest of the family, but more important. While pet ownership in the United States increased 2% annually on average from 2011 to 2018, overall spending on pets increased 7% annually on average over the same period according to Market Watch. From 2014 to 2019, according to Packaged Facts, annual spending per pet-owning household on non-medical pet services, which include boarding, sitting, walking, grooming, and training, grew 26% from $120 to $152 per year. Additionally, pet spend has been recession-resilient in the past. During the 2008-2009 recession, spending on pets increased 17%, compared to decreased spend in many other sectors, including entertainment, food, and housing, according to Market Watch.
Our Market Opportunity
Existing Commercial Market
The total U.S. market for pet spending was $95 billion in 2019, including pet food, veterinary services, pet supplies, and non-medical services, according to Packaged Facts. Due to impacts from COVID-19 and the related restrictions on travel and activities, Packaged Facts estimates a reduction in the market in 2020 to approximately $79 billion, Packaged Facts then estimates growth at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 9.2% through 2024 to reach approximately $111 billion.
Within this market, every category except for non-medical services is highly penetrated online, with relatively few category players. In contrast, the non-medical pet services category is highly fragmented and largely offline. This category includes overnight care, daytime services, and grooming, with overnight care comprising the largest portion of the category. The non-medical pet services market is estimated to have reached $10.3 billion in 2019, and is expected to be the fastest-growing segment of the pet industry from 2020 to 2024, with an estimated CAGR of 18.6% according to Packaged Facts.
Pet Services Market Opportunity
We believe the existing commercial market for pet care is limited because of the challenges of traditional pet care service offerings. Based on surveys we have conducted, typically 67% of new customers to Rover report that they have never purchased pet care before. Customers report that they have previously relied on friends, family, and neighbors for pet care services because of dissatisfaction with their commercial options. We believe that this latent demand represents an enormous expansion opportunity for the pet services industry as whole. We estimate the total addressable market in the United Stated today to be approximately $79 billion, including approximately $69 billion in overnight services and $10 billion in daytime services.
Overnight Services
The table below details our calculation of the overnight services opportunity in the United States. According to the APPA, 67% of U.S. households, or 85 million households, had pets in 2020. To estimate trip nights per household, we take the Euromonitor estimate of 1.4 billion overnight trips with 2.4 people per household in 2019, from which we get 2.5 nights per domestic trip and 5.0 nights per international trip, for 3.9 billion total trip nights, which we calculate to be 11.4 total trip nights per household. The result is 964 million total addressable nights.
There were 97 million dogs and 76 million cats in U.S. households as of 2020, according to APPA, for a total of 173 million pets, an average of 2.0 per pet household. Based on our average nightly rate of approximately $35 per pet, this results in a total overnight market opportunity of $68.8 billion. This is more than 20x the size of the current commercial market for overnight pet services. Over the next ten years, with the growth of travel nights based on Euromonitor estimates, and our estimate of the increase in pet households, we calculate that the market could grow to $100.2 billion.
Daytime Services
The table below details our calculation of the daytime services opportunity in the United States. There were 97 million dogs in pet households in 2020 according to APPA, and we estimate that figure can grow to 115 million over the next ten years. We estimate the number of services per year for dog grooming and walks and the percentage of pet households addressable for these services. Based on our historical average rate of $50 per groom and our average rate of $20 per walk, we estimate a total daytime market opportunity of $9.8 billion, with $5.8 billion from grooming services and $4.0 billion from walking services. This nearly $10 billion total addressable market is more than two times the size of the current commercial market for daytime pet services. Over the next ten years, with our estimate of the increase in pet households and addressable grooming households, we calculate that the market could grow to $13.4 billion per year. We believe opportunities in dog daycare and drop-in visits to be incremental to this market opportunity, as well as daytime service opportunities for cats.
In total, we estimate a $79 billion market opportunity today growing to $113 billion in the next ten years. Additionally, we estimate that this increases by approximately 30% when including the Canadian, United Kingdom, and Western European markets where we currently operate.
Overview of the Pet Services Market
Existing Options for Pet Parents
For the millions of pet parents with travel plans or busy schedules, existing care options are fraught with disadvantages, especially for parents who have concerns that their pet will not receive enough personalized and loving care.
•Family, Friends, and Neighbors. Most pet parents rely on short-term favors to care for their pets, but these arrangements can cause social guilt and require return favors. Pet parents choose friends, family, and neighbors so that their pet has a familiar experience. However, because the service is a favor, and not for pay, pet parents may feel unable to either specify or insist on particular levels of care. Friends, family, and neighbors often lack the experience to provide specialized care, and are not incentivized to provide reliable communication or deliver on specific pet care needs. Further, although these favors often occur with little or no direct cash transfer, once the costs of thank-you gifts and social capital are taken into account, many pet parents consider this approach to care to be anything but ‘free.’
•Local Independent Providers. Local mom and pop shops and independent professionals often operate at small scale with little to no online presence, primarily relying on word of mouth and marketing solutions such as flyers and local ads. As a pet parent, it is difficult to know where to find reliable information, who to call, and who to trust in the absence of consistent background checks, reviews, insurance, and other safeguards.
•Large Commercial Providers. Large commercial providers, such as kennels and daycares, cannot meet the individual needs of pet parents. First, they are often expensive. Second, many pets are not compatible with the crowded nature of large providers. Finally, pet parents may not feel comfortable with the quality of care their pets may receive from a commercial provider.
•Online Aggregators. Pet parents can also access general purpose online aggregators and directories, such as Craigslist, Nextdoor, or Yelp, to find pet care providers. However, pet parents may lack trust in these directories, or find it difficult to find an available and appropriate pet care provider. Providers they do find may not have verified reviews, have background checks, provide reliable updates, or provide other trust and safety features the pet parents desire.
What Pet Parents Want
We founded Rover because we believed a platform like ours could better address pet parents’ basic pet care needs—and that doing so represented an enormous business opportunity. As busy pet parents, we were ourselves familiar with the specific balance of quality, ease of use, and affordability that, if brought to market, could delight pet parents everywhere. In short, pet parents want:
•An environment where their pet feels happy and stress-free. Above all, pet parents care about how their pets feel when they are away. Pet parents want regular reassurance that their pets feel as comfortable, loved, and engaged as they would be at home. While some commercial providers try to address this need with innovations like pet webcams, pet parents often desire better confirmation that their pet is receiving loving care.
•Confidence and reassurance that their pets are receiving excellent, personalized care. Pet parents want the ability to carefully choose a provider and to confirm that their pets’ care is personalized to their unique needs and expectations. They also want to know that there are resources in place to effectively handle any problems that may arise while they are away from their pets.
•Technology-enabled ease of access and management. Pet parents expect to be able to use their mobile devices or computers to find available providers who will meet their pet’s needs. They want to effortlessly contact and communicate, book and pay for a service, and stay connected with both their pet and their pet care provider so they can feel confident their pet is being loved and is safe and happy in their absence.
•Care that suits their budget and their lifestyle. While many pet parents may find commercial solutions too expensive, they also live full lives and are willing to pay the right price for the right care. For other parents whose pets often have specific needs or requirements, cost is not a barrier in exchange for trusted and loving care.
Why Pet Parents Love Rover and Repeatedly Book
When a pet parent encounters Rover for the first time, they immediately know that we understand them. As pet parents new to Rover move through their first experience of browsing, booking, and managing care on our platform, our goal is to earn their trust and delight them by anticipating and addressing their unique needs. We aim to establish Rover as an extension of and improvement upon the pet care provided by friends and family: a loving, trustworthy, reliable option that becomes their go-to solution. Our success is reflected in the loyalty of our customers—for the year ended December 31, 2021, 81% of our bookings were repeat bookings.
•Personalized care for each unique pet. The first thing we present to pet parents is a wide variety of neighborhood pet care providers. Our platform empowers parents to choose providers based on availability, location, price, reviews, as well as more specialized options including type of home, access to yard, and the presence of children or other pets. Parents can find providers that will allow their pets on their furniture or will let them sleep on the bed. We also prompt pet parents to share details about their pets’ preferences, behavior, feeding habits, and lovable quirks to empower care providers to cater their care to each pet. We allow parents to recreate the familiar experience of loving care provided by friends, family and neighbors, but improve upon it by providing the tools to specify exact care standards, routines, communication, and environments so they can be confident their pet will thrive when they’re away.
•Care provider trust as a foundation. Pet parents see that providers on Rover share detailed profiles and personal information about themselves in order to build trust. Every provider has passed a third-party background check to offer peace of mind to pet parents. They include their names, pictures, and a description of their pet care experience and offerings, along with data on the number of repeat customers, verified customer reviews, and photos from previous stays. We also encourage pet care providers, pets, and pet parents to get to know each other before booking and mutually confirm that it’s a good match, through the use of “Meet & Greets.”
•Higher quality service at any price point. Pet parents find that pet care providers typically offer better quality service than traditional commercial offerings, at more affordable prices. For example, pet care providers on Rover’s platform 
charged an average cost per night per pet for boarding in the United States of approximately $40 in 2021, on the lower end of the national range of $29 to $80 per night at dog kennels in 2021 according to Homeguide.com. However, for pet parents seeking luxury experiences or specialized care for their pet, including pet massages, home-cooked food, or training, those services are available on Rover as well.
•Easy booking process. Pet parents have a simple and intuitive overall experience of finding, booking, and paying a pet care provider. Contacting a pet care provider through Rover us is as easy as a few keystrokes or taps on a phone, and most pet care providers respond in order to confirm the service within about three hours. Their personal and account information is secured, payments are cashless, and all credit card details are encrypted.
•Verifiability of quality and peace of mind. Once a booking is in process, pet parents typically receive pictures and videos of their pet through our app or online. To date, 140 million photos have been shared on our platform, or roughly an average of 5.6 photos per booking. Providers can also map their dog walks and share information with pet parents. In fact, providers reported 11.5 million pees and poops, and 2.4 million miles walked while caring for pets in 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2021, providers reported over 11.9 million pees and poops, and 3.0 million miles walked while caring for pets. Beyond the burst of joy that comes with seeing their pet’s smiling face while they’re away, this provides pet parents with peace of mind.
•Rover’s commitment to safety. Finally, pet parents see that trust and safety are at the heart of what we do. On top of our 24/7 support, we set clear community guidelines and provide features to facilitate safe, informed, and positive experiences for the people and pets in our community. In the rare instance that something goes wrong during a booking, the Rover Guarantee program covers members of our community up to a specified amount for costs arising from certain injuries or damages that occur during a service booked and paid through Rover. Our dedicated and in-house Trust & Safety team is equipped to offer steady, reliable, empathetic service to pet parents and pet care providers alike should any questions arise.
What Pet Care Providers Want
Our success is built on the foundation of passionate and dedicated pet care providers who have chosen to provide their services through Rover. Over the years, we have gotten to know the hundreds of thousands of care providers on the Rover platform, and understand what they want:
•Flexibility and empowerment. Pet care providers want to offer their services on their own terms. Some providers who use Rover have a separate job, are retired, or work at home and are looking for a “side hustle,” while others are looking to build a pet care business that can grow and scale to a full-time commitment. Our pet care providers tend to be younger when compared to the average pet owner based on a survey conducted by APPA.
•The love of pets in their lives. Pet care providers are driven by a shared love of pets. Passion for the playful energy and sweet companionship of a pet is a prerequisite. As one pet care provider shared in a November 2020 survey, they offer their services on Rover “to experience having a pet because I don’t have time for one—and for the extra money.” It’s a common refrain among our provider community: offering pet care is more than a way to make money. We are consistently struck by their passion for pets and providing excellent care.
•Meaningful earnings that suit their schedules. Some pet care providers seek to make thousands of dollars per year, while others are satisfied with a few stays per year. Whatever level they choose, satisfaction in providing care is directly tied to their ability to maximize time with pets, and minimize time on logistics, marketing, and other administrative duties. Our platform offers tipping and daily pricing services to help our care providers increase their earnings potential.
Why Pet Care Providers are Attracted to Rover and Stay on Our Platform
Similar to pet parents, when prospective pet care providers encounter Rover for the first time, we aim to anticipate and address many of their needs in advance in a way that they notice immediately. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 68% of our bookings were with pet care providers who had received bookings on our platform in 2020, as we saw an influx of new providers join our platform and receive bookings in 2021.
•Easy access to nearby demand from pet parents. The first thing that we want prospective providers to notice is that other providers in their neighborhoods have amassed dozens, if not hundreds, of reviews and repeat bookings. By 
browsing the profiles, reading the provider reviews, and observing stay photos, they can quickly get a sense for the experience of offering services through Rover. And by observing the clear, straightforward profiles of the most successful providers in their areas, potential pet care providers can easily appreciate the effort that is required to establish a presence on the platform.
•Simple listing setup with an emphasis on trust. Pet care providers who establish a presence on Rover discover that, while the process itself is straightforward, it’s in everyone’s best interest for them to build trust and transparency with pet parents. Specifically, pet care providers are required to pass a background check in the United States and Canada or identity verification in the United Kingdom and Europe, and disclose pertinent details about themselves and their residences that are reviewed by Rover specialists. They are encouraged to reach out to members of their community for testimonials about their trustworthiness and experience in pet care that are then made available to pet parents. These measures reassure pet care providers that they are joining a platform that will represent them as trustworthy and reliable.
•Flexible, straightforward booking management tools. Our platform offers tools that allow pet care providers to manage bookings, retain information about the pet parents and pets they have booked, and safely communicate (including through their anonymized Rover number) to share photos, videos, and GPS mapping. They can receive secure and convenient online payments, including tips, set their availability with our calendar feature, and only book care that’s a fit for their preferences and schedule—and they can do all this through a single app or via the Rover website.
•24/7 support, for problems big and small. If something goes wrong during a booking, pet care providers have the support of our customer service and Trust & Safety teams as well as the Rover pet care community in helping to resolve issues. For example, Rover customer service can connect pet care providers to a third-party veterinary telemedicine service to help them assess the situation if a pet under their care becomes ill. Further, the Rover Guarantee program provides peace of mind for pet care providers as well as pet parents.
Our Marketplace Creation Strategy
To create this new market for pet services, which requires both local network effects and platform network effects, we have developed a local marketplace and brand strategy. In particular, by providing excellent customer satisfaction, with 97% 5-star reviews, we drive word of mouth growth in a local marketplace. This drives our brand in combination with efforts such as content marketing and our leading blog for pet lovers.
•New pet parents and pet care providers join Rover organically. Pet parents and pet care providers from neighborhoods covering 96% of the United States population have signed up with Rover. In the year ended December 31, 2021, 43% of new pet parents came to us through word-of-mouth—50% in our largest U.S. markets. We also complement word-of-mouth momentum with content to drive awareness of Rover with more pet lovers. We created The Dog People, our blog, in 2014, and have scaled it to nearly seven million monthly unique visitors as of December 31, 2021, one of the largest pet blogs in the world.
•Our matching algorithm increases customer satisfaction, growing the marketplace. Unlike marketplaces that invest primarily in acquisition marketing to create a flywheel of growing demand and supply, Rover’s matching algorithm is the key to our marketplace creation strategy. Facilitating great matches between pet, parent, and provider is the most important thing we do. Rover engineers, data scientists, and statisticians develop, maintain, and update our algorithms. We use reviews, proximity, browsing, contact, and booking data to predict which pet care providers are most likely to be great matches when pet parents search for providers in our marketplace. The stages of our matching algorithm are:
◦More bookings lead to more data. With more bookings we increase the density and diversity of our marketplace, adding to our data science asset and improving our ability to facilitate better matches through machine learning.
◦More data leads to better matches. As activity on our platform grows, we build better data density in a geography over time. More density leads to better matches. As the density of providers increases in a given geography the likelihood of finding the best provider in close proximity to match the nuanced needs of our pet parents increases. We monitor over a hundred attributes of a booking, including proximity, response time, and likelihood to rebook.
◦Better matches lead to more bookings. Our proprietary Rover algorithm learns to present pet care providers who are most likely to match for a booking, and who have quick response times, increasing the likelihood that a search turns into a booking.
•Repeat bookings increase, driving brand awareness and word of mouth attraction of more pet parents and pet care providers. As pets and parents have better experiences on Rover, they are increasingly more likely to rebook services. Increases in loyalty from pet parents also increases word of mouth marketing to other pet parents, who then join the platform. These pet parents in turn create even more information that Rover can use to make the experiences of other pets, parents, and pet care providers even better in the future, creating a virtuous cycle. Our brand sits at the nexus of trust and love, and our brand strategy is to earn our place in pet parents’ “circle of trust” for pet care. We do this by establishing Rover as an extension and improvement upon pet care provided by friends and family: a loving, trustworthy, reliable option that becomes the go-to solution.
In these ways, improvements in our matching algorithm have compounding, accelerating effects on the ability of our marketplace to scale, and to leverage our scale into faster scaling, as seen in the figure below.
We complement our organic growth with paid customer acquisition. Our algorithm improves paid marketing efficiency as a local marketplace grows. Once our matching algorithms have enough data to increase our conversion rate and rebooking rate in a market, we accelerate investment in paid customer acquisition. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 46% of new bookings came from paid channels, while in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 38% of new bookings came from paid channels. We use predictive analytics to invest in marketing and target a one to two quarter payback period, inclusive of variable costs. Because of our matching algorithm, we can acquire customers more efficiently than competing platforms with lower conversion rates.
Competitive Strengths
As we grow our online pet care marketplace, our competitive strengths relative to other online platforms include:
•Largest number of high-quality pet care providers. Pet care providers are attracted to the Rover platform. As pet parents conduct more transactions on the platform, they create additional bookings for pet care providers. Additional bookings enable care providers to make more money and to manage their listings so that the matches they receive are even more targeted to their own preferences without sacrificing earnings. For example, a pet care provider who desires to book only with Havanese dogs may find herself able to do that over time as she amasses sufficient reviews and repeat customers, and as the Havanese bookings increase. This ability to precisely satisfy the unique preferences of pet care providers is very difficult to replicate and translates to enormous provider satisfaction and advocacy. Pet care 
providers come to our platform organically and stay with it. For example, we find that 70% of our providers receive three or more bookings in their first 12 months on the platform. For those in this group, when comparing year 2 revenue to year 1 repeat revenue, providers experience above 90% revenue retention. In subsequent years, we see revenue retention increase.
•Rover algorithm and data scale to make better matches. The scale and breadth of Rover’s pet care provider network, coupled with the evolution of our algorithm, enables us to continuously improve matches on our platform. Instead of just investing in marketing to grow our marketplace, we have focused on matching the needs and preferences of each individual pet parent to the best pet care provider. As a result, pet parents who were first-time users of Rover during the three months ended December 31, 2021 were over two times more likely to find and book with a pet care provider than first-time users in 2012.
•Multiple network effects. According to publicly available gross booking data, we are the leading marketplace for pet services in the United States, Canada and Europe; GBV on Rover was approximately 11x the size of the next closest online marketplace for pet care for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from approximately 7x for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on that marketplace’s publicly available gross booking data. With our leading scale, we can offer pet parents and pet care providers the benefits of density and diversity in a local marketplace. Pet parents searching for care on Rover can often find providers who live in their neighborhoods, or even—in the case of people in large cities—in their own apartment buildings. They can also find pet care providers who have both a broad diversity of environment, offerings, availability, capabilities, and price points to meet the unique needs of their pets. Many of these providers will also have dozens, if not hundreds, of reviews and repeat customers. This combination of density, diversity, and quality results in better matches and more positive experiences on our marketplace.
•Strong pet parent loyalty and word-of-mouth growth. In 2021, 1.3 million unique pet parents had a booking on our platform. We define pet parent cohorts by the month/period in which pet parents first booked on our platform. Of our January 2021 cohort, 63% of new pet parents on Rover rebooked within the first 12 months. Our continuous excellence in facilitating initial matches between pet, parent, and provider translates directly into advantages in our ability to retain pet parents and match them with providers who offer other types of services as well. For example, a new pet parent who books a drop-in visit as a first service on Rover may translate her delight into trials of doggy day care, or dog walking. The number of bookings per repeat customer has grown from 3.7 in year 1 for our January 2013 cohort, to 7.3 in year 1 for our January 2021 cohort.
•Top Tier trust and safety support designed for pet care. Our platform provides trust and safety support to both pet parents and providers by carefully selecting the trust and safety agents that assist parents and providers with everything from emergency vet visits to questions about pet behavior. Rover has spent the last eight years evolving the practice of supporting parents and providers via phone and email.
Growth Strategies
We aim to build a global brand that stands for excellence in pet care through the pursuit of the following strategies. These individual vectors accelerate each other by driving the entire marketplace with additional cross-sell opportunities and brand and data synergies.
•Attract and delight customers in existing geographies and within existing services. We believe that considerable growth remains within our existing service offerings and geographies. Our cumulative customer volumes represent a tiny fraction of this potential. From inception through December 31, 2021, over three million unique pet parents had booked a service on Rover, which represents approximately 2.5% of the estimated 125 million pet households in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. By continuing to enhance our platform, we make it fast and easy to find a trusted pet care provider in your neighborhood.
•Expand service offerings and pets covered. We plan to introduce additional service offerings in the Rover marketplace, further delighting pets, parents, and providers and driving significant revenue growth. For example, in late 2015 we introduced dog walking, drop-in visits, and doggy day care as complements to dog boarding and house sitting. In the year ended December 31, 2021, those services had expanded to 31% of total GBV. 
We launched Rover with pet services for dogs and found that pet lovers use Rover to arrange care for animals of all types. In 2018, we modified our applications to better support cats on the platform. Over time we expect to enhance 
our cat offering and expand offerings to more types of pets. We will continue to add offerings to delight pet care providers and pet parents.
•Increase international coverage. We aim to serve pet parents and pet care providers around the world. In the near term, our focus is to complete our European footprint. While we believe that our current footprint represents the most opportunity in Western Europe, we also believe that Belgium, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, and Poland are attractive markets that could offer meaningful expansion to our existing European opportunity. We plan to expand organically, and continue to evaluate acquisitions to supplement our organic growth and operating leverage. Over the longer term, we may expand into additional attractive geographies.
•Grow advertising and retail offerings. We plan to leverage our brand to expand revenue from non-service offerings. We offer The Dog People blog and Rover Store to make life easier and more joyful for pet parents and pet care providers. As part of our publishing platform, Rover pet care experts and writers craft customer-centric product reviews, recommendations, and information, which have become a trusted source on all things pet-related. Over time, we entered into affiliate relationships with select retail partners to monetize our content operation. Our second initiative to leverage our brand to make life easier for pet parents is the Rover Store, which offers products that strengthen bonds between people and the pets in their lives. The Rover Store celebrates unique human-pet relationships with curated and high-quality third-party merchandise alongside bespoke Rover-branded merchandise and materials for care providers to grow their pet care businesses on Rover.
•Expand strategic partnerships. We believe that, over time, we can extend the value of Rover with strategic partnerships in the pet industry and others, including travel, hospitality, and omni-channel retail. We anticipate that many of these partnerships will be structured as affiliate relationships in which the partner introduces Rover to their customer base, and in turn receives a referral commission for completed bookings. These mutually beneficial partnerships can enable efficient growth by connecting Rover to new audiences of highly-qualified prospective customers: pet parents interested in travel, leading busy lives, and actively shopping for products they and their pets will love. By introducing Rover to these audiences through brands such audiences know and trust, we can target our awareness-building efforts and connect more pet parents with quality, local pet care providers.
Our Services
The figure below describes the services offered on our marketplace, with GBV and average price based on 2021 results. To find a pet care provider, following contact on our app, pet parents often arrange a Meet and Greet with the pet care provider. Once the service begins, pet parents can receive regular photos and updates from the pet care provider. Following the service, pet parents can review the pet care providers. Often, new pet parents come to our platform ahead of a planned trip, and once they experience Rover, they expand to daytime services as well. We introduced recurring bookings for daytime services in 2019 to allow pet parents and pet care providers to set a regular schedule for their services.
A Foundation of Trust and Safety
Rover was founded in reverence for the unique bond between each pet and parent, so no pet, parent, care provider, or safety incident is a mere statistic. Building safety into every booking is foundational at Rover, and we are committed to promoting safe stays. In the rare instance something doesn’t go as planned, we’ve built an experienced team to assist pet parents and care providers alike. We have built safety features into our platform which we believe, taken together, are unparalleled in comparison to other pet care options. This is made possible by a number of investments we have made to bring peace of mind to pet parents.
•Watchlist and background checks. All new pet care providers on our platform in the United States and Canada pass third-party background checks in order to offer their services on Rover. In the United States, pet care providers are checked against national criminal offense databases, sex offender registries, and certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watchlists, and we’ve also moved to enhanced background checks, which is more comprehensive and includes county level verification. In the United Kingdom and Europe, we use a third-party to conduct an identity verification on all pet care providers. All pet care provider profiles are also subject to review and approval by our team of pet care provider specialists.
•Community standards. We move quickly to correct behaviors that are not consistent with our community guidelines. We regularly remove both pet parents and pet care providers from our platform if they behave in ways that violate our community guidelines. In doing so, we aim to preserve the integrity of our platform and keep Rover safe for pets, parents, and providers.
•Detailed pet care provider profile. All pet care providers on our platform provide a detailed profile and personal information such as name, profile picture, personal address, and pet care experience, among other information. This information, along with data on the number of repeat customers and verified customer reviews, provides additional trust for pet parents.
•Personal information privacy. Pet parents and pet care providers can meet and communicate through the Rover platform without sharing their personal information with each other until they schedule a booking or decide to share personal information via Rover messaging.
•Customer reviews. After a booking is complete, pet care providers can write reviews of the pets and respond publicly to the pet parents’ review of themselves. From inception through December 31, 2021, our pet parents and pet care providers had written more than 4.9 million cumulative reviews, and 97% of our reviewed bookings had a 5-star rating.
•Support. As a commitment to quality experience and peace of mind for our pet care providers and parents, our support line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week in the United States and Canada, 9:00 am to 6:00 pm in the United Kingdom, and 10:00 am to 7:00 pm in Europe. Pet care providers also have access to advice from qualified veterinary professionals in case of emergencies. In the unfortunate event that a pet care provider needs to cancel at the last minute, our Reservation Protection means our customer service team will help the pet parent find someone new on the Rover platform who’ll offer great care for their pet.
Our People and Culture
Amazing people come to work at Rover because they hear about our culture. Our leadership team is committed to building and sustaining a culture that challenges people to be the best contributors to the business that they can be, but also welcomes and values them as human beings with everyday struggles that show up in the workplace. As a result, we have built a team of results-oriented and data-first professionals who are also collegial, personable, and genuinely nice to be around.
Our approach for building culture is explicit. “Culture” can be defined as “the quality in a person or society that arises from a concern for what is regarded as excellent.” We subscribe strongly to this idea and, as a company, have established those ideas that are excellent in the form of our company values. These values are not simply words on paper; they are statements that we take seriously and that we reinforce regularly during our interview process, in our employee review and development process, in our consideration of internal promotions, and in regular company presentations. These values are tied directly to specific, unique-to-Rover behaviors that we encourage, and others that we do not. They are worth stating here in their entirety:
•Commitment to our community. We do our very best, every day, to serve the needs of pet care providers, parents, and their pets, so they feel a part of our community. Their safety and well-being are top priority.
•No office politics. We lean into the hard stuff, own our decisions, and prioritize business goals over short-term career interests. We have respect for transparency and reverence for vulnerability, and we tell it how it is—including about ourselves.
•Intentional balance of pace and precision. We rely on data and analysis to drive decisions, and we’re deliberate about balancing speed with the risk of error. And when it’s time to go fast, we move. We’re not intimidated by failure, accepting occasional errors of action as evidence of momentum.
•Focus on impact. We don’t waste time and we don’t waste money. We value results, not just insights or effort.
•Discipline in the way we debate. We get the right people involved in key conversations. When we spot a problem, we propose a solution. We believe that the best business outcomes come from a diverse set of perspectives. And when the decision parent makes a call, we lock arms to support its success.
•Devotion to each other as people. We’re driven by seeing our people succeed and grow. Families and life events come first, and we make space for fun and celebration. We’re committed to building a culture of inclusivity and diversity and ensuring everyone contributes to their fullest potential.
•Relentless pursuit of inspiring outcomes. We’re determined to do our jobs better than they’ve ever been done, and we inspire each other by pushing past our own perceived limitations—with the full knowledge that doing so will be uncomfortable.
Development and Technology Infrastructure
Our technology vision is to build and deliver secure, flexible, scalable systems, tools, and products that exceed our customers’ expectations, accelerate growth, and improve productivity. Our guiding principle is to aim for a technology architecture that is modularized along natural domain boundaries emerging from how our business works.
We built our marketplace to constantly improve in its ability to match unique pets with unique pet care providers as the business scaled. Our proprietary core booking funnel platform connects to the frontend customer web and mobile clients, as well as to our support operations team and our data science platform. We collect and secure information generated from customer activity and use machine learning to continuously improve our matching algorithm. We have a common platform that allows us to seamlessly internationalize our product, integrate images and videos, use experiments to optimize customer experience and test product improvements in real time, monitor our site reliability, and rapidly respond to incidents. Finally, our 
core booking funnel platform connects to leading third party vendors for communications, payment processing, IT operations management, as well as background checks.
We have a research and development culture that rapidly and consistently delivers high-quality products and enhancements to the performance, functionality, and usability of our platform. As of December 31, 2021, we have assembled a team of 119 highly skilled technical leaders, engineers, designers, and computer and data scientists whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas. We organize our team with product development, platform engineering, data engineering and analytics, cloud engineering solutions, and information security. We focus on customer experience, quality, consistency, reliability, and efficiency when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and operating system-agnostic. We follow agile methodology, frequently update our software products and have a regular software release schedule. Our products and systems are built on secure and scalable technology platforms and services that enable us to deliver customer-centric products and services on infrastructures that manage peaks in demand.
We have a commercial agreement with AWS for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of this relationship, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. See “Risk Factors—We primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.”
We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Full disk snapshots of the database are performed daily, and databases can be restored to any point in time within the retention period using our database services’ point-in-time recovery features. In addition, as a default, redundant copies of content are stored independently in at least two separate geographic regions and replicated reliably within each region. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy, data protection, and security foundations and continually implement, review, and update our related policies and practices.
Operations and Support
Our operations and support team assists pet parents and pet service providers with items such as changes to existing bookings, questions concerning completion of a booking, addressing safety issues such as illness or other complications, and the initial quality review of pet service provider profiles. We are proud of our success in providing excellent support to both pet parents and providers. In the United States and Canada, our support team offers 24/7 assistance in both French and English. We rely on a network of third-party partners to handle most of our customer service-related inbound requests, while more sensitive issues are handled by our employee teams located in Seattle and Spokane.
In Europe, all of our service-related contacts, both voice and email, are handled by employees located in Barcelona. These agents are trained to handle both routine and escalated contacts. We offer local language support for all the countries in which we operate, with the hours of operation for this support varying by language.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy primarily consists of acquisition marketing, brand marketing, and our blog, The Dog People.
We manage our digital demand acquisition marketing at a local level. In the earlier stages of maturity within a specific geography, we use acquisition marketing to complement organic growth and increase information for our algorithm. As a specific geographic marketplace matures, we see the proportion of new bookings driven by word-of-mouth increase. Once a marketplace is more mature, we accelerate acquisition marketing with a faster payback period and higher expected lifetime value for a new pet parent. Marketing spend, inclusive of headcount, represented 18% of GBV in 2018, 11% in 2019, 7% in 2020, and 4% in 2021 for the years ended December 31.
In response to the COVD-19 pandemic, we modified our approach to marketing in light of the depressed demand and increasing cancellation rates. As travel restrictions eased and market conditions began to improve in 2021, we increased our paid marketing acquisition, and as a result drove strong new customer bookings for the year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we saw depressed demand due to the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19, which adversely impacted marketing efficiency for those periods. For additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of COVID-19.”
Our brand marketing strategy consists primarily of word of mouth, social media, our The Dog People blog, public relations, and up-funnel media buys that fit within our marketing payback guidelines. Our brand strategy is to earn a place in pet parents’ “circle of trust” for pet care. We do this by establishing Rover as an extension of, and improvement upon, the pet care provided by friends and family: a loving, trustworthy, reliable option that becomes the go-to solution.
We created The Dog People blog in 2014 and have scaled it to nearly seven million monthly unique visitors in 2021, making it one of the largest pet blogs in the world. In addition to driving awareness of Rover to prospective customers, The Dog People helps us to constantly reinforce our brand with pet parents and pet care providers who are currently on the platform. Historically, our content has focused on helpful, instructional articles designed to make it easier for people to have pets in their lives and spotlighting relevant stories that celebrate the joy of pets.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 372 employees worldwide, including 119 in product development, 35 in marketing, 148 in operations and support, and 70 in general and administrative. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
When not working from home due to a global health pandemic, our employees work in a collaborative, fun, and engaging environment with our four-legged friends in our Seattle headquarters, as well as our regional offices in Barcelona and Spokane. We’ve recently commenced hiring for a possible second operations center in San Antonio, Texas.
Because of the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees in the first half of 2020. For impacted employees, in addition to severance, we extended health benefits for six months and offered a longer exercise window for stock options. To support our teams during that difficult time, our management team focused on being intentional about how we communicate, providing context for our decisions, and acknowledging the ongoing human impact of the pandemic and the reduction in force to our employees.
Competition
Our customers consist of pet parents and pet care providers, and we compete to attract and retain both pet parents and pet care providers on the basis of brand appeal, commitment to safety, customer service, and the usefulness and convenience of our platform. We also compete, with respect to pet parents, on quality, affordability and variety of offerings, and, with respect to pet service providers, on the ability to generate income.
The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented. We face multiple competitors across different categories, and our competitors vary in both size and breadth of services. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages, as well as new entrants into the market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. Our main competitors include:
•Friends, family, and neighbors. Our largest competitive dynamic remains the people to whom pet parents go for pet care within their personal networks.
•Local independent operators. Local mom and pop shops and independent professionals often operate at small scale with little to no online presence, primarily relying on word of mouth and marketing solutions such as flyers and local ads. As a pet parent, it is difficult to know where to find reliable information, who to call, and who to trust.
•Large commercial providers. Large commercial providers, such as kennels and daycares, often struggle to meet the individual needs of pet parents and their pets. Such providers can be expensive, and their facilities are often crowded, inducing stress in some pets and leading pet parents to question the quality of care their pets receive.
•Online aggregators and directories. Pet parents can also access general purpose online aggregators and directories, such as Craigslist, Nextdoor, or Yelp, to find pet care providers. However, pet parents may lack trust in these directories, or find it difficult to find an available and appropriate pet care provider.
•Other digital marketplaces. We compete with services such as Wag, the next largest online marketplace for pet care, and the pet care offering on Care.com in the United States, and small operators such as Gudog in Europe and Pawshake in Europe and Canada. We differentiate ourselves with our pure play and scaled offering.
We believe that we compete effectively against each of these competitors given our scale, brand, trust, service, convenience, data, quality of care, and affordability, and ability of care providers to generate income.
Seasonality
Our bookings are impacted by seasonal trends. We typically experience stronger bookings during the months of June, July, and August, and November and December, which in a typical year coincides with high travel demand related to summer vacation and holiday travel. This seasonality impacts bookings, GBV, revenue, marketing and service operations expenses. Bookings can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property, assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our key brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2021, we held nine registered trademarks in the United States and 19 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.rover.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
Data Privacy, Data Protection and Security
We are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of our customers and our employees, and as such, we place an emphasis on data privacy, data protection and security. Our privacy and information security program is designed and implemented, both within our internal systems and on our platform, in an effort to address the security and compliance requirements of personal or otherwise sensitive or confidential data related to pet parents, pet service providers, and our employees.
We have a dedicated team of professionals that focuses on technical measures such as application, network, and system security, as well as policy measures related to privacy compliance, internal training and education, and documented incident response protocols. We maintain a documented information security program that includes periodic scans designed to identify security vulnerabilities on our servers, workstations, network equipment, production environment, and applications, and provides for subsequent remediation of any discovered vulnerabilities according to severity. We also conduct regular penetration tests and remediate according to severity for any vulnerabilities found.
We encrypt sensitive and proprietary information, as well as the personal information of our customers and our employees, both in transit (using secure transport layer security cryptographic protocols) and at rest. We use multi-factor authentication, permissioning software, audit logs, and other security controls to control access to internal systems that contain personal or other confidential information.
We design and implement our platform, offerings, and policies with a goal of facilitating compliance with evolving privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations and demonstrate respect for the privacy and data protection rights of our customers and employees. We publish our customer-related privacy practices on our website, and we maintain certain additional internal policies and practices relating to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information. We maintain a process for responding to requests made by law enforcement or government authorities for the personal information of our customers, and in connection with that process, we generally require a subpoena, court order or similar legal process prior to providing such personal information.
Publication of our privacy statement and other policies and notices regarding privacy, data protection and data security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if those statements, notices or policies are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection, or data security. 
The laws and regulations to which we are subject relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, are evolving and we expect them to continue to change over time. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires covered companies to provide specified disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. Additionally, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or CPRA. The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. Guidance related to the CCPA and CPRA continues to evolve. In addition, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or VCDPA, which will take effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act, passed on June 8, 2021, will take effect on July 1, 2023. Both laws emulate the CCPA and the CPRA in many respects, but each law includes its own unique compliance requirements. Other privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we may be subject include, for example, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the EU ePrivacy Directive, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 
More generally, the various legal obligations that apply to us relating to privacy and data security may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our mobile applications or website. We may need to take additional measures to comply with new and evolving legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to reduce information security incidents or avoid breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data. See “Risk Factors—Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, and standards in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, pricing, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, animal and human health and safety, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, product liability, environmental protection, taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, e-commerce, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. These laws, regulations, and standards are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity or unclear applicability, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to comply with these laws or regulations in a cost-effective manner, we may need to modify impacted services and our platform, which could require a substantial investment and loss of revenue, or cease providing the impacted service altogether. If we are found to have violated laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties, and other losses.
National, state and local governmental authorities have enacted or pursued, and may in the future enact and pursue, measures designed to regulate the “gig economy.” For example, in 2019, the California Assembly passed AB-5, codifying a narrow worker classification test known as the “ABC test,” which has had the effect of treating many “gig economy” workers as employees. AB-5 includes a referral agency exemption that specifically applies to animal services and dog walking and grooming. We believe that pet care providers who use the Rover platform either satisfy the ABC test, fall within the referral agency exemption, or both. 
In addition, other jurisdictions could adopt similar laws that do not include such carve outs and which, if applied to Rover’s platform, could adversely impact its availability in those jurisdictions and our business. See “Risk Factors—If pet care providers are reclassified as employees under applicable law, our business would be materially adversely affected.”
Other types of new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our business and related technologies. For instance, state and local governments have in the past pursued, or may in the future pursue or enact, licensing, zoning or other regulation that impacts the ability of individuals to provide home-based pet care.
We proactively work with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly.
