ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Company overview 
 We are focused on enhancing the way patients with cardiorenal and gastrointestinal, or GI, diseases are treated by using the gut as the gateway to delivering medicines that matter. We have pioneered the development of small molecule therapeutics that act predominantly in the GI tract, thereby avoiding potentially negative side effects on the rest of the body. 
 Our strategy is to develop therapeutics focused on addressing cardiorenal and gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We utilize our proprietary drug discovery and design platform by integrating technology that emulates the human GI tract with our gut-restriction chemistry capabilities. We have discovered and developed multiple portfolios of unique, gut-targeted therapeutics. 
 We plan to evolve from R&D-focused to an integrated biotech company, by building cardiorenal and GI businesses in the United States, while exploring a variety of strategic commercial options outside of the United States. Our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical programs are focused on evaluating our potential products in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C; end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, patients suffering from elevated phosphate, or hyperphosphatemia; and ESRD, chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and/or heart failure patients with elevated potassium, or hyperkalemia. 
 Overview of Our Cardiorenal Portfolio 
 Our cardiorenal portfolio is led by tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis. Tenapanor is a minimally-systemic small molecule that acts locally in the GI tract to inhibit the sodium transporter NHE3 and reduce sodium uptake from the gut. In human studies of orally-administered tenapanor, the drug was detected in the blood in less than 1% of thousands of collected serum samples, and even in those, at very low levels (< 1.5 ng/mL). We have evaluated tenapanor across 18 clinical studies in over 2,000 individuals to date. 
 Tenapanor has been specifically designed to work exclusively within the GI tract, thereby significantly reducing the amount of drug that is absorbed into the bloodstream and, we believe, reducing the potential side effects that could occur. When tenapanor blocks the NHE3 sodium transporter in the GI tract, thereby reducing the absorption of dietary sodium, there is a resulting increase in the protons within the cells. The increase in protons causes a selective reduction in phosphate uptake by tightening junctions or pores that regulate phosphate homeostasis, which then limits the amount of dietary phosphate that can pass from the gut into the blood. We have not observed this impact on other ions, nutrients or macromolecules in our clinical trials. 
 In February 2017, we reported data from the first Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in serum phosphorus levels from the end of the eight-week treatment period to the end of the four-week randomized withdrawal period between the tenapanor-treated group and the placebo-treated group in the responder patient population (mean -1.01 mg/dL, median of -1.3 mg/dL) and met its primary endpoint (95% confidence interval, -1.44, -0.21, LSmean -0.82 mg/dL, p=0.01). The responder population (n=80 out of 164) had a mean reduction in serum phosphorus from baseline to the end of the eight-week treatment period of 2.56 mg/dL, with a reduction of up to 5.7 mg/dL. Notably, in this group, 33 percent of patients had a reduction in serum phosphorus of greater than 3 mg/dL. Tenapanor was generally well-tolerated with only 7.8 percent of patients discontinuing treatment due to GI side effects. We expect to begin a second Phase 3 clinical trial in this indication in mid-2017. If data from this second Phase 3 trial are positive, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA requesting approval to market in the United States for hyperphosphatemia. We intend to build our own sales and marketing organization to market and sell tenapanor for hyperphosphatemia in the United States. We believe that there are over 745,000 ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia in major developed countries.

The second product candidate in our cardiorenal portfolio is RDX7675. RDX7675 is an oral, non-absorbed, potassium-binding polymer that is being evaluated for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a potentially severe condition that results from elevated blood potassium and is common in patients with CKD and heart failure. We have developed RDX7675 as a patented improvement to sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or SPS, an FDA-approved polymer that has been the standard of care for the treatment of hyperkalemia for more than 50 years. We have made several key physical and chemical modifications to this polymer to eliminate sodium, optimize binding capacity, improve mouth feel and develop formulations with a more pleasant taste that are easier to ingest. 
 In 2016, we announced positive results from a clinical study in healthy volunteers evaluating once daily, twice-daily and three-times-daily doses of RDX7675. The study demonstrated that RDX7675 effectively binds potassium in the GI tract and that it is generally well-tolerated at all doses in the study. In addition, in the once-daily dose group we observed a very similar effect on potassium binding as was seen in the two or three times daily dosing groups with the same total daily dose. Based on these data, we determined that once-daily dosing is the most appropriate dosing regimen for further evaluation in the treatment of hyperkalemia in our Phase 3 clinical trial. A separate study was conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the palatability of oral formulations of RDX7675 compared to SPS. RDX7675 consistently outperformed SPS in all aspects of the taste assessments, including mouth feel, texture and flavor. 
 We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of RDX7675 in late 2016. We also began an onset of action clinical trial of RDX7675 in late 2016 and expect to have results in the first half of 2017. If data from these clinical trials are positive, we expect to rely on the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to request marketing approval in the United States. We currently expect to establish our own cardiorenal sales and marketing organization to market and sell this product. We believe there are approximately two million people in the United States with CKD and/or heart failure who have hyperkalemia. 
 Our RDX013 program is aimed at discovering and evaluating orally-administered small molecule therapeutic candidates that modulate the transport of potassium in the GI tract. Our agents are designed to enhance potassium secretion in the colon to correct hyperkalemia in patients with CKD and/or heart failure. We have demonstrated proof-of-concept data with our RDX013 program molecules showing potassium secretion in preclinical models of disease. 
 RDX011 is our program focused on the discovery and development of second-generation NHE3 inhibitors. We have elucidated the mechanism of action of tenapanor as it relates to the inhibition of the absorption of dietary phosphorus, and we intend to leverage this knowledge as we seek to develop new products with selective properties. 
 Overview of Our Gastrointestinal Portfolio 
 Our gastrointestinal, or GI, portfolio is led by tenapanor for the treatment of IBS-C. Tenapanor is a minimally-systemic small molecule that acts locally in the GI tract to inhibit the sodium transporter NHE3 and reduce sodium uptake from the gut. We are currently evaluating tenapanor in two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with IBS-C, T3MPO-1 and T3MPO-2, which were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect to report results from T3MPO-1, a 12-week clinical trial, in mid-2017 and from T3MPO-2, a six-month clinical trial, in late 2017. We also expect to have results in late 2017 from T3MPO-3, a long-term safety study, which is enrolling patients who have completed T3MPO-1 or T3MPO-2.
We first reported positive data in October 2014 from the Phase 2b trial of tenapanor in patients with IBS-C. At the 50mg twice-daily dose, the study met its primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant increase in the complete spontaneous bowel movement, or CSBM, responder rate. The study also demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in pain and other measures of discomfort and that tenapanor was well-tolerated in this patient population. 
 If the Phase 3 clinical trials are positive, we expect to submit an NDA to the FDA to request marketing approval in the United States for IBS-C. We currently expect to establish our own sales and marketing 
 
3 
 
 organization to market and sell tenapanor for IBS-C in the United States. While estimates vary, it is projected that approximately 11 million people in the United States suffer from IBS-C.
A second candidate in our GI portfolio is RDX8940. RDX8940 is a minimally absorbed, oral TGR5 agonist for which we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, in late 2016. TGR5 is an important receptor present on cells within the GI tract that is activated by the bile acids that the body secretes in response to the food we ingest. As part of a normal physiological response, the binding of bile acids to TGR5 stimulates the production of critical metabolic hormones such as those involved in maintenance of the bodys reaction to nutrients and the maintenance and care of the structural integrity of the gut. Based on the preclinical data we have generated to date, we currently are evaluating development of RDX8940 for the treatment of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We are also evaluating the potential for RDX8940 in additional GI indications. 
 RDX011 is our second-generation NHE3 inhibitor. We intend to leverage our knowledge of NHE3 inhibitors and their effect on sodium and phosphate management as we seek to develop novel products. We also intend to evaluate new indications for tenapanor and other NHE3 inhibitors to exploit the unique capabilities and tools we have developed to modulate transport of ions and other processes in the gut. 
 The focus of our RDX023 program is on the discovery and development of gut-biased farnesoid X receptor, or FXR, agonists for the treatment of GI and inflammatory diseases. FXR is expressed at high levels in the liver and intestine and plays a central role in the regulation of bile acid and lipid homeostasis. Systemic FXR agonists appear to have limitations based on their potential to have undesirable and negative effects on multiple systems in the body. We are evaluating our differentiated gut-biased RDX023 program molecules in animal models of NASH/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, bile acid diarrhea and other indications. 
 OUR PROPRIETARY DRUG DISCOVERY AND DESIGN PLATFORM 
 The emerging view of the GI tract is that it is a critical and active sentinel organ that transmits signals from the environment to instruct other organs how to respond to a meal, the microbiome or even pathogens. We have created a unique discovery and design platform that permits us to discover targets found in the GI tract that regulate important processes in the body and design products candidates that act upon those targets in the GI tract to take advantage of the guts ability to communicate with other organs. Our platform integrates two critical concepts: (i) our proprietary chemistry capabilities that enable us to design and optimize gut-restricted compounds that can provide a higher margin of safety than systemically absorbed compounds, and (ii) our stem cell-based translational technology called the Ardelyx Primary Enterocyte and Colonocyte Culture System, or APECCS, that enables us to discover targets in the GI tract which control health and disease processes, to optimize drug candidates and to understand their mechanisms of action. Our platform can be applied across the entire GI tract, allowing for the broadest evaluation of disease targets to develop medicines optimized for specific diseases. The predictive ability of our platform enables us to better assess, at a very early stage, the potential for small molecule compounds to treat specific diseases. 
How Our Platform Works 
 We have developed several proprietary capabilities that allow us to discover and design new gut-restricted compounds, including the following: 
 1.    Gut-restriction Chemistry. Since our founding almost ten years ago, we have become experts in the development of gut-restricted small molecules. This has required the development of new techniques to ensure that the small molecules are not absorbed. Gut-restriction chemistry includes a suite of proprietary techniques, technology and know-how that we have developed in order to restrict the mechanism of the drug to targets within the GI tract. Drugs that have minimal absorption have the potential to provide greater safety than drugs that are absorbed. 
 
4 
 
2.    Stem Cell Technology. APECCS is an in-vitro capability we have developed and industrialized. We start with human stem cells obtained from biopsies from the intestinal tract of healthy or diseased patients. We grow these cells in conditions where the resulting tissue mimics the key aspects of the area of the human gastrointestinal tract from where the stem cells were derived. We can also achieve this process with mouse cells, allowing us to make the connection between mouse and human results. This, in turn, allows us to evaluate the potential efficacy of our drugs before we see their effects in humans. 
 OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE 
 The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates as of December 31, 2016: 
 

Cardiorenal Portfolio 
 Our cardiorenal portfolio includes two Phase 3 clinical product candidates, tenapanor in Phase 3 clinical development for treating hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis and RDX7675 in Phase 3 clinical development for treating hyperkalemia in CKD and heart failure patients. In addition to our two phase 3 product candidates, we have two programs that are in research phase. 
 Tenapanor for Treating Hyperphosphatemia in ESRD Patients on Dialysis 
 The lead product candidate in our cardiorenal portfolio is tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia, or high levels of blood phosphorus, in ESRD patients on dialysis. Hyperphosphatemia is a significant problem among dialysis patients worldwide. 
 CKD is the progressive deterioration of renal function that can occur over several months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are nonspecific, and can include having less energy, reduced appetite, dry itchy skin, swollen feet and ankles or generally just not feeling well. If the deterioration continues and is not halted by either changes in lifestyle or with the assistance of pharmacological intervention, the disease will likely cause significant cardiovascular morbidity, and can progress to ESRD, the final stage of CKD, where kidney function will be lost entirely. 
 
5 
 
Current management of ESRD includes hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis as a means to filter toxins from the blood once kidneys have failed. Unless this intervention occurs, kidney failure results in the accumulation of waste products that may ultimately cause death. Hemodialysis, the most common form of dialysis, generally requires a patient to visit a dialysis center at least three times per week for a three- to five-hour session, significantly reducing quality of life. 
 Phosphorus, a vital element required for most cellular processes, is present in almost every food in the Western diet, and, in individuals with normal kidney function, any excess dietary phosphorus is efficiently removed by the kidney and excreted in urine. In adults with functioning kidneys, normal serum phosphorus levels are 2.6 to 3.8 mg/dL. With kidney failure, elevated phosphorus becomes harmful and is diagnosed as hyperphosphatemia when serum phosphorus levels are greater than 5.0 mg/dL. Although patients with ESRD rely on dialysis to eliminate harmful agents, phosphorus is not readily removed by the procedure and other means of managing phosphorus levels must be employed. 
 In ESRD patients, excess levels of phosphorus has been shown to lead to an increase in cardiovascular disease risk, as well as increases in serum FGF-23, an important regulator of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. Highly elevated levels of FGF23 is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiac clinical outcomes as well as the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), marked by elevated parathyroid hormone. SHPT is associated with renal osteodystrophy, a condition of abnormal bone growth characterized by brittle bones. 
 Since dialysis is unable to efficiently eliminate excess phosphorus, ESRD patients are put on restrictive low phosphorus diets and are currently prescribed medications called phosphate binders, the only interventions currently marketed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Phosphate binders act by binding dietary phosphorus and commonly need to be taken with meals and snacks. They include calcium, iron or lanthanum, a rare-earth metal, which bind to and precipitate with dietary phosphate in the GI tract. The goal of these phosphorus binders is for patients to eliminate through their stool the precipitated phosphorus that comes from the food they ingest. A limitation of this approach is the systemic excess absorption of calcium, iron or lanthanum, resulting in side effects and other unintended consequences for ESRD patients. 
 Safety and tolerability have been significant concerns with many approved phosphate binders. The more common side effects of approved phosphate binders include long-term vascular calcification, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea or constipation and ileus or disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the GI tract. 
 ESRD patients, who generally are severely restricted in their fluid intake, are prescribed on average 19 oral pills per day, of which approximately 50% comprise phosphate binders to reduce serum phosphorus. The amount of phosphorus a binder can remove is limited by its binding capacity, and therefore, increasing the dose, and hence the pill burden, of the binder is the only way to increase the amount of phosphorus being bound and excreted. As a result of pill burden and mass, as well as a number of side effects, prescribed phosphate binder doses are intolerable for many patients. 
 We are developing tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis. Tenapanor has the potential to be the first small molecule approach to treating hyperphosphatemia, with a unique mechanism of action that acts by inhibiting, or blocking, the NHE3 transporter in the GI tract to reduce the absorption of dietary sodium. When tenapanor blocks the NHE3 sodium transporter in the GI tract, thereby reducing the absorption of dietary sodium, there is a resulting increase in the protons within the cells. The increase in protons causes a selective reduction in phosphate uptake by tightening junctions or pores that regulate phosphate homeostasis, which then limits the amount of dietary phosphate that can pass from the gut into the blood We have not observed this impact on other ions, nutrients or macromolecules in our clinical trials. We have submitted a manuscript for publication of this mechanism in a scientific peer-reviewed journal. Tenapanor has been specifically designed to work exclusively within the GI tract, thereby significantly reducing the amount of drug that is absorbed into the bloodstream and the potential side effects that could occur. In human studies of orally-administered tenapanor, the drug was detected in the blood in less than 1% in thousands of collected serum samples, and even in those, at very low levels (< 1.5 ng/mL). We have evaluated tenapanor across 18 clinical studies in over 2,000 individuals to date.

Clinical data supporting tenapanor in hyperphosphatemia 
 In February 2017, we announced data from our first Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis. 
 The Phase 3 trial was an eight-week, double-blind, randomized trial, with a four-week placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period. We enrolled a total of 219 ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia who are on dialysis. Enrolled patients were randomized evenly into three arms, in which all groups received tenapanor for eight weeks. Tenapanor was administered at doses of 3 mg or 10 mg twice-daily and in a dose-titration arm starting at 30 mg twice-daily with the option to down-titrate once a week during the first four weeks to 20, 15, 10 and 3 mg twice-daily, based on GI tolerability. After the end of the eight-week treatment period, patients were re-randomized 1:1 to either remain on their current tenapanor dose or switch to placebo for a four-week, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial was the difference in change in serum phosphorus between the pooled tenapanor-treated patients and placebo-treated patients from the end of the eight-week treatment period to the end of the four-week randomized withdrawal period, in the responder population. The responder population, which was reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is defined as patients who demonstrate a greater than or equal to 1.2 mg/dL decrease in serum phosphorus from baseline during the initial eight-week treatment period. 
 The study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in serum phosphorus levels from the end of the eight-week treatment period to the end of the four-week randomized withdrawal period between the tenapanor-treated group and the placebo-treated group in the responder patient population (mean -1.01 mg/dL, median of -1.3 mg/dL) and met its primary endpoint (95% confidence interval, -1.44, -0.21, LSmean -0.82 mg/dL, p=0.01). The responder population (n=80 out of 164) had a mean reduction in serum phosphorus from baseline to the end of the eight-week treatment period of 2.56 mg/dL, with a reduction of up to 5.7 mg/dL. Notably, in this group, 33 percent of patients had a reduction in serum phosphorus of greater than 3 mg/dL. 
 Tenapanor was well-tolerated in the trial. In the eight-week treatment period, the only adverse event that affected more than five percent of patients treated with tenapanor was diarrhea (39 percent), a patient-reported side effect of loosened stool or increased frequency in bowel movements regardless of magnitude. In the four-week randomized withdrawal period, there was a diarrhea rate of 1.2 percent for patients treated with tenapanor compared with 2.4 percent on placebo. Treatment discontinuations due to diarrhea for patients on tenapanor was 7.8 percent (n=17). There were no discontinuations due to diarrhea in the randomized withdrawal period. 
 In order to fully assess GI tolerability, patients used an eDiary to record the frequency of daily bowel habits, as well as stool form using the Bristol Stool Form Scale, or BSFS. During the eight-week treatment period, there was a 0.4 per day increase in bowel movement frequency from baseline, and during the four-week randomized withdrawal period, there was a 0.29 per day increase as compared to placebo. Bowel movement frequency was within the normal range in all groups. During the eight-week treatment period, there was a 0.87 point increase in BSFS from a baseline score of 4.2, out of a maximum of seven, where seven is liquid stool. During the four-week randomized withdrawal period, there was a 0.7 point difference in BSFS between placebo (4.4) and tenapanor treatment (5.1). 
 Based on the results from this trial, we intend to initiate a second Phase 3 study of tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients on dialysis in mid-2017. We currently expect that this Phase 3 study will include a 26-week open-label treatment period, with a randomized withdrawal period followed by an additional 26-week long-term safety extension. We currently intend to build our own sales and marketing organization to market and sell tenapanor for hyperphosphatemia in the United States. 
 The hyperphosphatemia market 
 Phosphate binders are the only drugs marketed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients. The various types of phosphate binders commercialized in the United States include the following: 
 

 | Calcium carbonate (many over-the-counter brands including Tums and Caltrate)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

 | Calcium acetate (several prescription brands including PhosLo and Phoslyra)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol marketed by Shire)
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel, marketed by Sanofi)
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | Sevelamer carbonate (Renvela, marketed by Sanofi)
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | Sucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro, marketed by Vifor Fresenius)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ferric citrate (Auryxia, marketed by Keryx)
--+--------------------------------------------

 The hydrochloride form of sevelamer, Renagel, was launched in the United States by Genzyme Corporation in 1998 prior to its acquisition by Sanofi, and the carbonate form, Renvela, was launched in 2008. Sanofi booked 935 million ($1.04 billion) in worldwide sales of sevelamer during 2015 and 687 million through September 30, 2016. Generic sevelamer was expected to enter the U.S. market in early 2014 after expiration of Sanofis patent, but as of 2017, no generic sevelamer has yet been approved in the United States. Generic sevelamer was approved, however, in certain jurisdictions in Europe in 2015. 
 Each of these agents has various limitations. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate can cause long term vascular calcification. Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) entered the market in 2004 as an alternative to calcium and aluminum based agents, but nephrologists concerns about the long term toxicity from the absorption of metals such as lanthanum and its GI side effect profile have limited its market penetration. Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) is an acidic formulation of sevelamer that has been linked with worsening of metabolic acidosis in some patients. Sevelamer carbonate (Renvela) was developed as an improved formulation of sevelamer to reduce incidence of metabolic acidosis. The active ingredient of both products, sevelamer, is associated long-term with vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), and flatulence (8%). Ferric citrate (Auryxia), an iron-based phosphate binder, was approved by the FDA in September 2014. While iron is often deficient in ESRD patients because of CKD-associated anemia and lack of sufficient dietary iron, the FDA has required Auryxia to add a warning of iron-overload in the label for use in ESRD. 
 In addition to the currently marketed phosphate binders, we are aware of at least two other binders in development, including fermagate (Alpharen), an iron-based binder in Phase 3 being developed by Opko Health, Inc., and PT20, an iron-based binder in Phase 3 being developed by Shield Therapeutics. 
 According to the most recent data available from the U.S. Renal Data System, in 2014 there were 428,558 patients on hemodialysis in the United States. Additionally, according to the European ERA-EDTA Registry 2012 Annual Report and a study in 2010 by the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, there were approximately 280,000 patients on hemodialysis in Europe and about 250,000 in Japan. We estimate, based on phosphate binder utilization, the only approved therapies for hyperphosphatemia, that there are approximately 300,000, 225,000 and 220,000 ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia in the United States, countries in Europe and Japan, respectively, resulting in approximately 745,000 ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia in such countries. 
 Because many ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia are unable to lower serum phosphorus levels to below 5.5 mg/dL with currently marketed phosphate binders, we believe there is a significant medical need for new agents with new mechanisms, demonstrated efficacy, a strong safety profile, and significantly lower pill burden. We believe that tenapanor, if approved, has the potential to have the lowest pill burden and mass among any currently marketed hyperphosphatemia products, with milligram rather than gram quantities. In addition, we may evaluate whether tenapanor has the potential to be used in combination with phosphate binders for those patients who cannot achieve adequate phosphate control with a single agent. 
 RDX7675 for treating hyperkalemia 
 The second product candidate in our cardiorenal portfolio is RDX7675. RDX7675 is an oral, non-absorbed, potassium-binding polymer that is being evaluated for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a potentially severe 
 
8 
 
 condition that results from elevated blood potassium. Hyperkalemia is generally defined as the presence of blood potassium levels greater than 5.0 mEq/L. Normal levels are 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L. When hyperkalemia is severe, above 7.0 mEq/L, there is a significantly increased risk of death because of the potential for heart conductance problems. 
 Hyperkalemia can be caused by a variety of sources. Kidney disease can result in the elevation of potassium in the blood. Also, certain drugs such as the common hypertension medications known as RAAS inhibitors, which inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, can cause hyperkalemia. As a result, the dosage of RAAS inhibitors must often be significantly reduced in patients whose potassium levels are elevated (such as in those with CKD and heart failure) because of the fear that elevated potassium can cause significantly worse problems than hypertension including sudden cardiac arrest in severe cases. In fact, despite the success of RAAS inhibitors in controlling blood pressure in these populations, several published guidelines have suggested that physicians should reduce and possibly discontinue RAAS inhibitors in order to manage the risk of hyperkalemia in CKD and heart failure patients. The alternative medications used to control hypertension, including diuretics and calcium channel blockers, are significantly less effective than RAAS inhibitors, particularly in patients with failing kidneys and severe hypertension. According to the publication Market Dynamix: Hyperkalemia released by Spherix Global Insights, U.S. cardiologists reported that of the patients who would benefit from RAAS inhibition, up to 38% of patients with heart failure and up to 55% of patients with both heart failure and CKD are being administered a sub-optimal dose or none at all, and nephrologists reported that at least one-third of patients who would benefit from RAAS inhibition receive a sub-optimal dose or none at all. We believe there is a strong medical need for new medications that control hyperkalemia in order to allow for continued use of RAAS inhibitors to control hypertension in these patient populations. 
 RDX7675 is an oral, non-absorbed, potassium-binding polymer that has demonstrated effective binding to potassium in pharmacodynamics studies in healthy volunteers. Using our unique chemistry, we have designed RDX7675 as a patented improvement to sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or SPS, an FDA approved polymer that has been the standard-of-care for the treatment of hyperkalemia for more than 50 years. We made several key physical and chemical modifications to eliminate sodium and sorbitol, optimize binding capacity, greatly improve palatability and develop formulations that would taste pleasant and be easier to ingest. We believe these improvements offer unique advantages for patients with hyperkalemia and could increase patient satisfaction and compliance. 
 Clinical data supporting RDX7675 in hyperkalemia 
 In January 2016, we announced results from an open-label pharmacodynamic study of RDX7675 in healthy adult volunteers. The study consisted of a two-day treatment-free baseline period and a four-day treatment period. The study included four cohorts, and in each cohort 12 subjects received RDX7675 and three subjects received a similar dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or SPS for a total of 60 subjects. RDX7675 was administered at 4.6 g BID (9.2 g/day), 6.9 g BID (13.8 g/day), 4.6 g TID (13.8 g/day) and 9.2 g TID (27.5 g/day), and resulted in a mean increase of fecal potassium from baseline of 888 mg/day, 1,791 mg/day, 1,408 mg/day, and 1,670 mg/day, respectively. RDX7675 was generally well-tolerated at all doses and demonstrated comparable results to those observed with SPS. Other fecal electrolytes were monitored during the study and no unexpected changes were observed; in particular, fecal magnesium remained unchanged from baseline. 
 Sodium is currently used as a counter-ion in SPS products marketed in the United States and certain other products under development. We formulated RDX7675 with a calcium counter-ion, rather than a sodium counter-ion, as adding sodium to the daily intake of the target patient population runs counter to best clinical practice. In patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the standard of care is a low-sodium diet as sodium can contribute to fluid overload and edema, a common experience for these patients. In addition, excess sodium diminishes the beneficial effects of blood pressure drugs such as RAAS inhibitors. We have also improved both the physical properties of polystyrene sulfonate and the formulation in a manner that we expect may lead to improved patient adherence and compliance. Notably, in a single center, randomized, crossover study to evaluate 
 
9 
 
 various oral formulations of RDX7675 in healthy subjects, RDX7675 consistently outperformed SPS in all aspects of the taste assessments, including mouth feel, texture and flavor. 
 In December 2016, we initiated two clinical trials: an onset of action clinical trial and a Phase 3 clinical trial. The onset of action trial is designed to evaluate the effect of RDX7675 on the rate of blood potassium lowering, along with safety and efficacy, in approximately 60 patients with hyperkalemia. Data from this trial are expected in the first half of 2017. This will mark the first time we will have efficacy and safety data from RDX7675 in a patient population with hyperkalemia. The Phase 3 clinical trial will enroll patients with hyperkalemia who are taking RAAS inhibitor medications. The trial will include three parts: Part A will be a single-blind study in which all subjects receive RDX7675 for four weeks; Part B will be an eight-week, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized withdrawal study; and Part C is an open label long term safety study for subjects from Parts A and B. The primary endpoint for Part A is serum potassium change from Part A baseline, and the primary endpoint for Part B is serum potassium change from Part B baseline (RDX7675 versus placebo). If these clinical trials are positive, we would expect to submit an NDA to the FDA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to request marketing approval of RDX7675 for hyperkalemia in the United States. We currently expect to establish our own sales and marketing organization to sell this product. 
 The hyperkalemia market 
 Based on various literature sources, we believe there are approximately 2 million people with CKD and/or heart failure in the United States annually who also have occurrences of hyperkalemia. According to a retrospective observational study of a national cohort of 246,000 veterans cared for in the Veterans Health Administration, about 21% and 42% of patients with CKD Stage 3b and Stage 4, respectively, had a hyperkalemic event during a 12-month period, suggesting that hyperkalemia affects about 900,000 individuals with CKD Stage 3b or Stage 4 in the United States. According to the United States Renal Data System 2014 Atlas of CKD & ESRD, over 50% of CKD Stage 3b and Stage 4 patients are prescribed RAAS inhibitors because of their efficacy in controlling hypertension and success in slowing the clinical course of CKD. Additionally, according to the American Heart Association, 5.7 million Americans are living today with heart failure. Our proprietary research suggests that up to 16%, or approximately 900,000, of these patients had hyperkalemia during a 12-month period. Over half of heart failure patients are prescribed RAAS inhibitors. Our proprietary research also suggests that up to 200,000 patients with ESRD could benefit from an agent that treats hyperkalemia. 
 We are aware of at least two drugs approaching or on the market for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Veltassa (patiromer FOS), an oral, polymer-based potassium binder, was approved for marketing by the FDA in October 2015 and was commercially launched by Relypsa, which was acquired by Galenica AG for $1.5 billion in September 2016. Additionally, ZS Pharma submitted an NDA in June 2015 for ZS-9, a sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-based oral potassium binder. ZS-9 is expected to commercially launched by AstraZeneca, which acquired ZS Pharma in December 2015 for $2.7 billion. 
 RDX013 Program: Small Molecule for Treating Hyperkalemia 
 Our RDX013 program is aimed at discovering and evaluating orally-administered small molecule therapeutic candidates that modulate the transport of potassium in the GI tract. Our agents are designed to enhance potassium secretion in the colon to correct hyperkalemia in patients with CKD and/or heart failure. We have demonstrated proof-of-concept data with RDX013 showing potassium secretion in preclinical models of disease. 
 RDX011 Program: Second-Generation NHE3 Inhibitor 
 RDX011 is our program focuses on the discovery and development of second-generation NHE3 inhibitors. We have elucidated the mechanism of action of tenapanor as it relates to inhibition of dietary phosphorus, and we intend to leverage this knowledge as we seek to develop new products with selective properties.

Gastrointestinal Portfolio 
 Our gastrointestinal portfolio includes two product candidates, tenapanor in Phase 3 clinical development for treating IBS-C and RDX8940, a TGR5 agonist for which we have filed an IND in late 2016 to begin clinical studies, as well as two programs that are in the research phase. 
 Tenapanor: NHE3 Inhibitor for Treating IBS-C
IBS-C is a GI disorder in which abdominal pain or discomfort is associated with constipation, and which significantly impacts the health and quality of life of affected patients. In a third-party study, over 50% of IBS-C patients rated their pain, constipation and straining as being extremely bothersome. In the same study, GI symptoms led to an average 4.9 days of disrupted productivity and 0.8 days of missed work per month. There is no specific test or biomarker for IBS-C and therefore its presence is diagnosed by symptoms and by eliminating other disorders. IBS-C is very similar to chronic constipation and is clinically distinguished by a significant abdominal pain component. 
 Tenapanor is a minimally-systemic small molecule that acts locally in the GI tract to inhibit the sodium transporter NHE3 and reduce sodium uptake from the gut. Part of its mechanism to treat IBS-C constipation is an osmotic effect in the intestines  water follows salt and stool is gently loosened by the bodys own fluids. We are also continuing to evaluate the mechanism that explains the effect of tenapanor on pain in IBS-C. In human studies of orally-administered tenapanor, the drug was detected in the blood in less than 1% in thousands of collected serum samples, and even in those, at very low levels (< 1.5 ng/mL). We have evaluated tenapanor across 18 clinical studies in over 2,000 individuals to date. 
 Clinical data supporting tenapanor in IBS-C
We conducted a Phase 2b clinical trial in IBS-C patients and announced results from that study in October 2014. The clinical trial was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three dose levels of tenapanor in 356 patients with IBS-C as defined by the Rome III criteria and who had active disease as determined during a two-week screening period. Patients who qualified and who were randomized into the study received 5, 20, or 50 mg of tenapanor or placebo twice daily for 12 consecutive weeks. At the end of this treatment period, patients were followed for an additional four weeks. The results were reported on an intent-to-treat basis. 
 The primary endpoint, CSBM responder rate, was achieved in 60.7% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 33.7% receiving placebo (p<0.001). A CSBM responder was defined as a patient who had an increase of greater than or equal to one CSBM from baseline during six out of 12 weeks. We also measured a more stringent CSBM responder rate where a responder was defined as a patient who an increase of greater than or equal to one CSBM from baseline and had three or more CSBMs per week during nine out of 12 weeks. The CSBM nine of 12-week responder rate was achieved in 23.8% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 7.9% receiving placebo (p<0.004). 
 An abdominal pain responder was achieved in 65.5% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 48.3% receiving placebo (p<0.026). An abdominal pain responder was defined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% decrease in abdominal pain from baseline for six of 12 weeks. We also measured a more stringent abdominal pain responder rate where a responder was defined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% decrease in abdominal pain from baseline for nine of 12 weeks. For this more stringent abdominal pain measurement, the abdominal pain nine of 12 responder rate was achieved in 48.8% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 31.5% receiving placebo (p<0.022). 
 The overall responder rate, or dual composite endpoint percent, was achieved in 50% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 23.6% receiving placebo (p<0.001). An overall responder was defined as a patient who was a CSBM responder and an abdominal pain responder during the same week for six of 12 weeks. We also measured a more stringent overall responder rate where a responder was defined as a patient who was 
 
11 
 
 both a CSBM responder and an abdominal pain responder during the same week for nine of 12 weeks. The overall nine of 12-week responder rate was achieved in 20.2% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 6.7% receiving placebo (p<0.01). 
 Most other secondary endpoints measured also demonstrated significant improvements for patients receiving 50 mg tenapanor twice daily compared to placebo-treated patients. 
 A dose response relationship among all doses was observed in the primary endpoint, as well as in most secondary endpoints, although statistical significance was not achieved at the 5 mg or 20 mg doses. Additionally, the activity of tenapanor was maintained throughout the entire 12-week treatment period. 
 Tenapanor was well-tolerated in these patients, and the safety results were consistent with those observed in previous tenapanor trials. The most common adverse events at 50 mg twice daily (greater than or equal to 5%) that occurred more frequently in tenapanor-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients were diarrhea at 11.2% vs. 0%, and urinary tract infections at 5.6% vs. 4.4%. Overall rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4.5% for the tenapanor-treated patients (50 mg twice daily) and 3.3% for the placebo-treated patients. Based on the analysis of plasma samples tested as part of the study, the minimally-systemic nature of tenapanor was confirmed. 
 We are currently conducting two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States with tenapanor in IBS-C patients, T3MPO-1 and T3MPO-2. T3MPO-1 is a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, randomized trial with a 4-week, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period. T3MPO-2 is a six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center, randomized trial. The primary endpoint in each of the trials is the six of 12-week overall responder rate. An overall responder is defined as a weekly responder for six of 12 weeks where both the abdominal pain response and the CSBM response criteria are met during the same week. An abdominal pain responder is defined as a patient with a 30% or greater reduction in average weekly worst abdominal pain compared to baseline during the week, and a CSBM responder is defined as a patient who has an increase of one or more in average weekly CSBMs compared to baseline during the week. We are also evaluating other endpoints in these studies, including CSBM and abdominal pain responder rates for six of 12 weeks as well as for nine of 12 weeks, abdominal symptoms and other clinically relevant endpoints. The T3MPO-1 trial is fully enrolled with over 600 patients, and we expect to report trial results in mid-2017. The T3MPO-2 trial fully enrolled with over 600 patients and with results from this trial by year-end 2017. Patients completing T3MPO-1 and T3MPO-2 are eligible to enroll into T3MPO-3, an open-label, long-term safety study where patients can continue to receive tenapanor for up to one year. By year-end 2017, we also expect to have T3MPO-3 data from a sufficient number of patients required to support the NDA filing of tenapanor. If these trials are successful, we currently expect to submit an NDA to the FDA in 2018 for marketing approval in the United States and we currently expect to commence a clinical program to evaluate tenapanor in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). 
 The IBS-C market 
 Numerous treatments exist for the constipation component of IBS-C, many of which are over-the-counter. We are aware of two prescription products marketed for IBS-C, Linzess (linaclotide) marketed by Ironwood Pharmaceuticals and Allergan and Amitiza (lubiprostone) marketed by Sucampo and Takeda. In two Phase 3 clinical trials of Linzess in IBS-C patients, the placebo-adjusted rate of IBS-C patients reaching the primary endpoint, overall responder rate, indicating a significant response during six out of 12 weeks of treatment, was 12.6% and 19.8%, respectively. In these studies, Linzess caused diarrhea in up to 17% more patients than placebo. Trulance (plecanatide) was approved by the FDA in January 2017 for use in adults for treatment of CIC, and Synergy Pharmaceuticals, the drugs manufacturer, presented Phase 3 data from two clinical studies of Trulance in IBS-C patients in December 2016. In one study, the placebo-adjusted rate of IBS-C patients reaching the primary endpoint, overall responder rate, indicating a significant response during 6 out of 12 weeks of treatment, was 7.3% and 9.8% of patients receiving 3mg and 6mg, respectively. In the other study, the placebo-adjusted rate of IBS-C patients reaching the same primary endpoint was 12.4% and 11.7% of patients receiving 
 
12 
 
 3mg and 6mg, respectively. Synergy has stated its intent to submit an NDA for Trulance in IBS-C in the first quarter 2017. 
 We believe that tenapanor may offer a significant benefit over currently marketed drugs like Amitiza, Linzess and Trulance, in part because of the efficacy and tolerance profile demonstrated in our Phase 2b clinical trial. Within the United States, there are approximately 11 million patients that suffer that suffer from IBS-C. There is significant unmet need for prescription medications, where only 1 in 4 treated patients were very satisfied with the current FDA approved treatments in IBS-C.
RDX8940: TGR5 Agonist 
 RDX8940 is a minimally absorbed, oral TGR5 agonist for which we submitted an IND in late 2016. In light of the pre-clinical data, we are evaluating the development of RDX8940 for the treatment of patients with NASH and other gastrointestinal indications. 
 TGR5 is an important receptor present on cells within the GI tract that is activated in response to the bile acids the body secretes in response to the food we ingest. As part of a normal physiological response, the binding of bile acids to TGR5 stimulates the production of critical metabolic hormones such as glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2, or GLP-1 and GLP-2. GLP-1 is involved in maintaining insulin sensitivity and in aiding glucose and lipid metabolism. GLP-2 is involved in maintenance of the structural integrity of the gut as well as its growth. 
 We believe that endogenous and local secretion of GLP-1 and GLP-2 triggered by the stimulation of TGR5 receptors by an oral TGR5 agonist may have significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of several conditions. Injectable GLP-1 analogs are being evaluated in the treatment of NASH because they are known to improve lipid metabolism in the liver. Injectable stabilized GLP-1 analogs that are commercially available, such as exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza), are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, among other metabolic conditions. An injectable, stabilized form of GLP-2, called Gattex (teduglutide), is marketed for short bowel syndrome. GLP-2 stimulates the repair of the gut and improves the structural integrity of gut wall that is damaged in many disease conditions. A leaky gut, and the corresponding systemic inflammation, is also believed to be involved in the pathology of NASH. In all of these cases, GLP-1 and GLP-2 analogs are injectable thus we believe an oral agent that can emulate these effects would be welcome. 
 Historically one of the limitations for the development of TGR5 agonists has been the observation with systemic compounds that stimulation of TGR5 in the gallbladder results in excess gallbladder filling, potentially increasing the risk of gallstones. Using our approach to design small molecules, we have created novel TGR5 agonist candidates that have extremely low systemic exposure and we have shown that these agents do not result in excess gallbladder filling in preclinical animal models. 
 RDX8940 has demonstrated proof-of-concept in an animal efficacy model of NASH. We submitted an IND at year-end 2016 to begin evaluation of RDX8940 in healthy adult subjects. This study is designed to include a single dose evaluation of RDX8940 followed by a multiple ascending dose evaluation of RDX8940, with and without DPP-IV inhibitors. Results of this clinical trial will provide important safety assessments, data regarding gut hormone responses such as GLP-1 and GLP-2 and any potential gallbladder effects, all of which will inform our next steps for this program and its potential utility in NASH and other GI disorders. 
 RDX011 Program: Second-Generation NHE3 Inhibitors 
 RDX011 is a program in our GI portfolio focused on leveraging our knowledge of NHE3 inhibitors and their effect on sodium and phosphate management as we seek to develop novel products. We also intend to evaluate new indications for tenapanor and other NHE3 inhibitors in order to exploit the unique capabilities and tools we have developed to modulate transport of ions and other processes in the gut. 
 RDX023 Program: Gut-Biased Farnesoid X Receptor Agonists 
 The focus of our RDX023 program is on the discovery and development of gut-biased FXR agonists for the treatment of GI and inflammatory diseases. FXR is expressed at high levels in the intestine and liver and plays a 
 
13 
 
 central role in the regulation of bile acid and lipid homeostasis. Systemic FXR agonists appear to have limitations based on their potential to have undesirable and negative effects on multiple systems in the body. We are evaluating our differentiated gut-biased RDX023 program molecules in animal models of NASH/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, irritable bowel disease, or IBD, bile acid diarrhea and other indications. 
 We presented data at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases conference in November 2016 demonstrating proof of concept that a novel, orally administered, intestinal-selective FXR agonist reduced liver steatosis, or infiltration of liver cells with fat, in mice. We intend to designate a lead development candidate from this program in 2017. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and operation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 As a normal course of business, we pursue composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents for our product candidates in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection for broader structural and functional attributes of our product candidates that enable a minimally-systemic or minimally-systemic profile. 
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of our issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, which would result in substantial costs to us even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patents term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. 
 In addition, in the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process occurring while the patent is in force. A patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and 
 
14 
 
 consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaboration partners, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning the business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individuals relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during the normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 
 NHE3 patents 
 Our NHE3 patent portfolio is wholly owned by us. This portfolio includes four issued U.S. patents, two issued Japanese patents, and one issued Mexican patent. These issued patents cover the composition and methods of using tenapanor and are predicted, without extension or adjustment, to expire in 2029. We have related national patent applications pending in Europe, China, India, Israel and a number of other countries. Any patents issuing from these patent applications are also predicted without extension or adjustment to expire in 2029. 
 Additional U.S. and international patent applications are pending covering additional methods of using tenapanor, and composition of matter and methods of using compounds that we believe may be follow on compounds to tenapanor. 
 RDX7675 
 We have an issued patent in the United States that covers the composition of matter of RDX7675, and we have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally covering the composition and methods of using RDX7675. Our issued patent will provide coverage through 2035 without extensions or adjustments. 
 RDX8940 
 We have patent applications pending in the United States and internationally that cover the compositions and methods of using our TGR5 agonists. 
 MANUFACTURING 
 To date, we have relied upon third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product dosage forms of our potential drug candidates used as clinical trial material. We expect that we will continue to rely upon CMOs for the manufacture of our clinical trial materials for our own internal programs. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION/FDA 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and export and import of our product candidates. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to 
 
15 
 
 approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
 

 | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies, some performed in accordance with the FDAs current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or commercial shipment of the drug.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 An independent IRB or ethics committee for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent. 
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct 
 
16 
 
 a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and if the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. GCP includes review and approval by an independent ethics committee, such as an IRB, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject before study initiation. If the applicant seeks approval of an NDA solely on the basis of foreign data, the FDA will only accept such data if they are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or through other appropriate means. 
 Clinical trials 
 The clinical investigation of a new drug is typically conducted in three or four phases, which may overlap or be combined, and generally proceed as follows. 
 

 | Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsors agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the abovementioned studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
17 
 
The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 New drug applications 
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs of new molecular entities within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, or six months after the 60-day filing review period for priority review NDAs, but this timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGCP requirements is satisfactory. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. 
 Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a 
 
18 
 
 clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our drug candidates for the proposed indication, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Nonclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, but excluding efficacy supplements to an NDA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Other regulatory requirements 
 Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaboration partners pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label use. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAs prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended 
 
19 
 
 use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed abbreviated because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subjects bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicants drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
 Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicants favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsors decision to initiate patent litigation. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drugs approval. As a general matter, the three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the 
 
20 
 
 FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 
 Fraud and abuse laws 
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. These laws include but are not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 
 In addition to the laws described above, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or 
 
21 
 
 investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. 
 Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal laws discussed above. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of pricing and marketing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with such laws, which may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and perhaps federal, authorities. 
 Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Due to the breadth of these laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers might be challenged under such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. 
 Third-party coverage and reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial managed care providers. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for our product candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our future sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In addition, in July 2010, CMS released its final rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for the treatment of ESRD patients as required by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, or MIPPA. The bundled payment includes all renal dialysis services furnished for outpatient maintenance dialysis, including ESRD-related drugs and biologicals. The final rule delayed the inclusion of oral medications without intravenous equivalents in the bundled payment until January 1, 2014 and in April 2014, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, such inclusion will remain delayed until January 1, 2025. Unless additional Congressional action is taken, beginning in 2025 ESRD-related drugs will be included in the bundle and separate Medicare reimbursement will no longer be available for such drugs, as it is today under Medicare Part D. While it is too early to project the full impact bundling may have on the phosphate binder industry, the impact could potentially cause dramatic price reductions for tenapanor, if approved.

Healthcare reform 
 In March 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a healthcare reform measure, often called, the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. 
 The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, which impacted existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. 
 Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 
 

 | increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expands access to commercial health insurance coverage through new state-based health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, beginning January 2011; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administrations policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trumps administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2 percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was enacted, 
 
23 
 
 which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. These new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products. 
 Other regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 93 full-time employees, including a total of 23 employees with Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 68 employees are engaged in research and development and the remaining 25 in general management and administration, including finance, legal, and business development. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
