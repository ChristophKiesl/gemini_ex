Item 1. Business.
Overview
Clean Energy Fuels Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a leading renewable energy company focused on the procurement and distribution of renewable natural gas (“RNG”) and conventional natural gas, in the form of compressed natural gas (“CNG”) and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), for the United States and Canadian transportation markets. RNG, which is delivered as either CNG or LNG, is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane (“biogas”) from non-fossil fuel sources - such as dairy and other livestock waste and landfills - for beneficial use as a replacement for fossil-based transportation fuels. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gasses (“GHG”) with a comparative impact on global warming that is about 25 times more powerful than that of carbon dioxide. We are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG (procured from our own projects or from third parties) to our customers in the heavy and medium -duty commercial transportation sector. We have participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for over 20 years and believe we are the largest U.S. provider of RNG for commercial transportation. We are in a unique position because the valuable Environmental Credits (as defined below) are generated by the party that dispenses RNG into vehicle fuel tanks, and we believe we have access to more dispensers than any other market participant.
We believe we were the first organization to supply RNG for vehicle fuel use in the U.S., and sales of our RNG for such purpose have increased from 13.0 million gasoline gallon equivalents (“GGEs”) in 2013 to 153.3 million GGEs in 2020. Overall, we are also the country’s leading provider of the cleanest fuels for the commercial transportation market, based on both the number of stations we operate and the amount of GGEs delivered of RNG, CNG and LNG, which amounted to a total of 382.5 GGEs in 2020. With the Company’s focus on RNG, our sales of RNG have grown from 12% of our vehicle fuel sales in 2013 to 74% of our vehicle fuel sales in 2020. We believe that during 2020 we provided 61% and 45% of the RNG used for transportation fuel in California and the United States, respectively. 
As a comprehensive clean energy solutions provider, we also design and build, as well as operate and maintain (“O&M”), public and private vehicle fleet customer stations in the United States and Canada; sell and service compressors and other equipment used in RNG production and at fueling stations; transport and sell our fuels via “virtual” natural gas pipelines and interconnects; sell U.S. federal, state and local government credits (collectively, “Environmental Credits”) we generate by selling RNG as a vehicle fuel; and obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives. We serve fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users, and government fleets. We believe these fleet markets will continue to present a growth opportunity for our vehicle fuels for the foreseeable future.
Commercial transportation, including heavy-duty trucking, generates a significant portion of the emissions of overall carbon dioxide and other climate-harming GHGs, and transitioning this sector to low and negative carbon fuels is a critical step towards reducing the overall global GHG emissions. According to the Global Carbon Project’s Global Carbon Budget published in December 2019, 36.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide were emitted globally in 2018, of which 7.0 billion metric tons, or 19%, came from the transportation sector. There is a global demand for reducing GHG emissions, as evidenced by 96% of the world’s countries having committed to the Paris Agreement according to The United Nations Framework Convention in Climate Change, 86% of S&P 500 companies focusing on sustainability metrics, including GHG emissions, according to the Governance & Accountability Institute’s Flash Report published on May 16, 2019 and 81% of global respondents from The Conference Board Global Consumer Confidence Survey, conducted in collaboration with Nielsen and published on September 11, 2018, indicating they want companies to better address environmental issues.
Biogas, the primary source of RNG, is produced by microbes as they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Our sources of commercial scale biogas are anaerobic digester gas (“ADG”), which is produced inside an airtight tank used to breakdown organic matter such as dairy and other livestock waste, and landfill gas (“LFG”), which is produced by the decomposition of organic waste at landfills.

Given the potential growth and positive environmental impact of RNG, our mission is to obtain as much RNG supply as possible. To that end we are pursuing development and ownership of dairy and other livestock waste ADG projects on our own and with partners including Total S.E. (“Total”) and BP Products North America (“bp”). Further, we enter long-term RNG supply offtake agreements with well-known third parties that own RNG production facilities. Because our business transforms waste methane into a renewable source of energy, our RNG generates valuable Environmental Credits under federal and state initiatives.
Depending on the source, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) has determined that RNG can have a significantly negative carbon intensity score, enabling our customers to achieve a net carbon negative emissions profile. 

California Air Resources Board “Current Fuel Pathways” 2018 – 2020 (5th-95th percentile)
​
At present, we believe the best use of RNG is as a replacement for fossil-based fuel in the transportation sector. We deliver RNG to the transportation market through 540 fueling stations we own, operate or supply in 39 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S., including over 200 stations in California. Critically, to generate valuable Environmental Credits the RNG must be placed in vehicle fuel tanks. We believe our stations and customer relationships allow us to deliver substantially more RNG to vehicle operators than any other participant in the market – we calculate that we have access to more fueling stations and vehicle fleets than all our competitors combined. As of December 31, 2020, we serve over 1,000 fleet customers operating over 48,000 vehicles on our fuels. We believe we are the only company in the U.S. that provides RNG vehicle fuel at scale in California and nationally.
Longer term, we expect to also be able to provide hydrogen fuel to vehicle fleets. As operators deploy more hydrogen powered vehicles, we can modify our fueling stations to reform our RNG and deliver clean hydrogen to customers. We also have the capability to add electric vehicle charging at our station sites, and we believe our RNG can be used to generate clean electricity to power electric vehicles.

Our Principal Products, Services and Other Business Activities
Our principal products, services and other business activities are described below. Information about the revenue we receive from these activities is discussed in this report in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

RNG, CNG and LNG Sales.

● | Unlike other renewables, RNG is easily stored, distributed, and replenished. RNG can be injected into the existing natural gas distribution network and delivered to vehicle fuel stations and liquefaction facilities. While other sources of green and renewable energy require significant infrastructure buildout to be implemented, RNG is affordably and easily used in existing infrastructure and vehicles today. Further, CARB has determined that RNG holds the lowest carbon intensity of any on-road vehicle fuel, including fully renewable electric from solar and wind. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CNG is RNG or conventional natural gas that is compressed and dispensed in gaseous form. CNG is typically delivered by obtaining RNG or conventional natural gas from the pipeline and then compressing and storing it at a fueling station and dispensing it directly into a vehicle. Our CNG vehicle fuel sales are made primarily through contracts with our customers or on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access fueling stations based on prevailing market conditions. Through our subsidiary NG Advantage, LLC (“NG Advantage”), we also transport and sell CNG for non-vehicle purposes via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects to industrial and institutional energy users that do not have direct access to pipelines. NG Advantage also has the capability to transport RNG from production facilities to pipeline injection sites using its fleet of 113 high-capacity trailers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | LNG is RNG or conventional natural gas that is cooled at a liquefaction facility to approximately -260 degrees Fahrenheit until it condenses into a liquid. We obtain LNG from our own liquefaction plants and from third-party suppliers. We own and operate LNG liquefaction plants near Boron, California and Houston, Texas, which we refer to as the “Boron Plant” and the “Pickens Plant,” respectively. In 2020, we purchased 9.8% of our LNG from third-party suppliers, and we produced the remainder of our LNG at our plants. We sell LNG for use as a vehicle fuel on a bulk basis to fleet customers and through our network of public access fueling stations. We deliver LNG with our fleet of 74 tanker trailers to fueling stations, where it is stored and then dispensed in liquid form into vehicles. The need to liquefy and transport LNG generally causes LNG to cost more than CNG. We sell LNG through supply contracts and on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access fueling stations based on prevailing market conditions. Additionally, we sell LNG for non-vehicle purposes, including to customers who use LNG in rocket propulsion and oil fields, and for utility, industrial, marine and rail applications.

Sales of Environmental Credits.   We generate Environmental Credits consisting of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs” or “RIN Credits”), as well as credits under the California and Oregon Low Carbon Fuel Standards (collectively, “LCFS Credits”), when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States, California, and Oregon, respectively. We sell these Environmental Credits to third parties who must comply with federal and state emissions requirements. Generally, the amount of Environmental Credits we generate increases as we sell higher volumes of RNG as a vehicle fuel. The number of Environmental Credits we sell and our revenue from these sales can vary depending on a number of factors, including the market for these credits, which has been volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in recent periods (for example, in 2020 market prices for RINs were as high as approximately $2.13 and as low as approximately $0.80), any changes to the federal and state programs under which the credits are generated and sold, and our ability to strictly comply with these programs.
O&M Services.   We perform maintenance service on Clean Energy-owned and customer-owned fueling stations. Our maintenance program is backed by nearly 200 company employed service technicians and support personnel, an in-house 24/7 remote monitoring center, technician training center, computerized maintenance management system and inventory warehouses throughout the United States and Canada. For maintenance services we generally charge a fixed fee or per gallon fee based on volume of fuel dispensed at the station.
Station Construction and Engineering.    We design and construct fueling stations and sell or lease some of these stations to our customers. Since 2008, we have served as the general contractor or supervised qualified third-party contractors to build over 430 natural gas fueling stations.

Grant Programs.    We apply for and help our fleet customers apply for federal, state and local grant programs in areas in which we operate. These programs can provide funding for vehicle purchases, fueling station construction and vehicle fuel sales.
Our Company’s Sustainability Program
Our vision is to deliver renewable transportation fuel for a cleaner, safer, more equitable tomorrow. We have a bold program, supported by ambitious goals to drive progress across three key pillars: fueling the transition to renewable energy in transportation, building the workforce for the future of renewable energy, and advancing smart policies that drive the transformation to zero carbon fuels.
Fueling Transportation’s Transition to Renewable Energy. 
The fuel we provide enables our customers to transition from diesel to a solution with significantly lower GHG emissions and air quality impacts today. We are committed to pushing ourselves and our partners further by helping to produce and distribute 100% RNG fuels, which can have a negative net emissions profile. We are also committed to doing our part to reduce our own emissions across our operations and supply chain.
Building the Workforce for the Future of Renewable Energy. 
At Clean Energy we have always had a strong focus on employee and contractor safety and strive to be a zero-incident workplace for our service technicians and staff, as well as our customers using our facilities. Looking towards the future, we will continue to focus on employee recruitment, retention, and engagement, with a specific emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in all areas of our company. It is important that we maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce and supplier base that is reflective of the communities in which we operate. We acknowledge the lack of diversity in the energy sector and strive to be part of the solution. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive leadership team and workforce. 
Advancing Smart Policies that Drive the Transformation to Zero Carbon Fuels. 
Widespread change will be necessary across all industries to achieve our collective climate goals. We recognize that some physical climate impacts are unavoidable in the near-term and that the transition to a low carbon economy may bring new risks to our business. We also recognize that natural gas extraction and processing causes environmental and social impacts that must be appropriately managed. By investing in the energy transition, our aim is to reduce our own risks and providing lasting benefits to society. To enable lasting change we must ensure the adoption of performance-driven state and federal policies that accelerate the shift from diesel and other transportation fuels with high GHG emissions and negative air quality impacts to zero net carbon emission transportation fuels. We are also committed to contributing to quality of life improvement and economic development in the communities where we conduct business, many of which are disadvantaged communities that suffer from poor air quality due to the use of transportation fuels, including diesel, that have high GHG emissions and significantly negative air quality impacts. 
Earn Stakeholder Trust. 
To realize our ambitious goals we are building trusted partnerships with our stakeholders. We strive to act ethically and responsibly in all aspects of our business, seeking to meet expectations related to human rights, labor standards, air quality, water stewardship, operational energy efficiency, biodiversity and land use, disaster preparedness, business ethics, and other material topics.
Market Opportunity
Increasing Demand for RNG
​
Demand for RNG produced from biogas is significant and growing in large part due to an increased focus by the U.S. public and investors, as well as federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, on reducing the emission of GHG, such as 

6



methane. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), methane is a significant GHG, which accounted for roughly 9.5% of all U.S. GHG emissions from human activities in 2018 and which has a comparative impact on global warming that is about 25 times more powerful than that of carbon dioxide. Biogas processing facilities substantially reduce methane emissions at livestock farms and landfills, which together accounted for approximately 27% of U.S. methane emissions in 2018 according to the EPA.
Over the past decade we have seen the transportation sector be the fastest growing end market for RNG, where RNG is used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth has been principally driven by increased focus on reducing GHGs, as well as Environmental Credits to support the production of renewable transportation fuels. According to NGV America, a national organization dedicated to the development of a growing, profitable, and sustainable market for vehicles powered by RNG, from 2015 to 2020, “RNG use as a transportation fuel…increased 291%, displacing close to 7.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.” Further, RNG engines now commercially available for heavy-duty, regional-haul, refuse, transit, and vocational applications have been certified to satisfy CARB’s optional low nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emission standard of 0.02 g/bhp-hr. This means that these engines emit 90% less smog-forming NOx than the existing regulatory standards, making them the lowest certified ultra-low NOx emission engines in the U.S.
Given public and investor calls for, and U.S. federal, state, and local regulatory trends and policies aimed at, reducing GHG emissions, we expect continued regulatory support for RNG as a replacement for fossil-based fuels and therefore continued and growing demand for RNG in the foreseeable future.
Increasing Vehicle Availability
RNG is a replacement for fossil-based fuel consumed by vehicles that use internal combustion engines like those used in gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles. Virtually any car, truck, bus, or other vehicle is capable of being manufactured to run on RNG. Many types and models of heavy- and medium-duty RNG vehicles and engines are available in the U.S., including, among others, long-haul tractors, refuse trucks, regional tractors, transit buses, ready-mix trucks, delivery trucks, vocational work trucks, school buses, shuttles, pickup trucks and cargo and passenger vans. 
More broadly, many companies are developing and commercializing hydrogen and electric commercial vehicles, particularly as the commercial transportation sector increasingly shifts toward low-emission, zero-emission, or carbon neutral vehicle solutions. Cummins, Daimler, Dana, Navistar, PACCAR, Volvo, XOS, Tesla and Nikola have announced their plans to bring long-haul Class 8 commercial hydrogen- and battery- powered vehicles to the market over the coming years.
Availability of Long-Term Feedstock Supply
Biogas is collected and processed to remove impurities for use as RNG and injected into existing natural gas pipelines. RNG is fully interchangeable with and chemically identical to conventional natural gas. Common sources of biogas include livestock farms, landfills, and wastewater resource recovery facilities (“WRRFs”). 
Livestock- and landfill-sourced biogas represent a significant opportunity to produce RNG and reduce GHG emissions. Although LFG has accounted for most of the growth in biogas projects to date, biogas from dairy and other livestock farm waste represents significant opportunities for RNG production that remain largely untapped. According to ICF Consulting, Inc., the global consulting services company, by 2040, the U.S. has the technical potential annually to produce up to 34.4 billion GGEs of RNG, including up to 20.6 billion GGEs of ADG RNG. 
All-in prices paid for RNG from livestock farms can be significantly higher than prices for RNG from landfills due to higher value available from state-level low-carbon fuel incentives for these projects. Given our market leadership in RNG, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of this market.
Total Joint Venture
On March 3, 2021, we entered an agreement (“Total JV Agreement”) with Total that created a 50/50 joint venture (“Total JV”) to develop ADG RNG production facilities in the United States. The Total JV Agreement contemplates that 

7



the Total JV will invest up to $400 million of equity in production projects, and Total and the Company each committed to initially provide $50 million for the Total JV. Pursuant to the Total JV Agreement, the Company and Total have given the Total JV a limited right of first opportunity to invest in ADG RNG projects they respectively originate. To fund our equity in the Total JV, we have the option to borrow $20 million from Société Générale pursuant to the term credit agreement described below under “Key Customer Markets – Zero Now.”
bp Joint Venture
On December 18, 2020, we entered a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with bp pursuant to which we and bp intend to create a joint venture (“bpJV”) that will develop, own, and operate ADG RNG production facilities. We and bp plan to share 50/50 control of the bpJV, we will have the option to contribute up to 50% of the bpJV’s capital, and 100% of the RNG produced from the projects developed and owned by the bpJV will be provided to the vehicle fuels market pursuant to our existing marketing agreement with bp.
Contemporaneous with the execution of the MOU, we and bp executed a loan agreement whereby bp advanced $50 million to us to fund capital costs and expenses incurred prior to formation of the bpJV, including capital costs and expenses for permitting, engineering, equipment, leases and feed stock rights (“Preformation Costs”). We expect that all unpaid principal and accrued interest outstanding under the loan agreement will be contributed to the bpJV, provided that if the bpJV is not formed by April 30, 2022, we are obligated to immediately repay all the outstanding principal and accrued interest, less 50% of the Preformation Costs within five days of April 30, 2022. The outstanding principal amount of the loan accrues interest at the rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 433 basis points; interest payable under the loan is offset by bp’s obligation to pay us a monthly management fee of $0.2 million pursuant to the MOU.
Use of Environmental Credits to Promote RNG Growth
When used as a transportation fuel, RNG can generate additional revenue streams through Environmental Credits. These Environmental Credits are provided for under a variety of programs, including the national Renewable Fuel Standards, or RFS, and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, programs.
The RFS program requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. To fulfill this regulatory mandate, the EPA obligates refiners and importers (“Obligated Parties”) to blend renewable fuel with standard fuel to meet renewable volume obligations (“RVOs”). Obligated Parties can comply with RVOs by either blending RNG into their existing fuel supply or purchasing Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs. RINs are generated when eligible renewable fuels are produced or imported and blended with a petroleum product for use as a transportation fuel. The RFS program has been a key driver of growth in the RNG industry since 2014 when the EPA ruled that RNG, when used as a transportation fuel, would qualify for D3 RINs (for cellulosic biofuels), which are generally the most valuable among the four categories of RINs. In 2020, we generated 45% of all D3 RINs in the U.S.
The monetization of RNG also benefits from low-carbon fuel initiatives at the state-level, specifically from established programs in California and Oregon. California’s LCFS (“CA LCFS”) program requires fuel producers and importers to reduce the carbon intensity (“CI”) of their products, with goals of a 10% reduction in carbon emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 and a 20% reduction by 2030. CARB awards CA LCFS credits to RNG projects based on each project’s CI score relative to the target CI score for gasoline and diesel fuels. The CI score represents the overall net impact of carbon emissions for each RNG pathway and is determined on a project-by-project basis. Because our business involves the capture and transformation of waste methane into a renewable source of energy, our customers are able to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, GHG emissions from their commercial transportation activities. Further, CARB calculates that RNG produced by livestock farms as carbon negative, generating substantial incremental CA LCFS credits. Multiple other states, including New York, Washington, New Mexico, and Colorado, are considering LCFS initiatives like those 

8



implemented in California and Oregon. In 2020, we generated 37% of all LCFS credits under Bio-CNG and Bio-LNG pathways in the CA LCFS.
Our Strategy 
We aim to maintain and increase our position as the leading provider of RNG to the commercial vehicle market in the U.S., and our goal is to deliver 100% RNG to our entire fueling infrastructure by 2025. We support this objective through a multi-pronged strategy of:

● | promoting the reduction of GHG emissions and expanding the use of renewable fuels to displace fossil-based fuels;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increasing supply of RNG through the development of new project investment opportunities, expanding our existing supplier portfolio, and leveraging our existing fuel network and customer relationships;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | empowering our customers to achieve their sustainability and carbon reduction objectives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exploiting our management expertise; and
--+-----------------------------------------


● | utilizing our environmental, health and safety and compliance leadership.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Promoting the Reduction of Methane Emissions and Expanding the Use of Renewable Fuels to Displace Fossil-Based Fuels.
We share the renewable fuel industry’s commitment to providing sustainable renewable energy solutions and to offering products with high economic and ecological value. By simultaneously replacing fossil-based fuels and reducing overall methane emissions, our business has a substantial positive environmental impact. We are committed to the sustainable development, deployment, and utilization of RNG to reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. In addition to its methane emission benefits, the increased production and use of RNG has several other environmental benefits. Anaerobically digested livestock waste produces significantly less odor than conventional storage and land application systems. The odor of stored livestock waste mainly comes from volatile organic acids and hydrogen sulfide, which has a “rotten egg” smell. In an anaerobic digester, volatile organic compounds are reduced to methane and carbon dioxide, which are odorless gases. The volatized fraction of hydrogen sulfide is captured with the collected ADG and destroyed. Anaerobic digestion provides several water quality and land conservation benefits as well. Digesters, particularly heated digesters, can destroy more than 90% of disease-causing bacteria that might otherwise enter surface waters and pose a risk to human and animal health. Digesters also reduce biochemical oxygen demand (“BOD”). BOD is one measure of the potential for organic wastes to reduce dissolved oxygen in natural waters. Because fish and other aquatic organisms need minimum levels of dissolved oxygen for survival, farm practices that reduce BOD protect the health of aquatic ecosystems. In addition to protecting local water resources, implementing anaerobic digesters on livestock facilities improves soil health. Adding digestate to soil increases the organic matter content, reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, improves plant growth and alleviates soil compaction. Further, digestion converts nutrients in manure to a more accessible form for plants to use. The risks of water and soil contamination from flooding of open lagoons are also mitigated by digesters.
Increasing Supply of RNG through the Development of New Project Opportunities, Expanding Our Existing Supplier Portfolio, and Leveraging our Extensive Fueling Station Network and Customer Relationships.  In our view, the market has not yet unlocked the full potential of RNG. We believe we were the first to deliver RNG to the commercial vehicle fuels market, have the most extensive RNG fueling infrastructure and customer relationships, and our stations and customer relationships allow us to obtain and deliver substantially more RNG to vehicle operators than any other participant in the market. This is important because RNG must be placed in vehicle fuel tanks to generate the valuable Environmental Credits. 
Dependable and economic sources of RNG are critical to our success. We continue to leverage our relationships built over the past several decades to identify and execute new RNG project development and supply offtake opportunities. 

9



These come from our relationships with feedstock owners and project developers who value our long operating history, strong reputation in the industry and unmatched access to fueling infrastructure and vehicle operators for certainty of Environmental Credit generation. Based on the foregoing, we believe that we are presented with nearly every material development, supply and distribution opportunity in the market.
We exercise financial discipline in pursuing projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects and associated feedstock costs and any related attributes that can be monetized. We also support third parties that own RNG production facilities by entering long-term RNG supply offtake agreements. As these facility owners expand their operations, we provide additional access to our fueling infrastructure and customer relationships.
As of December 31, 2020, we obtain RNG from over 30 supply sources. We believe that we have one of the largest and most diverse supply portfolios in the RNG industry, which allows us to provide certainty of RNG supply to our vehicle operator customers.
In our view, all the foregoing gives us a competitive advantage relative to existing and new market entrants.
Empowering our customers to achieve their sustainability and carbon reduction objectives.
In November 2021, global leaders will meet in Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to draw up a successor plan to the Paris Agreement. With evidence indicating that the Paris Agreement targets may fall short of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, governments and regulators globally face mounting public pressure to address the threat of climate change. President Biden has already issued an executive order for the United States to re-join the Paris Agreement and key investors have made climate change risk management a key priority: BlackRock has stated in its 2021 stewardship expectations guidelines that “[t]he events of [2020] have intensified our conviction that sustainability risk—and climate risk in particular—is investment risk” and plans to expand its engagement to the over 1,000 companies that are responsible for producing 90% of GHG emissions in its investment portfolio. Similarly, in his letter to boards, Cyrus Taraporevala, State Street’s CEO and President, said the asset manager will be elevating its focus on climate risk, noting that ahead of COP26, “policymakers are assessing progress on climate change action . . . many jurisdictions are signaling their intentions to make climate risk disclosure mandatory.” Vanguard has determined that “it is critical that public company boards fully understand and own climate-related risks.”
We are uniquely positioned to empower our customers to achieve their sustainability and carbon reduction goals. Because our business involves the capture and transformation of waste methane into a renewable source of energy, we believe our customers can significantly reduce, if not eliminate, GHG emissions from their commercial transportation activities. Further, our RNG is available today to reduce climate harming GHG and meet sustainability objectives and at a cost to customers that is very competitive to other fuels like diesel. We also assist our customers in their transition to cleaner transportation fuels by helping them obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives, providing vehicle financing, including through our Zero Now and Chevron Adopt-a-Port programs, engineering and constructing fueling stations, and facilitating customer selection of vehicle specifications that best meet their needs.
Management Expertise
Our management team has decades of combined experience in the alternative vehicle fueling industry. We believe our team’s proven track record in alternative vehicle fuels and focus on RNG gives us a strategic advantage in continuing to grow our business profitably. Our diverse experience and integration of key technical, environmental, and administrative support functions, along with our first-to-market advantage, further our ability to successfully delivery RNG to the commercial vehicle fuels market. 
Environmental, Health and Safety and Compliance Leadership
Our executive team places the highest priority on the health and safety of our staff and third parties, as well as the preservation of the environment. Our corporate culture is built around supporting these priorities, as reflected in our well-established practices and policies. By setting and maintaining high standards in the renewable energy field, we are often able to contribute positively to the safety practices and policies of our partners and customers. Our high safety standards 

10



include use of wireless gas monitoring safety devices, active monitoring of all field workers, performing environmental health and safety (“EHS”) audits and using technology throughout our safety processes from employee training in compliance with operational processes and procedures to emergency preparedness. By extension, we incorporate our EHS standards into our subcontractor selection qualifications to ensure that our commitment to high EHS standards is shared by our subcontractors. For 2020, excluding one incident related to COVID-19, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) was 1.43, which is lower than the 2019 national average of 3.00 TRIR for all industries. As of December 31, 2020, we have not received any U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“OSHA”) or state OSHA citations in the last five years.
How We Generate Revenue
We generate revenue from selling RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel, as well as selling the associated Environmental Credits. RNG made up 74% of our vehicle fuel sales in 2020, and we expect 100% of our vehicle fuel sales to be RNG by 2025. While RNG has the same chemical composition as natural gas from fossil sources, it has unique Environmental Credits assigned to it due to its origin from low- and negative-carbon, renewable sources. The Environmental Credits that we sell are composed of RINs and state low-carbon fuel credits, including CA LCFS credits, which are generated from the conversion of biogas to RNG that is used as a transportation fuel.
In addition to revenues generated from sales of RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel and Environmental Credits, we also generate revenues by providing O&M services for public and private RNG, natural gas and hydrogen vehicle fleet customer stations; selling and servicing compressors and other equipment used in RNG production and at RNG, natural gas and hydrogen stations; and obtaining federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives.
We are experts in the engineering, design and construction of fueling stations. When we build stations for customers, we charge construction, other fees, or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project. Since 2008, we have served as the general contractor or supervised qualified third-party contractors to build over 430 fueling stations. We use a combination of custom designed and off-the-shelf equipment to build fueling stations. 

● | Equipment for RNG stations consists of compressors, storage tanks, and dispensers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As operators deploy hydrogen-powered vehicles, we can modify our fueling stations and build additional stations to dispense clean hydrogen produced from our RNG. The equipment for hydrogen stations includes hydrogen reformers, compressors, storage tanks and dispensers, provided that the cost of adding hydrogen fueling may be significant. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We also have the capability to add high speed level 3 electric vehicle charging at our station sites, and our RNG can be used as a clean resource to power electric vehicles via on-site generation and/or routing to the electric grid serving our stations, provided that the cost of adding electric vehicle charging capacity may be significant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Customer Markets
We serve customers in a variety of markets, including trucking, airports, refuse and public transit. We believe these customer markets are well-suited for the adoption of RNG and other alternative vehicle fuels because they consume relatively high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are facing increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental requirements. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Trucking
We believe heavy-duty trucking represents the greatest opportunity for RNG and other alternatives to be used as a vehicle fuel. We estimate there are over 15 million heavy-duty trucks operating in the U.S. using over 22 billion gallons of diesel fuel each year. As of December 31, 2020, we provided our fuels to over 4,000 heavy-duty trucks. Because these high-mileage vehicles consume substantial amounts of fuel, operators can derive significant benefits from the carbon and GHG reductions associated with our vehicle fuels. We are focused on fueling more heavy-duty trucks, and many well-

known shippers, manufacturers, retailers and other truck fleet operators have started to use RNG fueled trucks to move their freight, including among others Amazon, Pepsi Frito-Lay, FedEx, Anheuser-Busch, USPS, UPS, Kroger, KeHe Distributors, Kenan Advantage Group, and Estes Express.
Zero Now
To help facilitate the transition of trucking fleets to our fuels, we have launched the Zero Now truck financing program, which is intended to increase the deployment of the commercially available RNG heavy-duty trucks in the U.S. The Zero Now program generally involves the following:

● | One or more truck leasing or finance companies lease or sell RNG heavy-duty trucks to vehicle fleets pursuant to lease or sale agreements with the fleet operators and with us, providing for periodic payments by the fleet operators of amounts equal to the payments that will be made for the lease or purchase of an equivalent truck that operates on diesel fuel, and providing for payment by us of the incremental cost of the RNG truck over and above the diesel-equivalent truck; and

● | The fleet operators participating in the program enter into fueling agreements with us, under which the operators agree to purchase from us, and we agree to supply, minimum monthly volumes of RNG at prices (which are lower than diesel prices per GGE) to operate the trucks leased or purchased in the program and allow us to recoup our payment of the incremental cost of the RNG trucks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have entered into the following agreements to implement the Zero Now program:

● | In January 2019, we entered into a term credit agreement with Société Générale (“SG”), as lender, under which we are permitted to draw, from time to time, through the beginning of January 2022, up to an aggregate of $100.0 million to satisfy our payment obligations for the incremental cost of RNG trucks under the truck lease or sale agreements described above; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In January 2019, we entered into a credit support agreement with Total Holdings USA Inc. (“THUSA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Total (which indirectly through another of its subsidiaries, holds approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock), pursuant to which THUSA has guaranteed our obligations under the term credit agreement with SG. In consideration for such guaranty, we have agreed to pay to THUSA a quarterly fee at a rate per annum equal to 10% of the average amount owed by us under the term credit agreement during the preceding quarter.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, we are supporting the growth of the RNG heavy-duty truck market through commodity swap arrangements under which we have locked in a discount price to diesel for customers fueling with us; our negotiation of favorable fuel tank pricing from manufacturers, which we are passing along to our customers; and our network of truck-friendly fueling stations (we refer to this network as “America’s Natural Gas Highway” or “ANGH”), which we have built in key locations nationwide. Many existing ANGH stations are located at Pilot Travel Centers, the largest truck fueling operator in the United States.
Chevron Adopt-a-Port Program
In 2020, we partnered with Chevron on Adopt-a-Port, an initiative that provides truck operators serving the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach with RNG to reduce emissions. For its part, Chevron provides funding for Adopt-a-Port and supplies RNG to Clean Energy stations near the ports. Chevron’s funding allows truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new RNG-powered trucks. We manage the program, including offering fueling services for qualified truck operators. Truck operators participating in the program, which supports the ports’ Clean Trucks Program and Clean Air Action Plan, fuel at our stations supplied with Chevron RNG. Importantly, Adopt-a-Port provides a meaningful air quality improvement for the adversely-impacted communities around the port – such communities typically have the worst air quality in the nation. As of December 31, 2020, customers had ordered 141 trucks under Adopt-a-Port, and we expect at least 310 additional trucks to be ordered in 2021.

Airports
We estimate that vehicles serving airports in the United States, including airport delivery fleets, rental car and parking passenger shuttles and taxis, consume an aggregate of approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. Additionally, many U.S. airports face emissions challenges and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce pollution, particularly as part of any expansion plans. As a result, many of these airports have adopted various strategies to address tailpipe emissions, including rental car and hotel shuttle consolidation and requiring or encouraging service vehicle operators to switch their fleets to our vehicle fuels. As of December 31, 2020, we serve customers at 32 airports.
Refuse
We believe that there are nearly 200,000 refuse trucks in the United States that collect and haul refuse and recyclables, which aggregately consume approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. We estimate that approximately 60% of new refuse trucks are capable of operating on RNG, up from approximately 3% of new refuse trucks in 2008. Refuse haulers are increasingly adopting trucks that run on our vehicle fuels to realize operational savings and to address demands for reduced emissions from the public, investors, and governmental agencies. As of December 31, 2020, we fuel approximately 14,000 refuse vehicles for customers including Waste Management, Republic Services, Waste Connections, GFL Environmental, Atlas Disposal, Burrtec, CR&R, Recology and Waste Pro, among others. We also provide vehicle fueling services to municipal refuse fleets.
Public Transit
We believe that there are over 71,000 municipal transit buses operating in the United States. In many areas, increasingly stringent emissions standards have limited the fueling options available to public transit operators. Also, transit agencies typically fuel at a central location and use high volumes of fuel. We estimate that transit agencies in the United States consume approximately one billion gallons of fuel per year. Many transit agencies have been early adopters of vehicles using our fuels, and over 25% of existing transit buses and approximately 35% of new transit buses can operate on RNG. As of December 31, 2020, we fuel over 9,000 transit vehicles for customers including Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, New York MTA, Foothill Transit (Los Angeles County, California), Orange County Transit Authority, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, Dallas Area Rapid Transit, Phoenix Transit, New Jersey Transit, Jacksonville Transportation Authority, NICE Bus (Nassau County, New York) and Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority.
Competition
There are many other companies operating in the renewable energy and waste-to-energy space. Regarding RNG production and supply, our primary competition is from other companies or solutions for access to biogas from waste. Evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics have a strong effect on the competitive landscape. We have demonstrated a track record of strategic flexibility across our history which has allowed us to pivot towards projects and markets that we believe deliver optimal returns and stockholder value in response to changes in market, regulatory and competitive pressures. The biogas and RNG markets are heavily fragmented. We believe we are in a strong position to compete for new project development and supply opportunities. Competition for such opportunities, however, including the prices being offered for fuel supply, impact profitability of opportunities to us, and may make opportunities unsuitable to pursue. 
The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. The biggest competition for RNG use as a vehicle fuel is gasoline and diesel because most vehicles in our key markets are powered by these fuels. Many established businesses are in the market for RNG and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuel, including alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers, utilities and their affiliates and other organizations. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, as well as producers and fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and fueling stations for other vehicle fuels. In addition, we transport and sell CNG through NG Advantage’s virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects and compete with other participants in this market.

If the alternative vehicle fuel market grows then the number and type of participants in this market and their level of capital and other commitments to alternative vehicle fuel programs we expect to increase. We compete for vehicle fuel users based on demand for the type of fuel, which may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, cost, supply, availability, quality, cleanliness, and safety of the fuel; cost, availability and reputation of vehicles and engines; convenience and accessibility of fueling stations; regulatory mandates and other requirements; and recognition of the brand. We believe we compare favorably with our competitors based on these factors; however, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products; adopt more aggressive pricing policies, dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities; implement more robust or creative initiatives to advance consumer acceptance of their products; or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the vehicle fuels market.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, the government procurement process, any political activities or lobbying in which we may engage, public reporting and taxation, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations, adoption of new regulations or failure by us to comply with applicable regulations may result in significant additional expense to us or our customers or a variety of administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Certain regulations that significantly affect our various operating activities are described below. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but new regulations or amendments to existing regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business, and these unknown costs and effects are not specifically contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates. 
We are subject to federal, state, and local air quality, solid waste, and water quality regulations and permitting requirements. Specific construction and operating permit requirements may differ among states. Specific permits we frequently must obtain include air permits, nonhazardous waste management permits, pollutant discharge elimination permits, and beneficial use permits. We must also maintain compliance with relevant federal, state and local environmental, health and safety requirements.
RNG projects are subject to federal RFS program regulations. The EPA administers the RFS program with volume requirements for several categories of renewable fuels. The EPA’s RFS regulations establish rules for fuel supplied and administer the RIN system for compliance, trading credits and rules for waivers. The EPA calculates a blending standard for each year based on estimates of gasoline usage from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency. Separate quotas and blending requirements are determined for cellulosic biofuels, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuels, and total renewable fuel. Further, we are required to register each RNG project with the EPA and relevant state regulatory agencies. We qualify our RINs through a voluntary Quality Assurance Plan, which typically takes from three to five months from first injection of RNG into the commercial pipeline system. Further, we may make a large project investment prior to receiving the regulatory approval and RIN qualification. In addition to registering each RNG project, we are subject to quarterly audits under the Quality Assurance Plan of our projects to validate our qualification.
Our operations are also subject to state renewable fuel standard regulations. The CA LCFS program requires producers of petroleum-based fuels to reduce the CI of their products, beginning with a quarter of a percent in 2011 a 10% total reduction by 2020, and a 20% total reduction by 2030. Petroleum importers, refiners and wholesalers can either develop their own low-carbon fuel products or buy CA LCFS credits from other companies that develop and sell low-carbon alternative fuels, such as biofuels, electricity, natural gas, or hydrogen. We are subject to a qualification process like that for RINs, including verification of CI levels and other requirements, existing for CA LCFS credits.

Before an RNG project can be developed, all Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Subtitle D requirements (requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management) must be satisfied. In particular, because methane is explosive in certain concentrations and poses a hazard if it migrates, biogas collection systems must meet RCRA Subtitle D standards for gas control. RNG projects may be subject to other federal, state and local regulations that impose requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management.
Certain of our operations may be subject to federal requirements to prepare for and respond to spills or releases from tanks and other equipment and provide training on operation, maintenance and discharge prevention procedures and the applicable pollution control laws. We may be required to develop spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans to memorialize our preparation and response plans and to update them on a regular basis.
Our operations may result in liability for hazardous substances or other materials placed into soil or groundwater. Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or other federal, state, or local laws governing the investigation and cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous substances, we may be required to investigate and/or remediate soil and groundwater contamination at our projects, contiguous and adjacent properties and other properties owned and/or operated by third parties.
Additionally, biogas projects may need to obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits if wastewater is discharged directly to a receiving water body. If wastewater is discharged to a local sewer system, biogas projects may need to obtain an industrial wastewater permit from a local regulatory authority for discharges to a Publicly Owned Treatment Works. The authority to issue these permits may be delegated to state or local governments by the EPA. The permits, which typically last five years, limit the quantity and concentration of pollutants that may be discharged. Permits may require wastewater treatment or impose other operating conditions to ensure compliance with the limits. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
On September 23, 2020, the California Governor issued an Executive Order N-79-20 setting goals for expanding the sale and use of zero-emission vehicles within California, including 100% of in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks to be zero-emission by 2035, and 100% of medium- and heavy-duty truck vehicles in California to be zero-emission by 2045 for all operations where feasible. The Governor also directed CARB to develop and propose regulations to achieve these goals consistent with state and federal law. This order is the latest in a series of targets set by California to transform the energy and transportation fuel sectors and reduce GHG emissions. Executive Order B55-18 sets a statewide target to achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2045. The transitioning of California’s energy markets to increased reliance on renewable and carbon-free sources has the potential to create favorable market conditions for RNG but could also harm our vehicle fueling business. Future regulatory actions will be required to meet the state’s zero-emission and carbon neutrality targets.
Employees and our Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 465 people. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements.
The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain talented individuals at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have developed and maintain key recruitment and retention strategies. These include competitive salary structures, including bonus compensation programs, and competitive benefits policies, including paid time off for vacations, sick leave and holidays, short-term disability coverage, group term life insurance, and various retirement savings and incentive plans.
Safety of our personnel is a core value of Clean Energy and maintaining a safe work environment is critical to an energy company’s ability to attract and retain employees. To support the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enhanced our safety protocols to promote social distancing, implemented more extensive cleaning and sanitation processes, incorporated temperature checks, required facial covering, instituted employee questionnaires, restricted corporate travel and visitor access to facilities, and implemented work-from-home and work-flex initiatives for certain employees.

Sales and Marketing
We market our brands, products and services primarily through our direct sales force, which includes sales representatives covering all of our major geographic and customer markets, as well as attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events. Our sales and marketing team also works closely with federal, state and local government agencies to provide education about the value of our vehicle fuels and to keep abreast of proposed and newly adopted regulations that affect our industry.
Seasonality
To some extent, our business may experience seasonality. For more information, see the discussion under “Seasonality and Inflation” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights primarily consist of trade secrets, know-how and trademarks, and we rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secret laws, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect these rights and our proprietary information. These intellectual property rights help us to retain existing business and secure new relationships with customers.
