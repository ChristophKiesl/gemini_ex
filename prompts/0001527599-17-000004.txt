ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company that has historically focused on microRNA-based oncology therapeutics, which are short ribonucleic acid, or RNA, molecules, or oligonucleotides. 
Our first product candidate, MRX34, a mimic of naturally occurring microRNA 34 (miR 34) encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation, was studied as a single agent in a Phase 1 clinical trial. In September 2016, we voluntarily halted the Phase 1 trial following multiple immune-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, observed in patients dosed with MRX34 in the trial. Subsequently, we received notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, that the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for MRX34 is on full clinical hold. Following our suspension of the Phase 1 trial for MRX34 and the FDA’s clinical hold on the IND for MRX34, we discontinued development of MRX34 and our microRNA product pipeline. 
In November 2016, we discontinued research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate our strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. We also initiated a plan in November 2016 to reduce personnel and expenses to preserve capital and further streamline our operations consistent with our decision to discontinue development of MRX34 and our microRNA product pipeline. We expect to devote significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in any agreements or transactions that will enhance shareholder value. Further, any strategic transaction that is completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value.
We were incorporated in 2007 under the laws of Delaware and were maintained as a wholly‑owned subsidiary of our former parent company, Asuragen, Inc., or Asuragen, until the end of 2009, when we became an independent entity.
Our Strategy
Our corporate strategy currently is focused on pursuing strategic initiatives to enhance stockholder value. We have implemented operating cost reductions, organizational restructuring, including a recent reduction in our workforce, to reduce overall cash burn and facilitate our pursuit of strategic initiatives. We have engaged a financial and strategic advisor to explore a range of alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including but not limited to a merger or the sale of the Company. Our strategic process is both active and ongoing and includes a range of interactions with transaction counterparties. Thus, we believe it is in our stockholders’ best interest to allow sufficient opportunity to pursue and consummate one or more such transactions and to consider additional alternatives that may materialize in the future before making a decision regarding a liquidation of the Company.
Our Historical microRNA Platform
More than 10 years ago, while working at Ambion®, our scientists discovered through extensive microRNA expression and functional assay work that microRNAs are expressed differently in cancer tissue compared to normal adjacent tissue and that several naturally occurring microRNAs function as tumor suppressors by regulating the expression of key oncogenes and preventing the development, progression and dissemination of cancer.
To enable therapeutic application of these tumor suppressor microRNAs, we pioneered technologies for creating RNA molecules that function as natural microRNAs when they enter human cells. These RNA molecules, which we call microRNA mimics, may be used to replace those tumor suppressor microRNAs that are lost, or under-expressed, in cancer cells. We pioneered the development of therapeutic miRNA mimics that feature two complementary RNA strands that are hybridized to produce a double-stranded RNA. The active strand has a sequence that is identical to a microRNA normally expressed in a cell, while the second, passenger strand is modified to facilitate proper loading of the active strand onto the cytoplasmic protein complex necessary for microRNA function inside the cells. While similar in structure, microRNA mimics are clearly differentiated from small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through their biological heritage and activity. In contrast to the man-made sequences of siRNAs that target a single gene, microRNA mimics function like naturally occurring microRNAs to orchestrate the expression of many different genes to enable normal cell development and function. We believe our microRNA mimics have the mechanistic flexibility to be used as:

• | first-line agents in combination with current standards of care, including targeted therapies, immuno-oncology therapies, chemotherapies and/or radiation therapies;


• | monotherapies in advanced or refractory patient settings;

2


• | monotherapies in patients who would be intolerant of current standards of care; and


• | monotherapies in tumor settings that do not have any approved therapies.

Delivery of microRNA Mimics to Target Tissues
Systemic delivery of oligonucleotides, including microRNAs, has been a major challenge, principally due to the fact that after intravenous administration these molecules have to overcome multiple barriers before reaching their ultimate place of action, which is the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm of cells. 
We have evaluated a wide variety of proprietary delivery systems with our microRNA compounds for in vivo and ex vivo testing. Based on this testing, we previously selected SMARTICLES® formulation technology, licensed from Marina Biotech, Inc. as the delivery technology for miR‑34. miR-34 was the target tumor suppressor microRNA of our first product candidate MRX34. In September 2016, the FDA placed the IND for MRX34 on full clinical hold and we have discontinued development of MRX34 and our microRNA product pipeline.
Product Pipeline
In November 2016, we discontinued research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate our strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. Prior to discontinuing our research and development activities, we were developing a pipeline of tumor suppressor microRNA mimics. Each microRNA mimic in our pipeline was designed to replicate the activity of a single tumor suppressor miRNA and regulate the expression of key oncogenes across multiple oncogenic pathways. We were granted therapeutic use patent claims related to several tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as composition of matter claims for multiple chemistries and structures. 
Through execution of our in silico, in vitro and in vivo analysis of multiple tumor suppressor microRNAs we previously prioritized a pipeline of candidate molecules for further validation toward clinical candidate nomination. Before we discontinued our research and development activities in November 2016, each of these candidates was previously studied for therapeutic potential in specific cancer indications, as set forth in the table below:

MicroRNAPROGRAM | KEY ONCOGENE TARGETS | PATHWAYS | CANCER INDICATION 
miR-215 | BCL2, BMI1, DHFR, IGF, IGFR1, MDM2, PIM1, WNK1, XIAP, ZEB1/2 | Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, DNA Repair, EMT | Esophageal, Kidney, Multiple Myeloma 
miR-101 | MYCN, EZH2, ERK2, FOS, MCL1, COX2, DNMT3A, VEGF, MET, ZEB1/2 | Angiogenesis, Cell Cycle, Apoptosis, EMT, Inflammation | Bladder, Gastric, Lung, Ovarian 
miR-16 | BCL2, VEGF-A, Cyclin-D1, HMGA1, FGFR1, CDK6, BMI1 | Apoptosis, Autophagy, Angiogenesis, EMT, Cell Cycle | Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Lymphoma
let-7 | RAS, MYC, HMGA2, TGFBR1,MYCN, Cyclin D2, IL6, ITGB3 | Cell Cycle, Angiogenesis, Cancer Stem Cell, EMT | Prostate, Pancreatic, Melanoma 

MRX34
MRX34 is a double‑stranded RNA mimic of the tumor suppressor microRNA, miR‑34, encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation called SMARTICLES. Based on preclinical data and a potential new mechanism for the treatment of cancer, we opened IND applications in the United States and Korea and initiated our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial, titled MRX34-101. However, in September 2016, we voluntarily halted the Phase 1 trial following multiple immune-related SAEs observed in patients dosed with MRX34 over the course of the trial. Three of these immune-related events resulted in the patient’s death. Subsequently, we received notification from the FDA that the IND for MRX34 is on full clinical hold. Following our suspension of the Phase 1 trial for MRX34 and the FDA’s clinical hold on the IND for MRX34, we discontinued development of MRX34 and our microRNA product pipeline.
Intellectual Property
We have previously worked to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believed were important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and 
3

any other inventions important to the development of our business. We have also relied on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our Patent Portfolio
We own or in-license a portfolio of patents and patent applications that has protected various aspects of our business. The patents and patent applications that make up our patent portfolio have been primarily focused on various aspects of microRNA therapeutics. As of December 31, 2016, we own or in-licensed over 10 issued U.S. patents and over 42 pending U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications. The expiration dates of the currently issued patents range from 2025 to 2032. We also have multiple pending patent applications that, if issued, will expire between 2025 and 2035.
Patent Term
The term of individual patents and patent applications in our portfolio will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or parent application, if applicable). For example, if an international Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application is filed, any patent issuing from the PCT application in a specific country expires 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application. In the United States, however, if a patent was in force on June 8, 1995, or issued on an application that was filed before June 8, 1995, that patent will generally have a term that is the greater of twenty years from the filing date or 17 years from the date of issue.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the owner of a patent to apply for a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of an NDA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use, or to work with our licensors, as owners of such patents, to obtain such extensions, if available.
Strategic Partnerships and Licenses
CPRIT
In August 2010, we entered into a grant contract with the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), under which we received a $10.3 million commercialization award from the State of Texas through CPRIT. CPRIT was established to expedite innovation and commercialization in the area of cancer research and to enhance access to evidence-based prevention programs and services throughout the State of Texas. The award was a three-year award that was funded annually, and the contract terminated on January 31, 2014, subject to our obligations to make certain payments that survive termination. Under the terms of the award, we will be required to pay to CPRIT a portion of our revenues from sales of certain products by us, or received from our licensees or sublicensees, at a percentage in the low single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals a specified multiple of the grant amount, and thereafter at a rate of less than one percent, subject to our right, under certain circumstances, to make a one-time payment in a specified amount to CPRIT to buy out such payment obligations. The 2010 grant contract also contains a provision that provides for repayment to CPRIT some amount not to exceed the full amount of the grant proceeds under certain specified circumstances involving relocation of our principal place of business outside Texas.
On September 1, 2015, we entered into a new grant contract with CPRIT in connection with an approximately $16.8 million award, subject to extension by mutual agreement by us and CPRIT. In October 2015, concurrent with our IPO, we realized this 2015 award in the form of an agreement by CPRIT to purchase approximately $16.8 million of shares of our common stock in a private placement. In contrast to our 2010 award, this 2015 award does not include any royalty obligation upon commercialization of our product candidates, nor are we required to repay the grant proceeds under specified circumstances. Pursuant to this grant contract, we will conduct preclinical and clinical development of certain combination therapy approaches for lung or liver cancer involving MRX34. If, at any time during the term of the grant contract, we determine that the project provided for by the grant 
4

contract is no longer commercially feasible for us, then we and CPRIT are required to consult in order to reallocate the remaining unspent budget for the project to another oncology project in our product candidate pipeline. 
Manufacturing
In November 2016, we discontinued further research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate our strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution or testing and we have previously contracted with third parties to manufacture our compounds for nonclinical and clinical testing purposes. 
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. If we resume research and development activities, our systems and contractors would be required to be in compliance with these regulations.
Drug Substance
Following our suspension of the Phase 1 trial for MRX34 and the FDA’s clinical hold on the IND for MRX34, we discontinued development of MRX34 and our microRNA product pipeline; however, we previously used NITTO DENKO Avecia, or Avecia, to manufacture our MRX34 drug substance. 
Drug Product
Our drug product for our microRNA mimics consists of the drug substance formulated in the SMARTICLES liposomal delivery system. The drug product was provided as a concentrated, frozen aqueous solution that was defrosted, thawed and diluted for infusion in the clinic. The exclusive manufacturer of drug product for MRX34 was Polymun; however, this product candidate has been discontinued and we have disposed of all of our finished product that was outstanding. 
Research and Development
In November 2016, we discontinued our research and development activities to reduce operating expenses while we evaluate our strategic alternatives with a goal to enhance stockholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of the Company. Before we discontinued our research and development activities, we conducted clinical trials and other development activities to support the development of our product candidates. In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $13.9 million, $18.9 million, and $10.5 million, respectively, of research and development expense.
Before we discontinued our research and development activities, our research programs were directed towards the following:

• | Determining if biomarkers can be used to select cancer patients who are more likely to respond to MRX34 therapy.


• | Selecting and developing a second miRNA‑based therapeutic candidate.


• | Developing a next‑generation systemic delivery technology that will improve the tolerability and efficacy profiles of miRNA mimics and expand the cancer indications that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. If we commence research and development activities, we would face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better‑funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to 
5

comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, clinical holds, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, nonclinical animal studies and formulation studies many of which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or cGLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP), regulations;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.

The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and, if we resume our research and development activities, we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, a submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy cGCP requirements, including the requirement to obtain effective informed consent from study subjects.
All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.
Clinical Trials
For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
6


• | Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 


• | Phase 2: Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications in patients with the disease or condition under study. 


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. 


• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post-approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
New Drug Applications
The results of nonclinical studies and of the clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use.
Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within 10 months of the filing date for standard review, but this timeframe is also often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGCP requirements is satisfactory.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts its inspections, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries 
7

and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may conditionally approve the NDA, among other things, requiring changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods after approval to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Nonclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. 
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are potential eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. Based on results of clinical studies submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into 
8

account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. However, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. We have not sought or obtained orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates. 
Employees
As of March 3, 2017, we had 9 full‑time employees, of whom two have medical degrees and one has a Ph.D. degree. These employees are primarily engaged in assisting the Company with the evaluation of strategic alternatives following the closure of the Company's Phase 1 trial of MRX34, as well as finance, human resources and general management functions necessary to operate as a public company. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
About Us
We were incorporated in late 2007 under the laws of Delaware and were maintained as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our former parent company, Asuragen, Inc., until the end of 2009 when we became an independent entity.
