 Item 1. Business
INTRODUCTION 
 SunOpta, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, is a leading global company operating businesses focused on a healthy products portfolio that promotes sustainable well-being. We are focused on sourcing non-genetically modified (non-GMO) and organic ingredients, and manufacturing healthy food and beverage products. We operate an integrated field-to-table business model leveraging our global ingredient sourcing platform to process and market non-GMO and organic ingredients for retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice operators. We manufacture packaged products focused on the high growth healthy beverages, healthy fruit and healthy snacks categories for our retail, foodservice and branded food customers. We believe we are a North American market leader in non-dairy organic aseptic beverages, premium refrigerated private label orange juice, individually quick frozen (IQF) organic fruit, healthy premium fruit snacks, and the global sourcing and supply of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients. Our scalable global sourcing platform makes us one of the leading suppliers of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients in the food industry, and provides us leading insights into emerging food and beverage trends. Our product portfolio is strategically aligned with the fast-growing consumer demand for high quality, healthy non-GMO and organic food and beverage products.
 Our vertically integrated business model makes us a preferred partner to our retail (e.g., grocery, mass, club, natural and specialty chains), foodservice and branded food customers. We deliver a diverse, innovative portfolio of high quality, food and beverage products supported by our global sourcing platform, scalable operating footprint, manufacturing expertise and commitment to innovation. This platform enables us to consistently supply our customers with a broad range of non-GMO and organic ingredients as well as high quality healthy food and beverage products that cater to the evolving demands of todays consumers. As a leading supplier of non-GMO and organic ingredients to the food industry, we leverage our insights into emerging consumer tastes and preferences to develop innovative new food and beverage products. 
 Our Product Portfolio
 Our diverse consumer products portfolio utilizes non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients that are sourced primarily by our vertically integrated global ingredients capabilities, and consists of three main commercial platforms:


Healthy Beverages  We offer a full line of
 aseptic beverages, including non-dairy beverages (e.g., soy, almond,
 coconut, rice and others), nutritional beverages, dairy beverages, broths
 and teas. We also offer refrigerated premium juices, shelf-stable juices
 and functional waters. We believe we are the leading North American
 provider of non-dairy organic aseptic beverages and premium
 refrigerated private label organic orange juice. 


Healthy Fruit  We offer IQF fruit for retail
 (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, mango, pineapple, blends and other
 berries and fruit), IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice (e.g.,
 purées, fruit cups and smoothies), and custom fruit preparations for
 industrial use. We believe we are the leading North American
 provider of private label non-GMO and organic IQF fruit. 


Healthy Snacks  We offer fruit snacks (including
 bars, twists, ropes and bite-sized varieties), roasted snacks, nutritional
 bars, and re-sealable pouch products (e.g., baby food, puddings, sauces
 and other healthy snacks). We believe we are a leading North American
 provider of premium healthy fruit snacks. 


 Our global ingredients platform is focused on the procurement and sale of non-GMO and organic grains and seeds (including ancient grains and seeds), fruits, vegetables, sweeteners, coffees, nuts and other products as ingredients in both raw material and processed ingredient forms. In addition to supplying our own healthy food and beverage product portfolio, we are a leading supplier of raw materials and processed ingredients to a number of global food manufacturers and foodservice operators. Our vertically integrated model allows us to leverage our scalable and diverse supply of high quality non-GMO and organic ingredients, adding value to a product at multiple stages of the supply chain and delivering comprehensive non-GMO and organic food ingredients and packaged goods solutions to our customers evolving demands. This model allows us to provide our global ingredients customers with high quality healthy food and beverage products.
 Using our vertically integrated business model, we process non-GMO and organic food ingredients into consumer packaged products, primarily healthy beverages, healthy fruit and healthy snacks. Our food ingredients are converted from raw materials, and our raw materials are sourced from approximately 5,000 suppliers encompassing approximately 10,000 growers in over 65 countries. Our employees and assets, which include 24 processing and packaging facilities, are principally located in North America and Europe with smaller sourcing and processing operations in Africa and China. Our operations and capabilities provide the flexibility to modify our product portfolio to adapt to the changing consumer needs for non-GMO and organic food and beverage products. As a general principle, we do not own or operate our own farms, retail stores, or extensively market our own consumer brands.

Our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation drives our ability to introduce new higher margin food and beverage products to the market. In June 2015, we expanded our research and development platform by opening an advanced innovation center in Edina, Minnesota. This facility supports our dedicated team of food scientists, engineers and technicians, expands our product development capabilities, increases our speed to market and enables us to proactively engage customers in creating and developing new products. Our innovation platform supports our leadership position in non-GMO and organic food and strengthens our relationships with our retail, foodservice and contract manufacturing customers. 
 Value Creation Plan  On June 27, 2016, we announced that we had engaged external financial and legal advisors to review our operating plan and to evaluate a range of strategic and financial actions that we could undertake to maximize shareholder value. The strategic review arose out of discussions with our largest shareholders, some of which had advocated that we examine value maximization strategies. We also announced that we had engaged a global executive search firm to assist in identifying candidates who could add additional operating, industry and capital markets experience and expertise to our Board of Directors (the Board). The strategic review was concluded on October 7, 2016 with our announcement of a strategic partnership with Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, Oaktree).

 We are conducting, with the assistance of Oaktree, a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Through this review, management and the Board have developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The statements we make below about the expected results of the Value Creation Plan, including expected improvements in earnings, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), working capital efficiencies, and expected cash flows, are forward-looking statements. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses when assessing the performance of our operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including debt service and capital expenditures.

 We are currently targeting implementation of $30 million of productivity-driven annualized EBITDA enhancements and $20 million of working capital efficiencies, to be implemented over the coming 12 to 18 months. In the near-term, these benefits are expected to be offset by structural investments we are making in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources. Additionally, during 2017 we anticipate incurring non-structural third-party consulting support, severance, and recruiting costs. The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies. Over time, we expect these investments to yield additional improvement in EBITDA beyond the $30 million of initial productivity-driven savings. Recent progress on each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan is highlighted below. 

 Portfolio Optimization
 The focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where we are not effectively positioned. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced the closing of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility, which is expected to be $4 million accretive to EBITDA in 2017. Following that initial announcement, we continued to evaluate our portfolio which resulted in the following additional actions:


Closure of our soy extraction (ingredient) facility in
Heuvelton, New York, transferring production to our Alexandria, Minnesota
facility.



Exited certain varieties of specialty soy and sunflower, as
well as frozen edamame.


Exited a non-core vegetable brokerage operation.


Launched a global organic ingredients portfolio strategy
review, which is identifying incremental large ingredient categories for further
investment. The incremental growth opportunities include new geographies, new
products and new processing capabilities.


 During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1.2 million associated with the Heuvelton facility closure, and $3.4 million of inventory and other reserves to reflect the exit of non-core business lines. We intend to continue to proactively manage our business portfolio to identify opportunities to drive EBITDA growth.

Operational Excellence
 The focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food quality and safety, coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency. These efforts are expected to generate productivity improvements in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. With the assistance of third-party consulting support, we have identified a number of broad-based savings opportunities to be implemented and realized over 2017 and 2018. Recent activities include:


Launched network-wide upgrades to worker safety and food quality programs,
with the goal of becoming the leader in safety and quality across the healthy
food industry.


Launched a productivity enhancement program that is systematically evaluating
all manufacturing facilities, supply chain, and procurement processes to
identify productivity cost savings. As a result of these efforts, we are
targeting $30 million in annualized EBITDA improvements to be implemented over
the next 12 to 18 months.


Rolled out the SunOpta Plant Management System, which consists of a
standardized set of operating processes, key performance indicators, and
continuous improvement methodologies that will provide improved consistency and
productivity performance across the manufacturing network.


Launched a working capital optimization program that is targeting $20 million
of cash flow enhancements.


 Go-to-Market Effectiveness 
The focus of the go-to-market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels, and identify and penetrate new high-potential sales channels. We expect efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time. Early in 2017, we re-aligned our go-to-market approach, hiring key talent to lead foodservice and retail sales, as well as adding new marketing resources. We also launched a sales force effectiveness program that has already started to generate results. Recent highlights include:
 

Hired a new Senior Vice President of Foodservice Sales and a Senior Vice
President of Beverages and Snacks.


Secured new business wins in Healthy Beverage, Healthy Fruit and Global
Ingredients.


Selectively adjusted pricing to enhance margins.


Process Sustainability
 The focus of process sustainability is to ensure we have the infrastructure, systems and skills to sustain the business improvements and value captured from the Value Creation Plan. In February 2017, we executed an organizational redesign focused on streamlining and simplifying the business, investing in systems and processes to ensure each function has the tools in place to achieve our goals. Recent initiatives include:


Developed a plan to increase capital engineering, plant engineering, and
process engineering capabilities that is targeted to enhance food safety,
product flow and productivity performance.


Created a centralized Consumer Products supply chain team to manage sales and
operations planning (S&OP), warehousing and distribution.


Launched a comprehensive S&OP program to improve supply/demand planning, which
is expected to reduce inventory while improving customer service.


Initiated a program to push centralized cost accounting resources into
manufacturing facilities to improve the accuracy of manufacturing-related
financial data.

Governance and Management Transitions 
 Chief Executive Officer 
 Effective February 6, 2017, David Colo was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SunOpta. In conjunction with this appointment, Mr. Colo also became a member of the Board. Mr. Colo joined SunOpta from Diamond Foods, Inc. where he served as Executive Vice-President, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Colo has 30 years of leadership experience in general management, operations and supply chain management. As Executive Vice-President, Chief Operating Officer for Diamond Foods, Mr. Colo had direct responsibility for marketing, innovation, research and development, operations, supply chain, procurement, quality, food safety, grower services and contract manufacturing.
 On November 11, 2016, Hendrik Jacobs resigned from his positions as President, CEO, and director. Director Katrina Houde served as interim CEO prior to the appointment of Mr. Colo. Ms. Houde will continue her position on the Board following Mr. Colos appointment. 
 Board of Directors 
 On October 7, 2016, we increased the size of the Board to nine directors and appointed two Oaktree-nominated independent directors, Dean Hollis and Al Bolles, Ph.D., to the Board. Mr. Hollis is Chairman of the Board of AdvancePierre Foods and the former President and Chief Operating Officer of the Consumer Foods Division of ConAgra Foods and former Chairman of Boulder Brands. Mr. Bolles most recently served as Executive Vice President, Chief Technology & Operations Officer of ConAgra Foods. Also on October 7, 2016, Brendan Springstubb was appointed to the Board to replace Douglas Greene who resigned as a director. Mr. Springstubb is a Principal at Engaged Capital LLC (Engaged), one of our largest shareholders.
 On October 9, 2016, Alan Murray stepped down from the Board and was replaced as Chair of the Board by Mr. Hollis.
 On January 19, 2017, Gregg Tanner was appointed to the Board to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of director Jay Amato. Most recently, Mr. Tanner served as CEO and director for Dean Foods Company from October 2012 to December 2016.
 Business Development 
 Issuance of Series A Preferred Stock
 On October 7, 2016, Oaktree invested $85.0 million in cumulative, non-participating Series A Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. (SunOpta Foods). The shares of Preferred Stock are exchangeable into common shares of SunOpta Inc. in accordance with certain terms and conditions. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock were used to repay $79.0 million of outstanding debt.
 In connection with the Preferred Stock offering, we issued 11.3 million Special Shares, Series 1 (the Special Voting Shares) of the Company to Oaktree, which entitle Oaktree to one vote per Special Voting Share on all matters submitted to a vote of our common shareholders. As of the date of issuance, the Special Voting Shares represented an 11.7% voting interest in the Company. 
 Rationalization of Soy and Juice Operations 
 On December 27, 2016, the Board approved closure of our soy facility in Heuvelton, New York. We determined that our ingredients processing facility in Alexandria, Minnesota, could absorb the production volume from the Heuvelton facility, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers.
 On November 8, 2016, the Board approved the closure of our San Bernardino, California juice facility, after determining that it would be more beneficial to transfer our juice production from the facility to contract manufacturers with whom we have ongoing relationships, rather than make further capital investments in support of the bottling or extraction areas of the facility. These capital investments would have been necessary to satisfy packaging format changes demanded by the facilitys largest customer and to address shortfalls in contracting sufficient supply of raw citrus fruit for the upcoming season to allow for effective and efficient use of the facilitys extraction capabilities.

Sale of Opta Minerals 
 On February 11, 2016, Opta Minerals Inc. (Opta Minerals) entered into a definitive acquisition agreement, pursuant to which an affiliate of Speyside Equity Fund I LP (Speyside) agreed to acquire substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Opta Minerals. The acquisition of Opta Minerals by Speyside was completed on April 6, 2016, following a vote of the shareholders of Opta Minerals in favor of the transaction on March 31, 2016.
 Upon closing of the transaction, we received aggregate gross proceeds of $4.8 million (C$6.2 million). The sale of our equity interest in Opta Minerals was consistent with our objective of divesting our non-core assets in order to become a pure-play healthy and organic foods company. We have no significant continuing involvement with Opta Minerals. 
 Five-Year Global Revolving Asset-Based Credit Facility 
 On February 11, 2016, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the Global Credit Facility) in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $350 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. The Global Credit Facility supports the working capital and general corporate needs of our global operations, in addition to funding strategic initiatives. Subject to meeting certain conditions, we may request to increase the total lending commitments under the Global Credit Facility to a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $450 million. 
Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc. 
 On October 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc. (Sunrise), pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated July 30, 2015 (the Sunrise Acquisition), for total consideration of $472.7 million in cash. Sunrise is a processor of conventional and organic IQF fruit in the U.S. The acquisition of Sunrise aligned with our strategic focus on healthy and organic foods. Sunrise has been included in the Consumer Products operating segment since the date of acquisition.
 In January 2016, we initiated the consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition. Consequently, we transferred all production volume from our Buena Park, California facility into Sunrises facilities located in Kansas and California.

 Global Ingredients 
 Operations and Product offeringsGlobal Ingredients
Global Ingredients aggregates our North American and international raw material sourcing and supply operating segments focused on the procurement, processing and sale of specialty and organic grains, seeds, fruits, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other commodities, which are used primarily in applications serving the natural and organic food industry. Its operations are centered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Edina, Minnesota; and Scotts Valley, California. 
 Global Ingredients sources products from approximately 65 countries around the world, which include: 
 

Organic fruit- and vegetable-based raw materials and
 ingredients, sweeteners, cocoa, coffees, ancient grains, nuts, seeds and
 pulses and other organic food products. 


Identity preserved (IP), non-GMO and organic seeds and
 grains including soy, corn and sunflower for food applications, with
 control maintained at every stage of production, from seed selection and
 growing through storage, processing and transportation. 


Seed- and grain-based animal feed and pet food products
 that originate from select organic and non-GMO soy, corn, sunflower and
 other commodities. 


 Global Ingredients also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services that include: 
 

Seed and grain conditioning services for soy,
 corn and sunflower.

SUNOPTA INC. | 10 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


Coffee and sesame seed processing.

Dry and oil roasting and packaging, including in-shell
 sunflower and sunflower kernels, corn, soy- and legume- based snacks. 
Liquid (concentrates and oil) and dried format seed,
 grain and cocoa based ingredients utilizing non-GMO and organic soy, corn,
 sunflower, rice, and cocoa. 
Specialty organic functional ingredients, including
 maltodextrins, tack blends, flavor enhancing products, including snack
 coatings, cheese powders and flavor systems. 


 CompetitionGlobal Ingredients 
 Food ingredients are considered unique niche items often sourced, developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. Global Ingredients competes with large seed, grain, raw material and specialty ingredient suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active on the international commercial seed, grain and raw material procurement market for supply. Its non-GMO and organic specialty products compete in the smaller niche commercial non-GMO and organic seed, grain and raw material markets. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with producers. Competitors include major food companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources, as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than our own. 
 The international organic food industry is very competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. Global Ingredients competes with worldwide brokers, traders and food processors for the limited supply of organic raw material ingredients. In many cases, it will enter into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of its supply chain.
Distribution, Marketing, and SalesGlobal Ingredients
 As a leading provider of IP, non-GMO and organic, grains, seeds, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other raw materials, Global Ingredients has well established sales and marketing capabilities, including technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and/or sales regions. Its specialty grains, seeds and other raw materials and ingredients are sold to food manufacturers and producers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer-packaged food companies. In addition, in our estimation, it maintains one of the largest organic raw material ingredient sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to develop and manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs. It also provides procurement and ingredient processing support to the Consumer Products operating segment.
 SuppliersGlobal Ingredients 
 Global Ingredients has an extensive established IP, organic soy, corn and sunflower grower network in North America, with many relationships existing for over 25 years. It also has a network of growers in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of raw materials in a specific geography, it continues to focus on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, it also has the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return.
 Organic raw material ingredient suppliers include growers, processors and traders of organic fruit- and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. The diversity of our supplier base helps to ensure continual supply by providing contra-seasonal solutions to mitigate crop and quality risks. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program, European Union (EU) standards, or others.

Consumer Products 
 Operations and Product OfferingsConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products provides healthy and organic food products that are primarily consumer-packaged to retailers, foodservice distributors and major global food manufacturers with a variety of branded and private label products. Consumer Products packaged food products are categorized into the following three main commercial platforms: 


Healthy Beverages 


Aseptic beverages including soy, almond, rice, coconut,
 sunflower and other non-dairy and alternative beverages, as well as
 adjacent categories such as organic dairy and nutritional beverages,
 including milk, broths and teas. Specializing in aseptic product
 offerings, Consumer Products produces a variety of pack sizes, including
 multi-serve and single-serve formats, all shelf stable with long shelf
 lives.


Organic and conventional beverage products, including
 shelf stable and refrigerated juices; specialty beverages; vitamin and
 electrolyte waters; and energy drinks. Consumer Products partners with
 third-party fillers to provide extended shelf life refrigerated packaging
 formats to its customers. 

Our Healthy Beverage platform operates from an east to
 west network of three facilities, as well as co- manufacturing
 relationships that allow us to minimize distribution costs for our
 customers, maintain redundant back-up plans, and offer reliable,
 year-round programs. 

Healthy Fruit 


IQF natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables,
 including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, peppers, broccoli,
 blends and many other items. Consumer Products produces a variety of
 packaging formats, including tubs, stand-up pouches, cups and polybags to
 address the needs of its retail and foodservice customers.


Specialty fruit toppings and bases, which are custom
 formulated to provide unique flavor and texture profiles for a wide range
 of specialized applications. Applications include fruit bases for yogurts,
 ice creams, cheeses, smoothies, shakes, frozen desserts, bakery fillings,
 health bars, various beverages, dressings, marinades, dips and sauces, and
 fruit toppings for foodservice applications. 

Our Healthy Fruit platform operates from five facilities
 that extend from central Mexico through to California, as well as a
 production facility in Kansas. Strategically our north to south footprint
 on the west coast allows us to maximize access to supply of fruit over the
 course of the full growing season, while our operation in the Midwest
 serves as a lower-cost launching pad to deliver product to the east coast. 
Healthy Snacks



Organic and conventional re-sealable pouch products, in a
 variety of pack sizes and shapes, containing a variety of products
 including baby food, puddings, sauces, and healthy fruit-, vegetable- and
 protein-based snacks serving the adult nutrition category.


Nutritious snacks including natural and organic
 fruit-based snacks in bar, twist, rope and bite size shapes, with the
 ability to add a variety of ingredients; and baked and extruded nutrition
 (i.e., protein, energy and meal replacement) bars using a wide variety of
 ingredients including grains, proteins and other ingredients. 

Our Healthy Snack platform operates from an east to west
 network of four facilities, as well as co- manufacturing relationships. In
 the case of fruit snacks, we maintain bi-coastal production which helps to
 minimize delivery costs to our customers. 

 CompetitionConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products healthy beverage and health snacks offerings compete with major food manufacturing companies, as well as a number of other regional manufacturers. Its healthy fruit offerings face competition from both branded and private label fruit providers. It faces competition when securing seed, grain, fruit, vegetable and dairy raw materials; however, due to the location of its processing facilities, it is able to source these raw materials from a number of growing regions and suppliers. Integrated sourcing through Global Ingredients, which supplies a number of core raw materials, combined with in-house processing and packaging capabilities, provides Consumer Products with a low-cost advantage over many of its competitors. 
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 12 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


Distribution, Marketing and SalesConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products supplies the private-label retail market, including large retailers and club stores, branded food companies, food manufacturers, foodservice distributors, quick service and casual dining restaurants located principally in North America. In addition, it markets branded food products under SunOpta-controlled brands, including Sunrich® Naturals, Pure Nature and Natures Finest. Consumer Products generally conducts its business with customers on the basis of purchase orders and price quotations, without other formal agreements related to minimum or maximum supplies or pricing. 
 Costco Wholesale (Costco) accounted for approximately 19% of revenues from our Consumer Products segment and approximately 11% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Costco intends to move its private label non-dairy aseptic beverage business to another supplier commencing in the second quarter of 2017. This business represented approximately 4% of the revenues from our Consumer Products segment and approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other than Costco, no customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues from our Consumer Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 SuppliersConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products raw materials are subject to the availability of seed, grain, fruit, vegetable and dairy supply, which is based on conditions that are beyond our control. Seeds and grains are sourced through Global Ingredients established grower network. Fresh and frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are sourced directly from a large number of suppliers throughout the U.S., Mexico and globally, or through Global Ingredients. We believe our scale and location close to growing areas makes Consumer Products an attractive customer for fruit growers. Organic dairy ingredients are sourced from independent distributors.
 Consumer Products also relies on its packaging suppliers to ensure delivery of often unique, portable, and convenient consumer packaging formats. In our aseptic packaging facilities we specialize in the use of Tetra Pak equipment in a variety of pack sizes and also offer a variety of opening types and extended shelf life (ESL) options. Consumer Products also partners with third party fillers to provide ESL and refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. 
 Corporate Services 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in Mississauga, Ontario. In addition, centralized information technology, human resources, operations, research and development, legal and financial shared services groups are located in Edina, Minnesota. Employees of Corporate Services provide support services across the organization including management, finance, legal, operations, business development, information technology, research and development, human resources and administrative functions.
REGULATION 
 We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, throughout the rest of the EU, China and Ethiopia. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. For example, we are affected by laws and regulations related to: seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing, packaging and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and product labeling and marketing, food safety and food defense. We are also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs and a number of environmental regulations.

USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations 
 We are involved in the sourcing, manufacturing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic seed and food products and, as such, are subject to certain organic quality assurance standards. In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act mandating that the USDA develop national standards for organically produced agricultural products to assure consumers that those products marketed as organic meet consistent, uniform standards. The Organic Foods Production Act established the National Organic Program, a marketing program housed within the Agricultural Marketing Service of the USDA. 
 In December 2000, after considering recommendations from the National Organic Standards Board, as well as private, state, and foreign organic certification programs, USDA adopted regulations with respect to a national organic production, handling, labeling and certification program contained within 7 CFR 205. The regulations became fully effective in October 2002. These regulations, among other things, set forth the minimum standards producers must meet, and have reviewed by an accredited USDA-certifying agent, in order to label their products 100% organic, organic, or made with organic ingredients and display the USDA organic seal. The regulations impose strict standards on the production of organic food products and limit the use of non-organic or synthetic materials in the production of organic foods. Generally, organic food products are produced using: 
 

agricultural management practices intended to promote and
 enhance ecosystem health; 


no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge,
 long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides; and 


food processing practices intended to protect the
 integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically
 modified organisms or synthetic preservatives. 


 After becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of agricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of the USDA organic regulations is subject to enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension or revocation of their organic certificate.
 Additionally, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. Many states have adopted their own organic programs making the state agency responsible for enforcing USDA regulations for organic operations. However, state organic programs may also add more restrictive requirements due to specific environmental conditions or the necessity of production and handling practices in the state. Applicable regulatory agencies in the U.S. include the USDA, which monitors and ensures the integrity of both the organic process and agricultural grain business, and the FDA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversee the safety, security and efficacy of the food supply in the U.S. 
 We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business and we are continuously strengthening our testing and verification processes.
 Food-Related Regulations 
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are also subject to a number of federal, state and local food-related regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the FDCA) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the U.S. The FDA: 
 

regulates manufacturing practices for foods
 through its current good manufacturing practices regulations; 


specifies the standards of identity for certain
 foods, including many of the products we sell; and 


prescribes the format and content of certain
 information required to appear on food product labels.

Some of the key food safety and food labeling regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
1. | Food Safety Regulations
---+------------------------

 The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), signed into law on January 4, 2011, enables FDA to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. The law provides FDA with new enforcement authorities and tools designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur.
 The FDA has now finalized its rules necessary to implement FSMA including: (1) Preventive Controls for Human Food, (2) Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, (3) Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption, (4) Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals, (5) Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food, (6) Mitigation Strategies to Protect Food Against Intentional Adulteration, and (7) Accredited Third-Party Certification. The compliance dates for these rules are as follows: 
  
Rules | Date Final Rule Published | Compliance Date 
-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preventive Controls for Human Food | 9/17/2015 | 9/19/2016 
Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (Subpart B) | 9/17/2015 | 9/19/2016 
Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (Subpart C) | 9/17/2015 | 9/18/2017 
Produce Safety | 11/27/2015 | 1/26/2018 
Foreign Supplier Verification Program | 11/27/2015 | 5/27/2017 (or later) 
Sanitary Transport | 4/6/2016 | 4/6/2017 
Food Defense | 5/27/2016 | 7/26/2019 
Third Party Certifications | 11/27/2015 | Requirements go into effect after FDA publishes Model Accreditation Standards 

 Many of the rules, particularly those relating to good manufacturing practices and preventive controls relating to food for human consumption, sanitary transport, and foreign supplier verification and import safety, apply to us as we manufacture, process, pack, hold and transport food for human consumption. We also work with foreign suppliers who provide us with raw materials. In the case of preventive controls for human food, we are already required to comply with the final rule. The rule contains certain key requirements as follows: 
 
a. | Food Safety Plan
---+-----------------

 Covered facilities must establish and implement a written food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls. The hazard analysis must consider known or reasonably foreseeable biological, chemical, and physical hazards. The preventive control measures are required to ensure that hazards requiring a preventive control will be minimized or prevented. They include process, food allergen, and sanitation controls, as well as supply-chain controls and a recall plan. In addition to establishing preventive controls, we must continuously ensure that the controls are effective through monitoring and verification activities. If a control fails, prompt corrective actions must be taken to identify a problem with preventive control implementation, to reduce the likelihood the problem will recur, evaluate affected food for safety, and prevent it from entering commerce. All corrective actions must be documented in writing. 
 
b. | Supply Chain Management
---+------------------------

 The final rule mandates that a manufacturing facility have a risk-based supply chain program for those raw materials and other ingredients that have an identified hazard requiring a supply-chain applied control. Accordingly, we are responsible for ensuring that foods are received only from approved suppliers, or on a temporary basis from unapproved suppliers whose materials are subject to verification activities before being accepted for use.
 
c. | Current Good Manufacturing Practices 
---+---------------------------------------

 The final rule updated and clarified current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs). Specifically, some of the previously nonbinding regulatory provisions, such as education and training, are now binding. Management is required to ensure that all employees who manufacture, process, pack or hold food are qualified and properly educated to perform their assigned duties. 
 Now that this rule has become final, we are in the process of developing regulatory compliance programs to ensure that all requirements of the rules applicable to us are met by the effective date.
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 15 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


In addition, we are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the Bioterrorism Act) and regulations issued thereunder. The Bioterrorism Act authorizes the FDA to take the regulatory action necessary to protect the nations food supply against the threat of intentional or accidental contamination. The major components of the Bioterrorism Act include registration of food facilities with the FDA; prior notice of virtually all imported food shipments under FDA authority; recordkeeping requirements for food facilities; FDA authority to administratively detain food; FDA authority to institute debarment of food importers for various violations related to food importation; and creation of a clear way to re-import previously refused foods if certain criteria are met. 
 We believe that we are in material compliance with the current regulations promulgated to implement FSMA that are applicable to our business. By way of example, we reviewed and updated our CGMP and recall policies; implemented change control, corporate supplier approval, allergen management, and environmental monitoring programs; completed food safety plans for our covered facilities; and engaged third party consultants to assist our internal resources with onsite food safety plan reviews at our facilities and to conduct on-site audits in order to strengthen our food safety system. We are continuing to develop internal compliance policies and practices for those rules that have future compliance dates in order to ensure compliance by the required deadlines.
 Lastly, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. 
 
2. | Food Labeling Regulations
---+--------------------------

 The Company is subject to certain requirements relating to food labeling under the FDCA and corresponding FDA regulations as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act enacted in 1967 and corresponding FTC regulations. Although the FTC, FDA, and USDA share jurisdiction over claims made by manufacturers of food products, the FDA retains primary jurisdiction over the labeling of food products whereas the FTC regulates advertising.
 The FDA and FTC require that all food products be labeled to disclose the net contents, the identity of commodity, nutrition information, and the name and place of business of the products manufacturer, packer, or distributor in order to prevent consumer deception. Both agencies also require that any claim on the product be truthful and not misleading.
 On May 20, 2016, the FDA announced a new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease. The FDAs Final Rules regarding the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels and Serving Sizes require manufacturers to, among other things: 
 

increase the type size for calories, servings per
 container, and the serving size declaration, and bolding the number of
 calories and the Serving size declaration to highlight this information; 


declare the actual amount, in addition to percent Daily
 Value of vitamin D, calcium, iron and potassium; 


include added sugars, in grams and as percent Daily
 Value, on the label; 


display serving sizes on labels based on amounts of foods
 and beverages that people are actually eating, not what they should be
 eating 


 Manufacturers will need to use the new label by July 26, 2018. We believe that we will be in material compliance with these new food labeling regulations where applicable to our business by the compliance date. 
 Other state and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food labeling requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as Proposition 65) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products.

-------------+----+-----------------------------

FDA Generally Regarded as Safe Regulations 
 Food ingredients can be classified into four groups including: food additives; color additives; prior sanctioned substances, and Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) substances. In particular, a food additive is a substance, the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. Food additives require premarket approval under the 1958 Food Additive Amendments to the FDCA as administered by FDA. However, in enacting those amendments, Congress recognized that many substances intentionally used in a manner whereby they are added to food would not require a formal premarket review by FDA to assure their safety, either because their safety had been established by a long history of use in food or by virtue of the nature of the substances, their customary or projected conditions of use, and the information generally available to scientists about the substances. Congress thus excluded from the definition of food additive substances that are generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures to be safe under the conditions of their intended use, or GRAS. 
 Companies may establish GRAS status through self-affirmation whereby the producer determines on its own that the ingredient is GRAS, normally with the assistance of a panel of qualified experts. The producer may also voluntarily submit a GRAS Notification to the FDA that includes the products description, conditions of use, and the basis for GRAS determination, among other information. The FDA response to a GRAS notice, typically issued within 180 days, is not an approval and the product may be marketed while the FDA is reviewing the information.
 A food ingredient is eligible for GRAS classification based on the views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of the product. The experts views are either based on scientific procedures or through experience based on common use of the material prior to 1958. If based on scientific procedures they must use the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as would be required for the FDA to issue a premarket approval of the sale of a food additive. If a food ingredient is not entitled to GRAS status, premarket approval must be sought through the filing of a Food Additive Petition. 
 A number of our products are being marketed pursuant to GRAS self-affirmation. We believe that a majority of products for which we have commercial rights are GRAS. However, such status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. Thereafter, we decide whether self-affirmation procedures and a GRAS notification will be appropriate. For those components that do not qualify for GRAS, we may be required to file a Food Additive Petition. In the event that a petition is required, we may elect to sell or license our rights to manufacture, market, and distribute the component to another party. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 The Company is also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 


Air quality regulations  air quality is regulated by the
 EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports
 are filed annually. 


Waste treatment/disposal regulations  solid waste is
 either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to
 haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer
 districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand
 (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other constituents. This can
 require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 


Sewer regulations  we have agreements with the local
 city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS.
 This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 


Hazardous chemicals regulations  Various reports are
 filed with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify
 potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities. 


Storm water  all facilities are inspected annually and
 must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies.

Employee Safety Regulations 
 We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business. 
 Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations 
 Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations.
 In Canada, the sale of food is currently regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally the federal Food and Drugs Act (FADA), Canada Agricultural Products Act (CAPA), and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), along with their supporting regulations. Some of the key Canadian regulatory instruments include but are not limited to the following: 
 

Food and Drug Regulations (under the FADA)  food
 and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, including
 composition (such as food additives, fortification, and food standards),
 packaging, labeling, advertising and marketing, and licensing
 requirements. New requirements regarding nutrition and ingredient
 labelling and food colour were introduced on December 14, 2016. To the
 extent the new labelling requirements apply to products manufactured and
 sold by the Company, we will have a five-year transitional period to adopt
 them. Amendments dealing with food colour specifications and the removal
 of synthetic colour certification requirements came into effect
 immediately. 


Organic Products Regulations, 2009 (OPR) (under
 the CAPA)  the OPR require mandatory certification to the revised
 national organic standard for agricultural products that are to be
 represented as organic in international and inter- provincial trade, or
 that bear the federal organic agricultural product legend (or federal
 logo). Except for certain exceptions and conditions, a U.S.-Canada Organic
 Equivalence Arrangement is currently in place whereby agricultural
 products produced and processed in conformity with the USDA National
 Organic Program are considered to be equivalent to the requirements of the
 OPR. 


Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)  the
 CCPSA provides oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect
 to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It includes, without
 limitation, the ability to require product recalls, mandatory incident
 reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties,
 and packaging and labeling requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to
 food, it does apply to its packaging with respect to safety. It is
 possible that there will be amendments introduced to the FADA, to capture
 the essence of the regulatory oversight found in the CCPSA. We have no way
 of anticipating if and when that may occur. 


Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act (CPLA)  the
 CPLA and its supporting regulations outline requirements for packaging and
 labeling of products, including food products. The CPLA sets out labeling
 requirements relating to the description of the product, net quantity and
 dealer information, as well as packaging standards. The CPLA also includes
 a prohibition against false or misleading labeling. 


Canada Food Inspection Agency Act (CFIAA)  the
 CFIAA grants power to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the CFIA),
 which is tasked with the administration and enforcement of certain
 Canadian food legislation. Under the CFIAA, the CFIA has the power to
 recall certain products if the Minister believes that such product poses a
 risk to the public, animal or plant health. 


Processed Products Regulations (PPR) (under the
 CAPA)  the PPR regulates the grading, packing and marking of processed
 products that are produced in Canada for inter-provincial or export trade
 or imported into Canada. Under the PPR, processed food products are those
 that are prepared to assure preservation of the food product in transport,
 distribution and storage. The PPR establishes requirements with respect to
 the content, preparation, packing and marking of processed food products. 


 In January, 2017, the Government of Canada published the second version of its proposed Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR) under the authority of the Safe Food for Canadians Act (SFCA). Publication of the SFCR was accompanied by a 90-day public consultation period. If and when they become effective, the SFCR will consolidate 13 existing Canadian regulations and the food labelling provisions of the CPLA, and thereby establish a comprehensive set of regulations which govern all food sectors subject to CFIAA oversight, including federally registered sectors and food that is destined for import, export or interprovincial trade. Principal elements of the SCFR which are likely to impact the Company include licensing requirements for the import, export and interprovincial trade of food, traceability requirements, reporting requirements and timelines, preventative controls, an export certificate request process, prescribed container sizes and weights for certain products, labelling regulations and standards of identity and expansion of organic certification to service providers and additional products. The licensing requirements will be immediate for sectors such as meat, eggs and other previously federally registered sectors and up to three years for other sectors. 
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 18 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


We are subject to Dutch and European Commission (EC) regulations and policies. Our European subsidiary, The Organic Corporation (TOC), is involved in the sourcing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). TOC is certified by Skal, the inspection body for the production of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by an EU-recognized inspection body, such as Skal, can be marketed within the entire EU. In addition, under the terms of an equivalency arrangement between the U.S. and the EU, organic operations certified to the USDA organic or EU organic standards may be labeled and sold as organic in both the U.S. and EU. 
 TOC is also affected by general food legislation both at EU and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. TOC is Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that manages the traceability of each product. In addition, TOC also considers and abides by EU and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. TOC is also subject to the regulations and policies of the countries outside of the EU in which it operates, including China and Ethiopia. 
 Following the Sunrise Acquisition, we operate a processing facility in Mexico and are subject to Mexican regulations, including regulations regarding processing, packaging and sales of food products, labor relations and profit-sharing with employees. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Research and development and new product, process and packaging innovation are key priorities of our Company and initiatives are focused on continuous improvement of our existing product portfolios and continuing efforts to improve production process to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, as well as the development of innovative new products. Innovation is a key pillar for us and a necessity in the natural and organic foods categories. We believe our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation is important to our ability to introduce new higher-margin food and beverage products to the market. 
 In June 2015, we expanded our research and development platform by opening an advanced innovation center in Edina, Minnesota. This facility supports our dedicated team of food scientists, engineers and technicians, expands our product development capabilities, increases our speed to market and enables us to proactively engage customers in creating and developing new products. We believe our innovation platform supports our leadership position in non-GMO and organic food and strengthens our relationships with our retail, foodservice and contract manufacturing customers.
 Our product development team includes highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to both the development of unique new product offerings plus addressing product development opportunities for our customers including new and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications and technical support provided to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch, as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support.
 We continue to develop new products to maximize the capabilities of our aseptic packaging facilities, including the development of non-dairy based beverages that address the growing consumer demand for beverages that satisfy allergy concerns and provide a unique nutritional profile, as well as teas, organic dairy and nutritional beverages. In addition, we continue to develop new fruit-based beverages, fruit- and grain-based snacks, nutrition bars and fruit-based re-sealable pouch products, as well as innovative fruit ingredient systems for the dairy, foodservice and beverage industries. We are also continually looking to develop new value-added products for our customers that leverage our global sourcing platform.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 The nature of a number of our products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands and trade names by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintenance of confidentiality agreements with outside parties and employees. 

SUNOPTA INC. | 19 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology.
 We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. Even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies, which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes and trade secrets. 
 PROPERTIES 
 We operate 24 processing facilities in 8 U.S. states, as well as Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Ethiopia. In addition, we also own and lease a number of office and distribution locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, France and China, and lease and utilize public warehouses to satisfy our storage needs. We also lease farmland that we sublease to fruit growers. For more details see Item 2. Properties, elsewhere in this report. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
We believe that, with respect to both our operations and real property, we are in material compliance with environmental laws at all of our locations.
 EMPLOYEES
As at December 31, 2016, we had a total of approximately 2,000 full-time employees (January 2, 2016  2,100, which included 270 employed at Opta Minerals). We also employ up to 2,000 seasonal employees in the U.S. and Mexico during peak fruit seasons each year. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations. 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on our website at www.sunopta.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and applicable Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA).
 Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below and elsewhere in this report. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all possible risks or uncertainties applicable to our business. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report and in the other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC and the CSA.
Risks Related to Our Ongoing Operational Review and Significant Investors 
 We are conducting a thorough review of the Companys operations, management and governance. Both the process of conducting this review and its outcome and implementation could pose a number of risks that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations 
 We are conducting a thorough review of our operations, management and governance in partnership with representatives of Oaktree. Among other things, the Board has committed to a further review of governance and leadership with a particular focus on continuing to add independent directors with significant expertise in the food industry and continuing to ensure that we have the management resources to implement our strategy and the action items that emerge from our operational review. We are also implementing a number of operational actions to improve our profitability and streamline our operations for long-term success. These actions may include rationalization or consolidation of certain of our operations or facilities, reinvestment in certain of our operations or facilities, investments in personnel, processes and tools, as well as other cost saving initiatives. These actions could consume capital resources and could also give rise to impairment and other restructuring charges that would be both cash and non-cash in nature, and these charges could be material.
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 20 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


We have not yet finalized our review, but you should be aware that we may decide to take actions with a material impact on our operations, strategy, governance, management and future prospects. In 2016, we announced the closures of our San Bernardino, California juice facility and Heuvelton, New York soy extraction facility, resulting in the write-down of related assets amounting to $11.5 million. Certain actions that we take may lead to additional write-downs of assets and/or charges in future periods. In addition, we cannot predict whether the actions we take will achieve our goals of improving our profitability and financial performance and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Our ongoing review could expose us to a number of other risks, including the following:
 

distraction of management; 


difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key
 personnel as a result of uncertainty generated by the review and the
 implementation of any resulting recommendations; 


difficulties in maintaining relationships or arrangements
 with customers, suppliers and other third parties; and 


increases in general and administrative expenses
 associated with the need to retain and compensate business and recruiting
 consultants and other advisors. 


 Further, we do not intend to discuss or disclose further developments during this review process unless and until the Board has approved a specific action. Accordingly, speculation regarding any developments related to the review of our operations, management and governance and perceived uncertainties related to our future could cause our stock price or the price of our debt to fluctuate significantly.
 The occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial results, liquidity and financial condition.
 Our significant investors may have interests that conflict with those of our debtholders and other stakeholders 
 Under the agreements executed in connection with our strategic partnership with Oaktree, Oaktree initially may acquire common stock of SunOpta Inc. representing up to 19.99% of SunOpta Inc.s outstanding common stock. This percentage may be increased to 27% under certain circumstances, subject to shareholder approval.
 Oaktree has nominated two members of the Board and is entitled to designate two nominees for election to the Board so long as it beneficially owns or controls at least 11.1% of SunOpta Inc.s common stock on an as-exchanged basis. If Oaktree beneficially owns or controls less than 11.1% but more than 5% of SunOpta Inc.s common stock on an as-exchanged basis, it will be entitled to designate one nominee. In addition, Engaged Capital has nominated one member of our Board.
 Oaktree is participating in our ongoing review of our operations, management and governance. Oaktrees objectives and perspectives during this review may not always be aligned with those of other stakeholders, including our debtholders and smaller shareholders. 
 The interests of Oaktree and Engaged Capital, as well as their affiliates, may differ from the interests of our other stakeholders in material respects. For example, our large investors and their affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us, including risks to our liquidity and financial condition. Our large investors and their affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. 
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 21 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


A concentration of ownership within our large investors could potentially be disadvantageous to, or conflict with, interests of our debtholders or smaller shareholders. In addition, if any significant shareholder were to sell or otherwise transfer all or a large percentage of its holdings, we could find it difficult to raise capital, if needed, through the sale of additional equity securities. 
 Risks Related to Our Business
 Product liability suits, recalls and threatened market withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our business
 Many of our products are susceptible to harmful bacteria, and the sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury or illness to consumers. Such injuries may result from inadvertent mislabeling, tampering by unauthorized third parties, faulty packaging materials, product contamination, or spoilage. Under certain circumstances, we or our customers may be required to recall or withdraw products, which may lead to a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations. Our customers may also voluntarily recall or withdraw a product we manufactured or packaged, even without consulting us, which could increase our potential liability and costs and result in lost sales. A product recall or withdrawal could result in significant losses due to the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. In addition, we could be forced to temporarily close one or more production facilities. Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall or market withdrawal, product liability claims might be asserted against us. If a product recall or withdrawal were to lead to a decline in sales of a similar or related product sold by a customer or other third party, that party could also initiate litigation against us. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities and those of our co-packers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of any of our products causes, or is alleged to have caused, a health-related illness in the future, we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image. 
 For example, on July 29, 2016, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries agreed to pay $5.0 million in cash and up to $4.0 million in rebates to one of our customers to settle litigation filed by the customer in connection with a voluntary recall of certain pouch products manufactured at our subsidiarys Allentown, Pennsylvania facility.
 On May 3, 2016, we announced a voluntary recall of certain sunflower kernel products produced at our Crookston, Minnesota facility that have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, and a number of our customers initiated recalls of their products that contain the affected sunflower kernels as an ingredient or component. While we have recognized estimated losses of $40.0 million related to this recall, we may need to revise our estimates to be materially larger as we continue to work with our customers to substantiate the claims received to date and any additional claims that may be received. We may also incur costs that are significantly greater than our previous estimates. These revisions of our estimated losses and costs may occur at any time as we continue this process. 
 Additionally, these losses do not reflect costs associated with the interruption of production at the Crookston facility for the period from April 21, 2016 to the time regular production resumed on or about May 15, 2016, subject to a positive release protocol, or the costs to put into place corrective and preventive actions at our roasting facilities. Our remediation efforts are ongoing, and we expect to continue to incur related costs, which may be material. Further, we are currently unable to estimate the full impact that this recall may have on our future sales of sunflower products or on our ongoing relationships with our customers. The recall may cause us to lose future revenues from, or relationships with, one or more material customers, and the impact of the recall could affect our customers willingness to continue to purchase other unrelated products from us or could hinder our ability to grow our business with those customers. We may not be able to determine the full extent of the losses related to the recall for some time and certain factors impacting these losses, such as our customers processes for developing their claims, the timing of submission of any such claims and the terms of our customers insurance policies and related coverage, are beyond our control.
 Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we may incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a further product recall could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses caused by third parties could harm our business 
 Our internal processes and training may not be fully effective in preventing contamination of food products that could lead to food-borne illnesses. We rely on third-party suppliers and distributors, which increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents (such as e. coli, salmonella or listeria) could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations. If consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products or organic products generally, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Instances of food-borne illnesses, whether real or perceived, and whether or not traceable to our operations or a result of our actions or omissions, could cause negative publicity about us or the products we serve, which could adversely affect sales. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by contaminated products sold by third parties could cause customers to shift their preferences, even if no food-borne illnesses or injuries are traced to our products. As a result, our sales may decline. Loss of customers as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could harm our business.
 Litigation and regulatory enforcement concerning marketing and labeling of food products could adversely affect our business and reputation 
 The marketing and labeling of any food product in recent years has brought increased risk that consumers will bring class action lawsuits and that the FTC and/or state attorneys general will bring legal action concerning the truth and accuracy of the marketing and labeling of the product. Examples of causes of action that may be asserted in a consumer class action lawsuit include fraud, unfair trade practices, and breach of state consumer protection statutes (such as Proposition 65 in California). The FTC and/or state attorneys general may bring legal action that seeks removal of a product from the marketplace, and impose fines and penalties. Even when not merited, class claims, action by the FTC or state attorneys general enforcement actions can be expensive to defend and adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We are subject to significant food and health regulations 
 We are affected by a wide range of governmental regulations in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and several countries in Europe, among others. These laws and regulations are implemented at the national level (including, among others, federal laws and regulation in Canada and the U.S.) and by local subdivisions (including, among others, state laws in the U.S. and provincial laws in Canada). We are also subject to regulations of the EU and the regulatory authority of regulatory agencies in several different countries. Examples of regulatory agencies influencing our operations include: the USDA, the FDA, the DHS, the EPA, the CFIA, and Skal, among others.
 Examples of laws and regulations that affect us include laws and regulations applicable to:
 

the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticides; 


the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and
 warehousing of seeds, grain and other products; 


the processing and sale of food, including
 wholesale operations; and 


the product labeling and marketing of food and
 food products, food safety and food defense. 


 These laws and regulations affect various aspects of our business. For example, as described in more detail under Item 1. BusinessRegulation of this report, certain food ingredient products manufactured by SunOpta are regulated under the FDCA, as administered by the FDA. Under the FDCA, pre-marketing approval by the FDA is required for the sale of a food ingredient which is a food additive unless the substance is GRAS, under the conditions of its intended use by qualified experts in food safety. We believe that most food ingredients for which we have commercial rights are GRAS. However, this status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. As a result, we may be adversely impacted if the FDA determines that our food ingredient products do not meet the criteria for GRAS.
 In addition, certain USDA regulations set forth the minimum standards producers must meet in order to have their products labeled as certified organic, and we currently manufacture a number of organic products that are covered by these regulations. While we believe our products and our supply chain are in compliance with these regulations, changes to food regulations may increase our costs to remain in compliance. We could lose our organic certification if a facility becomes contaminated with non-organic materials or if we do not use raw materials that are certified organic. The loss of our organic certifications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 23 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


Our business is subject to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA). PACA regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs our purchases of fresh produce and sales of frozen produce. We source fresh produce under licenses issued by the USDA, as required by PACA. Our failure to comply with the PACA requirements could, among other things, result in civil penalties, suspension or revocation of our licenses to sell produce and in certain cases, criminal prosecution, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in any government laws and regulations applicable to our operations could increase our compliance costs, negatively affect our ability to sell certain products or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while we believe we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations, we cannot assure you that we have been, or will at all times be, in compliance with all food production and health requirements, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Our failure to comply with any laws, regulations or policies applicable to our business could result in fines, lawsuits, enforcement actions, penalties or loss in the ability to sell certain products, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We may require additional capital to maintain current growth rates, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
 We have grown via a combination of internal growth and acquisitions requiring available financial resources. Our ability to raise capital, through equity or debt financing, is directly related to our ability to both continue to grow and improve returns from our operations. Debt or equity financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, any future equity financing would dilute our current shareholders and may result in a decrease in our share price if we are unable to realize adequate returns. We will not be able to maintain our growth rate and/or acquire complementary businesses within the natural and organic food industries without continued access to capital resources. 
 Impairment charges in goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
 As a result of business acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets is comprised of intangible assets and goodwill. We are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of these assets. We may engage in additional acquisitions, which could result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill. If the financial performance of the acquired businesses is not as strong as we anticipate, we could be required to record significant impairments to intangible assets and/or goodwill, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 We operate in a highly competitive industry
 We operate businesses in highly competitive product and geographic markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and various other international markets. We compete with various U.S. and international commercial grain procurement marketers, major companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient companies, trading companies, and consumer-packaged food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients and other food companies involved in natural and organic foods. These competitors may have financial resources and staff larger than ours and may be able to benefit from economies of scale, pricing advantages and greater resources to launch new products that compete with our offerings. We have little control over and cannot otherwise affect these competitive factors. If we are unable to effectively respond to these competitive factors or if the competition in any of our product markets results in price reductions or decreased demand for our products, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
 Our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us 
 Many of our customers buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot provide assurance that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in our customers sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Loss of a key customer could materially reduce revenues and earnings 
 Our relationships with our key customers are critical to the success of our business and our results of operations. One of our customers accounted for approximately 11% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. We do not expect to receive the same level of revenue from this customer in 2017, which could adversely affect our total revenues for the year. The loss or cancellation of business with any of our other larger customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Consumer preferences for natural and organic food products are difficult to predict and may change 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability and our customers ability to offer products that anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and appeal to their preferences on a timely and affordable basis. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or products that utilize our integrated foods platform, or our failure to maintain our current market position, could reduce our sales and harm our business. Consumer trends change based on a number of possible factors, including nutritional values, a change in consumer preferences or general economic conditions. Additionally, there is a growing focus among some consumers to buy local food products in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting food products from longer distances, which could result in a decrease in the demand for food products and ingredients that we import from other countries or transport from remote processing locations or growing regions. Further, failures by us or our competitors to deliver quality products could erode consumer trust in the organic certification of foods. These changes could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price decreases, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 If we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected 
 Our supply chain is complex. We rely on suppliers for our raw materials and for the manufacturing, processing, packaging and distribution of many of our products. The inability of any of these suppliers to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall. Many of our products are perishable and require timely processing and transportation to our customers. Additionally, many of our products can only be stored for a limited amount of time before they spoil and cannot be sold. We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date. If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating costs could increase and our margins could fall, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Some of our operations are subject to seasonal supply fluctuations. For example, we purchase strawberries and other fruit from farmers during the peak California growing season, which occurs during the first two quarters of the year. As a result, our costs may be higher during these periods. We may not be successful in counteracting or smoothing out the effects of seasonality, and we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to remain subject to significant seasonality.
 Part of our supply source also depends in part on a seasonal temporary workforce comprised primarily of migrant workers. Changes in immigration laws or policies that discourage migration to the U.S. and political or other events (such as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that make it more difficult for individuals to immigrate to or migrate throughout the U.S. could adversely affect the migrant worker population and reduce the workforce available for farms and production facilities in the U.S. Additionally, increased competition from other industries for migrant workers could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Volatility in the prices of raw materials and energy could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins 
 Raw materials represent a significant portion of our cost of sales. Our cost to purchase services and materials, such as grains, fruits and other commodities, processing aids, and natural gas, can fluctuate depending on many factors, including weather patterns, economic and political conditions and pricing volatility. In addition, we must compete for limited supplies of these raw materials and services with competitors having greater resources than us. If our cost of materials and services increases due to any of the above factors, we may not be able to pass along the increased costs to our customers.
 We enter into a number of exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts to partially hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations. Futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges. Our inventories, however, may not be completely hedged, due in part to our assessment of exposure from expected price fluctuations and an inability to hedge a number of raw materials.
 Exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risks that a counterparty to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation. We may be unable to hedge 100% of the price risk of each transaction due to timing and availability of hedge contracts and third party credit risk. In addition, we have a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the commodity as scheduled. We also monitor the prices of natural gas and from time to time lock in a percentage of our natural gas needs based on current prices and expected trends.

Our future results of operations may be adversely affected by the availability of organic and non-GMO ingredients 
 Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of organic and non-GMO ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow organic and non-GMO crops, climate conditions, changes in national and world economic conditions, currency fluctuations and forecasting adequate need of seasonal ingredients. 
 The organic and non-GMO ingredients that we use in the production of our products (including, among others, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains) are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, water scarcity, temperature extremes, frosts, earthquakes and pestilences. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of organic or non-GMO ingredients or increase the prices of organic or non-GMO ingredients. If our supplies of organic or non-GMO ingredients are reduced, we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms, if at all, which could impact our ability to supply product to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could impose costs on our business 
 Our various food products, from seeds and grains to ingredients, fruits, vegetables and other inputs, are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including windstorms, hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires, temperature extremes and earthquakes, some of which are common but difficult to predict, as well as crop disease and infestation. Severe weather conditions may occur with higher frequency or may be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions could reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters may adversely affect our supply of one or more food products or prevent or impair our ability to ship products as planned. These factors can increase costs, decrease our sales volumes and revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 A significant portion of our fruit supply is sourced from California, which continued to experience severe drought conditions for the fifth consecutive year in 2016 due to extremely low levels of rainfall. Such conditions have resulted in lost crops as well as increased water costs for growers in California. In particular, we depend on growers in California for strawberries. In January 2014, a drought state of emergency was declared in California and, among other actions, legislation was passed requiring monitoring of groundwater pumping, which limits the amount of groundwater for which farmers can drill. Strawberry growers are largely dependent on well water, and diminishing groundwater resources could lead to a reduced strawberry supply. In April 2015, statewide mandatory water conservation measures were imposed in California, including increased water use reporting by agricultural water users, enhancing the states ability to enforce against diversions and unreasonable use of water in an effort to curtail wasteful water practices in agricultural fields. Although the drought conditions in California significantly improved in late 2016 and early 2017, the mandatory water conservation measures remain in place. While farms have been largely exempted from the strict water conservation measures imposed statewide, which have mostly targeted urban water use, a worsening of drought conditions could lead to more restrictive measures aimed at the agricultural industry. Recurring drought conditions and existing and future water conservation laws could negatively impact the agricultural industry in California and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 An interruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could negatively affect our business, and our business continuity plan may prove inadequate 
 We own or lease, manage and operate a number of manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage and office facilities. We could be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of disasters, epidemics, business interruptions or other similar events. Some of our inventory and manufacturing facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather, and the production of certain of our products is concentrated in a few geographic areas. In addition, we store chemicals used in the equipment for quick freezing of fruit or used for cooling processes during ingredient processing, and our storage of these chemicals could lead to risk of leaks, explosions or other events. Although we have a business continuity plan, we cannot provide assurance that our business continuity plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of any of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or epidemics prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain our labor force at one or more of our facilities, we could experience delays in production or delivery of our products, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 
 In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. Furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 If we lose the services of our key management, our business could suffer 
 Our prospects depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our key executives, and our continued growth depends on our ability to identify, recruit and retain key management personnel. We are also dependent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our personnel. We do not typically carry key person life insurance on our executive officers. If we lose the services of our key management or fail to identify, recruit and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
 If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our results of operations and our growth could be adversely affected 
 Labor is a significant component of the cost of operating our business. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors, such as employment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees from our competitors and other industries, higher employee-turnover rates, unionization of farm workers or increases in the federal- or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers compensation insurance), our operating expenses could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Technological innovation by our competitors could make our food products less competitive
 Our competitors include major food ingredient and consumer-packaged food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food and food ingredients. Many of these companies are engaged in the development of food ingredients and other packaged food products and frequently introduce new products into the market. Existing products or products under development by our competitors could prove to be more effective or less costly than our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness of our products and our business. 
 We rely on protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions.
 Our trademarks and brand names are registered in the U.S., Canada and other jurisdictions. We intend to keep these filings current and seek protection for new trademarks to the extent consistent with business needs. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain of the technologies and processes that we use.
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 28 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


The failure of any patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to provide protection to our technologies would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, which could result in lower sales or gross margins. 
 Changes in laws or regulations governing foreign trade or taxation could adversely affect our business 
 Changes in governmental laws or regulations affecting foreign trade or taxation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. Such changes could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. 
 On January 20, 2017, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the President of the United States. President Trump has expressed an intention to change existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Any changes to NAFTA could impact our Mexican and Canadian operations. President Trump has also indicated an intention to request that Congress make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing U.S. tax laws and foreign trade with countries where we or our customers operate, in particular Canada, Mexico and Europe, could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
Our operations are influenced by agricultural policies 
 We are affected by governmental agricultural policies such as price supports and acreage set aside programs and these types of policies may affect our business. The production levels, markets and prices of the grains and other raw products that we use in our business are materially affected by government programs, which include acreage control and price support programs of the USDA. Revisions in these and other comparable programs, in the U.S. and elsewhere, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of our operations. 
 We are subject to substantial environmental regulation and policies 
 We are, and expect to continue to be, subject to substantial federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulation. Some of the key environmental regulations to which we are subject include air quality regulations of the EPA and certain city/state/provincial air pollution control groups, waste treatment/disposal regulations, sewer regulations under agreements with local city sewer districts, regulations governing hazardous substances, storm water regulations and bioterrorism regulations. For a more detailed summary of the environmental regulations and policies to which we are subject, see Item 1. BusinessRegulation of this report. Our business also requires that we have certain permits from various state, provincial and local authorities related to air quality, storm water discharge, solid waste, land spreading and hazardous waste.
 In the event that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of potentially hazardous materials in certain of our businesses were to fail, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. In addition, changes to environmental regulations may require us to modify our existing plant and processing facilities and could significantly increase the cost of those operations.
 The foregoing environmental regulations, as well as others common to the industries in which we participate, can present delays and costs that can adversely affect business development and growth. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any changes to current regulations may impact the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products, and may have a negative impact on our future results. 
 Climate change laws could have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
 Legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada and internationally will likely continue to consider numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to produce, manufacture and distribute our products, we and our suppliers use fuels, electricity and various other inputs that result in the release of greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns about the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change may result in environmental taxes, charges, regulatory schemes, assessments or penalties, which could restrict or negatively impact our operations, as well as those of our suppliers, who would likely pass all or a portion of their costs along to us. We may not be able to pass any resulting cost increases along to our customers. Any enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change laws by the U.S., Canada or any other international jurisdiction where we conduct business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity 
 We are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as our non-U.S.-based operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes and we also sell product in currencies that are different from the currency used to purchase materials, or process finished goods. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. We are exposed to price fluctuations on a number of commodities as we hold inventory and enter into transactions to buy and sell products in a number of markets. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about these risks can be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report. As a result of these exposures, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 Our international operations expose us to additional risks 
 We source our products from numerous suppliers and growers from around the world. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, we have processing, packaging and warehousing facilities in Mexico, Europe, Africa and Asia. Our international operations and customers expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:
 

exposure to local economic conditions, expropriation and
 nationalization, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; 


withholding and other taxes on remittances and other
 payments by subsidiaries; 


investment restrictions or requirements; 


export and import restrictions; 


compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws,
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 


compliance with export controls and economic sanctions
 laws; 


increases in working capital requirements related to long
 supply chains; and 


disruptions in our supply chain from unforeseen events,
 such as natural disasters, terrorism and political and civil unrest. 


 For example, we have significant operations in Mexico, including a facility in the State of Michoacán, near areas where there have been incidents of unrest, which may heighten the risks of our international operations described above.
 As we continue to expand our business globally, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our international operations may face, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any acquisition of businesses with operations outside of the U.S. and Canada may exacerbate this risk.
 A significant portion of our assets and certain of our executive officers and directors are located outside of the U.S.; it may be difficult to effect service of process and enforce legal judgments upon us and certain of our executive officers and directors
 A significant portion of our assets and certain of our executive officers and directors are located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the U.S. and enforce judgment of a U.S. court obtained against us or our executive officers and directors. Particularly, our stakeholders may not be able to:
 

effect service of process within the U.S. on us
 or certain of our executive officers and directors; 


enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts
 against us or certain of our executive officers and directors based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities
laws;

enforce, in a court outside of the U.S., judgments of
 U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal
 securities laws; or 
bring an original action in a court outside of the U.S.
 to enforce liabilities against us or any of our executive officers and
 directors based upon the U.S. federal securities laws. 

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
 Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including, without limitation, impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes. In addition, we will have to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal, premium (if any) and interest on our indebtedness which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our level of indebtedness will also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, and may compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures as compared to our competitors. 
 Our debt and equity agreements restrict how we may operate our business, and our business may be materially and adversely affected if these restrictions prevent us from implementing our business plan 
 The agreements governing our debt and preferred equity instruments contain restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to obtain additional debt financing, to create other liens, to complete a merger, amalgamation or consolidation, to make certain distributions or make certain payments, investments and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets. These restrictions may hinder our ability to execute on our growth strategy or prevent us from implementing parts of our business plan.
 Our business may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to renew the Global Credit Facility
The Global Credit Facility matures on February 10, 2021. We may not be able to renew this facility to the same level or size, or on terms as favorable as at present. A reduced facility may impact our ability to finance our business, requiring us to scale back our operations and our use of working capital. Alternatively, obtaining credit on less favorable terms would have a direct impact on our profitability and operating flexibility. 
 Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to meet the financial covenants of the Global Credit Facility
Our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the Global Credit Facility agreement will depend on the success of our businesses, our operating results, and our ability to achieve our financial forecasts. Various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants and terms of the Global Credit Facility agreement. Failure to comply with our financial covenants and other terms could result in an event of default and the acceleration of amounts owing under this agreement, unless we were able to negotiate a waiver. The lenders could condition any such waiver on an amendment to the agreement on terms (including, but not limited to, the payment of consent fees) that may be unfavorable to us. If we are unable to negotiate a covenant waiver or replace or refinance the Global Credit Facility agreement on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted. 
 Risks Related to Business Acquisitions and Divestures 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and integrate acquired companies 
 From time to time we may pursue acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our overall growth strategy. In 2015, we completed the Sunrise Acquisition, which was the largest acquisition in the history of our company. Our ability to effectively integrate Sunrise, as well as other past or future business acquisitions, including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings in a timely and efficient manner will have a direct impact on our future results. We may encounter problems in connection with the integration of any new businesses, such as challenges relating to the following:

SUNOPTA INC. | 31 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------



integration of an acquired companys products into our
 product mix;


the amount of cost savings that may be realized as a
 result of our integration of an acquired product or business; 

unanticipated quality and production issues with acquired
 products; 

adverse effects on business relationships with suppliers
 and customers; 

diversion of management attention; 

integrating acquired operations that have management
 teams and company cultures that differ from our own; 

difficulty with personnel and loss of key employees; 

implementation of an integrated enterprise-wide
 accounting and information system and consolidation of back office
 accounting; 

compatibility of financial control and information
 systems; 

exchange rate risk with respect to acquisitions outside
 the U.S.; 

potential for patent and trademark claims or other
 litigation against or involving the acquired company; 

integration of businesses that operate in new geographic
 areas, including difficulties in identifying and gaining access to
 customers in new markets; and 

in the case of foreign acquisitions, uncertainty
 regarding foreign laws and regulations and difficulty integrating
 operations and systems as a result of cultural, systems and operational
 differences. 

 If we experience any of these problems in the integration of acquisitions, they could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We may not have accurately estimated the benefits or synergies to be realized from business acquisitions 
 Our expected benefits and synergies from acquired businesses may not be realized if our cash flow estimates associated with the assets of those businesses are materially inaccurate or if we fail to identify operating problems or liabilities prior to acquisition. We perform inspections of the assets to be acquired, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, the accuracy of our assessments of the assets and our estimates are inherently uncertain. There could also be environmental or other problems that were not discovered in the course of our due diligence and inspections. If problems or risks are identified after the closing of an acquisition, there may be limited recourse against the former owners.
 Business acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities 
 We will be subject to all of the liabilities of acquired businesses, including legal and administrative proceedings. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected. Moreover, to the extent there is indemnification against losses and liabilities in these businesses acquisition agreements, the amount of indemnification available could be limited and may not be sufficient to cover the actual losses we may suffer.
 Business acquisitions could result in unexpected disruptions of our business 
 In response to an acquisition, the acquired businesss customers may cease or reduce their business with the acquired business or some of our customers may cease or reduce their business with us, which could negatively affect our combined operations. Similarly, current or prospective employees of us or of the acquired businesses may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined entity. This may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, marketing and technical personnel. In addition, the diversion of the attention of our respective management teams away from day-to-day operations during the pendency of the business acquisition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

The possible future divestiture of businesses could impact our profitability
 We may, from time to time, divest businesses that are no longer a strategic fit or no longer meet our growth or profitability targets. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sales of such businesses, or lost operating income or cash flows from such businesses. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to divested businesses, or indemnify buyers for liabilities, which may reduce our profitability and cash flows. We may also not be able to negotiate such divestitures on terms acceptable to us. Such potential divestitures will require management resources and may divert managements attention from our day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in divesting such businesses, our business could be harmed. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Shares 
 Our operating results and share price are subject to significant volatility 
 Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to:
 

changes in our customers and/or their demand; 


changes in our operating expenses; 


managements ability to execute our business strategies
 focused on improved operating earnings; 


organizational and personnel changes; 


interruption in operations at our facilities; 


product recalls or market withdrawals; 


legal and administrative cases (whether civil, such as
 environmental or product related, or criminal), settlements, judgments and
 investigations; 


foreign currency fluctuations; 


supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations; and 


general economic conditions. 


 In addition, our share price may be highly volatile compared to larger public companies. Certain announcements could have a significant effect on our share price, including announcements regarding:
 

fluctuations in financial performance from
 period to period; 


mergers, acquisitions and/or divestitures,
 either by us or key competitors; 


changes in key personnel; 


strategic partnerships or arrangements; 


litigation and governmental inquiries; 


changes in governmental regulation and policy; 


patents or proprietary rights; 



SUNOPTA INC. | 33 | December 31, 2016 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------



changes in consumer preferences and demand;


new financings; and 

general market conditions. 

 Higher volatility increases the chance of larger than normal price swings which reduces predictability in the price of our common shares and could impair investment decisions. In addition, price and volume trading volatility in the stock markets can have a substantial effect on our share price, frequently for reasons other than our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
 In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.
 Our debt instruments restrict, and our future debt instruments may restrict, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future; therefore, our shareholders may not be able to receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold 
 We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common shares. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future because, among other reasons, we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth of our business. In addition, the covenants included in our debt instruments, and the covenants to be included in our future debt instruments may restrict our ability to receive cash from our subsidiaries and pay dividends on our common shares. The future payment of dividends will be dependent on factors such as these covenant restrictions, cash on hand, or achieving and maintaining profitability, the financial requirements to fund growth, our general financial condition and other factors the Board may consider appropriate in the circumstances. Until we pay dividends, which we may never do, our shareholders will not receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold.
 The future issuance of additional common shares in connection with the exchange of convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock options, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities could dilute the value of our common shares 
 We have unlimited common shares authorized but unissued. Our articles of amalgamation authorize us to issue these common shares, and we may also issue options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common shares for consideration and on terms and conditions established by the Board in its sole discretion.
 The exchange of convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan, and issuance of additional securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise could result in dilution in the value of our common shares and the voting power represented thereby. Furthermore, to the extent common shares are issued pursuant to the exchange of convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities, our share price may decrease due to the additional amount of common shares available in the market. The subsequent sales of these shares could encourage short sales by our shareholders and others, which could place further downward pressure on our share price. Moreover, the holders of our stock options may hedge their positions in our common shares by short selling our common shares, which could further adversely affect our stock price.
 If securities or industry research analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common shares, our share price and trading volume could decline
 The trading market for our common shares relies in part on the research and reports that securities and industry research analysts publish about us, our industry, our competitors and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Our share price and trading volumes could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our common shares, issue unfavorable commentary about us, our industry or our business, cease to cover our Company or fail to regularly publish reports about us, our industry or our business.
