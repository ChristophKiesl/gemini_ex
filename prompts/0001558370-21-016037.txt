Primary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments
Chase Corporation (the “Company,” “Chase,” “we,” or “us”), a global specialty chemicals company founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications across diverse market sectors. Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Through investments in facilities, systems and organizational consolidation we seek to improve performance and gain economies of scale. 
We are organized into three reportable operating segments: an Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, an Industrial Tapes segment and a Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products manufactured and how they are delivered to their respective markets. 
The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment offers innovative and specialized product offerings consisting of both end-use products and intermediates that are generally used in, or integrated into, another company’s product. Demand for the segment’s product offerings is typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment leverages the core specialty chemical competencies of the Company and serves diverse markets and applications. The segment sells predominantly into the transportation, appliances, medical, general industrial and environmental market verticals. The segment’s products include moisture protective coatings and cleaners, and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics, polymeric microspheres, polyurethane dispersions and superabsorbent polymers. Beginning September 1, 2020, the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment includes the acquired operations of ABchimie, within the electronic and industrial coatings product line and beginning February 5, 2021, the acquired operations of Emerging Technologies, Inc (“ETi”), within the functional additives product line. 
The Industrial Tapes segment features wire and cable materials, specialty tapes and other laminated and coated products. The segment derives its competitive advantage through its proven chemistries, its diverse specialty offerings and the reliability its supply chain offers to end customers. These products are generally used in the assembly of other manufacturers’ products, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Industrial Tapes segment sells mostly to established markets, with some exposure to growth opportunities through further development of existing products. Markets served include cable manufacturing, utilities and telecommunications, and electronics packaging. The segment’s offerings include insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers, laminated durable papers, laminates for the packaging and industrial laminate markets, custom manufacturing services, pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cables and water and natural gas lines and cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape-and-reel packaging. 
The Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as “Chase” branded products. End markets include new and existing infrastructure projects on oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines, highways and bridge decks, water and wastewater containment systems, and commercial buildings. The segment’s products include protective coatings for pipeline applications, coating and lining systems for waterproofing and liquid storage applications, adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications, high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, and expansion joint systems for waterproofing applications in transportation and architectural markets. With sales generally dependent on outdoor project work, the segment experiences highly seasonal sales patterns.
Our manufacturing facilities are distinct to their respective segments apart from our O’Hara Township, PA, Blawnox, PA and Hickory, NC facilities, which produce products related to a combination of operating segments.

​
Human Capital Management
​
Chase Corporation’s success derives from its dedicated employees worldwide, who are responsible for the operations, innovation and ethics core to our business and its future. In 2021, our employees continued to navigate the challenges of COVID-19, and, with an overarching commitment to health and safety, maintained a commitment to our customers, including providing products to critical industries such as healthcare, utilities, infrastructure and telecommunications.
​
As of October 31, 2021, we employed approximately 661 people (including union employees). 81% were U.S. based and 19% international. 26% of our employees worked in administrative, selling and research and development functions, while 74% worked in the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Given macrotrends faced worldwide, Chase currently operates in an increasingly competitive landscape in hiring and retaining a manufacturing labor force. We consider our employee relations to be good. In the U.S., we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the U.S., we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements. 
We have policies in place designed to provide a safe and healthy workplace and comply with applicable safety and health regulations and our own internal requirements. We work to provide and maintain a safe, healthy and productive workplace, in consultation with our employees, by addressing and remediating identified risks of accidents, injury and health impacts.
We strive to maintain workplace environments that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, sex, color, national or social origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, political opinion, or any other status protected by applicable law. The qualities and characteristics we seek for recruitment, hiring, placement, development, training, compensation, and advancement at the Company are job qualifications, performance, skills, and experience.
​
Respect for human rights is a fundamental value of the Company. Chase strives to respect and promote human rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in our relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers, and vendors. Our aim is to further advance human rights within the communities in which we operate. The Chase Corporation’s Human Rights and Supplier Code of Conduct policies and statements on Safety Performance, Environmental Impact and Energy and Resources are available on the Chase Corporation website (www.chasecorp.com).
​
Backlog, Customers and Competition
​
As of October 31, 2021, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately $30,390,000.  This compared with a backlog of $15,949,000 as of October 31, 2020. The increase in backlog from the prior year amount was primarily due to: (a) raw material supply and logistics challenges broadly seen worldwide increasing the balance for the current year; and (b) a reduction from historical norms in the prior year given the impact of COVID-19 on that period. While we continue to work with our customers, venders and supply chain partners to prioritize the flow of goods, our backlog has increased to over one month’s worth of sales. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government.
​
There are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us.  Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price. 
​
Raw Materials
​
We obtain raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, with alternative sources of most essential materials available within reasonable lead times.
