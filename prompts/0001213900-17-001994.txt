ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2 (the “Company” or “we”) is a blank check company formed on July 15, 2014 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses that operate in the specialty chemicals and performance materials industries.
 
On January 22, 2015, we closed our initial public offering of 35,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75 per half share commencing 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination. Simultaneous with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 18,000,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $9,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by our sponsor, Quinpario Partners 2, LLC.
 
Recent Developments
 
In January 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders. At the meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we had to consummate an initial business combination to July 24, 2017. In connection with the extension, holders of 14,901,399 public shares exercised their right to convert such public shares into a pro rata portion of the trust account established in connection with our initial public offering. As a result, $201,543,292 remained in our trust account as of January 19, 2017.


On February 21, 2017, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Quinpario Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SourceHOV Merger Sub”), Quinpario Merger Sub II, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Novitex Merger Sub” and together with SourceHOV Merger Sub, the “Merger Subs”), Novitex Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Novitex”), SourceHOV Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SourceHOV”), Novitex Parent, L.P. (“Novitex Parent”), HOVS LLC and HandsOn Fund 4 I, LLC (collectively, the “HGM Group”). The transaction will result in the formation of a market-leading business process outsourcing platform with expertise in financial technology, information services and data processing. Novitex, a North American provider of technology-driven managed services, is owned by certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE: APO). SourceHOV is majority owned by HandsOn Global Management, LLC and affiliates, and provides Transaction Processing Solutions (“TPS”) and Enterprise Information Management (“EIM”) solutions.
 
The Agreement provides for (i) the merger of SourceHOV Merger Sub with and into SourceHOV, as a result of which the separate corporate existence of SourceHOV Merger Sub ceases, with SourceHOV continuing as the surviving company and a subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) the merger of Novitex Merger Sub with and into Novitex, as a result of which the separate corporate existence of Novitex Merger Sub ceases, with Novitex as the surviving company and a subsidiary of the Company.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of our stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
 
For a more detailed description of the proposed transaction, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2017. The description of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby contained in the Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Effecting a Business Combination
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. Our board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Novitex and SourceHOV.
Stockholder Approval of Initial Business Combination
 
We will seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable). We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
Our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of our proposed business combination and (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination.
 
None of our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Conversion Rights
 
At the meeting called to approve our proposed initial business combination, any public stockholder, whether voting for or against such proposed business combination, will be entitled to demand that his shares of common stock be converted for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes or for working capital). 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 15% or more of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering. Accordingly, if you purchase more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional shares of common stock or sell them in the open market. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against the proposed business combination with respect to all shares of common stock owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve the proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a substantial premium to the then current market price.
 
Our sponsor, as well as our officers and directors, will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly.

We may also require public stockholders who wish to convert, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise conversion rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the 
 proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our charter provides that if we do not complete a business combination by July 24, 2017, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest but net of franchise taxes and income taxes payable with respect to interest earned on the trust account, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption as part of a single integrated transaction, dissolve and liquidate, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors (who have contractually agreed to take such actions to effectuate such dissolution and liquidation), subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible once we determine to liquidate and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after our initial public offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Quinpario Partners LLC and Mr. Quinn have agreed that they will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, they may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations if they are required to so as we have not required them to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Additionally, the agreement entered into by Quinpario Partners LLC and Mr. Quinn specifically provides that they will have no liability as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. Moreover, they will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, plus any remaining net assets (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. Our initial stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their shares held prior to the initial public offering, or insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Quinpario Partners LLC has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity (including the time within which we have to complete a business combination). In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, liquidating the trust account may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Competition
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination with Novitex and SourceHOV, there will be, in all likelihood, significant competition from their competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. Information regarding Novitex’s and SourceHOV’s competition will be set forth in the proxy statement for the meeting to be called to approve the business combination and in other future filings.
Employees
 
We have two executive officers, none of whom is paid a salary by us. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
