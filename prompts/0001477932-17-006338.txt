ITEM 1
BUSINESS
 
Barrel Energy Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 27, 2014. We were formed to engage in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in North America.
 
Barrel Energy Inc. is an oil and gas company with a focus on assets located in North America. Currently the company holds oil & gas leases in Alberta, Canada and its current strategy is to develop its oil & gas leases beginning with a geological assessment to determine the economic potential of the oil & gas leases. The company currently holds interest in 2,560 acres of oil & gas leases known as the Bison Property. Our near-term business strategy is to conduct preliminary exploration activities on the Bison Property as laid out in more detail in the “Description of Property” section with the end goal being to achieve positive results during our exploration activities, our goal is to develop the Bison Property to commercial production and achieve positive cash flow taking into account economic considerations such as the recent downturn in the oil & gas sector. 
 
The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land totaling (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west. It is one of only a few large-scale tectonic elements in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that has significantly disturbed the Phanerozoic cover of the craton. The structure has influenced the location of oil and gas accumulations in strata ranging from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Cretaceous, and has long been a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in the region. 
 
The Peace River Arch has already established facilities for natural gas gathering and compression facilities that can be accessed based on Barrel Energy’s needs. Although the Peach River Arch region boasts well established infrastructure weather conditions do play a role in our ability to access the Bison property. For instance, the need to helicopter in equipment and or human resources may arise based on location or weather conditions.
 
Geology:
 
The Bison property is located in the Province of Alberta, Canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land (2,560 acres) which includes one suspended gas well in the Gilwood member of the Middle Devonian Watt Mountain Formation. The acreage is located in north western Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch (PRA), which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west. Sediments shed from the Arch, during deposition were deposited in abundance in braided channels, fluvial stream channels and shallow marine environments, which created numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area. Sediments were thickest adjacent to the emergent Arch with sands in of up to 180 feet in total thickness deposited in the braided channel systems coming off the structural highland. Thicknesses decreased to the east away from the source rock ultimately terminating some 75 miles east from the PRA. The Gilwood member at Bison shows approximately 7 feet of gas pay over water in the Gilwood formation and was perforated between 1,468.5m and 1,470.5m. (4,818-4,825 feet)

There is one well on the property, Invasion ELM Bison 10-15-95-15WSM. UWI 102/10-15-095-15W5/00. Currently the well is shut-in.

Disclosure of Oil and Gas Operations: The Company reviewed the status of its asset which is an unimproved oil property under lease. From this review the Company determined it does not have the adequate resources combined with the present market price of oil to develop it into a producing property. As of September 30, 2017, the Company elected to impair the asset and reduce its value to zero. The Company had impairment expense of $45,042 and $0 for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Reserves:
 
The Company did not have any reserves at September 30, 2017. Accordingly, you may not reasonably assume that the Company has any reserves on its leases.
 
Production:
 
The Company has not had production from inception (January 27, 2014) through September 30, 2017. Following is a table showing production data from inception (January 27, 2014) through September 30, 2017:

Marketing:
 
We currently do not conduct any marketing activities. We do not believe that any marketing activities will be necessary to conduct operations following on any of the properties described above. Lone Pine is currently the operation of the Bison property and will be responsible for the marketing. Should we take on the operatorship of the property then on the responsibilities would be the marketing of the oil & gas products. At this time, we have no plans for becoming an operator.
COMPETITION
 
Given the highly competitive nature of the oil & gas sector and our company being a new exploration stage company we face competition from numerous competitors within in the industry. We compete with junior and senior oil and gas companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire oil and gas properties throughout North America. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas interests is strong with many oil and gas leases available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the financial and technological information or expertise to compete with all competitors.
 
Our competitor oil and gas companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of oil and gas properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. These competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring oil and gas interests of merit or on exploring or developing their oil and gas properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire oil and gas properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. The potential for this competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further oil and gas interests or explore and develop our current or future oil and gas properties.
 
In addition, we compete with other junior oil and gas companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in companies such as ours, and this may limit our ability to raise future capital. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior oil and gas companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, helicopters, float planes, oil and gas exploration supplies and drill rigs.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
 
Other than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. We do not currently plan to spend any funds on research and development activities in the future.
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS
 
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to provincial and federal environmental regulations. Such legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on the release or emission of various substances produced in association with certain oil and natural gas operations. In addition, such legislation requires that well and facility sites are abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. Compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures and breach of such requirements may result in the suspension or revocation of necessary licenses and authorizations, civil liability for pollution damage, and the imposition of material fines and penalties.
 
Our operations are subject to numerous laws relating to environmental protection. These laws impose substantial penalties for any pollution resulting from our operations. We believe that our operations substantially comply with applicable environmental laws. The main governing body, Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans. In 2013 the AER became a new organization and began taking on regulatory functions related to energy development that were previously held by Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRD). The and the AER is the single regulator of energy development in Alberta—from application and exploration, construction and development, to abandonment, reclamation, and remediation.
