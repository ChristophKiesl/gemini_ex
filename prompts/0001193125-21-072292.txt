 Item 1. Business
Rand Capital Corporation (Rand, we, us and our) was incorporated under the laws of New York in February 1969. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and operated as an internally managed, closed-end, diversified, management investment company from that time until November 2019. 
 In November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the Closing) with East Asset Management (East). The transaction consisted of a $25 million investment in Rand by East, in exchange for approximately 8.3 million shares of Rand common stock. The consideration paid by East for the shares of Rand common stock was comprised of approximately $15.5 million of cash and a contribution of $9.5 million of portfolio assets (the Contributed Assets). Concurrent with the Closing, Rands management and staff became employees of Rand Capital Management, LLC (RCM), a registered investment adviser that has been retained by Rand as its external investment adviser. In connection with retaining RCM as our investment adviser, Rand, on November 8, 2019, entered into an investment advisory and management agreement (the Prior Investment Management Agreement) and an administration agreement (the Prior Administration Agreement) with RCM pursuant to which RCM serves as Rands investment adviser and administrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as our investment adviser and administrator are collectively referred to herein as the Transactions). 
 In late 2020, Rands Board of Directors (the Board) was advised by RCM that Callodine Group, LLC (Callodine), an entity controlled by James Morrow, intended to acquire a controlling interest in RCM, which was then-currently majority owned by East. Section 15(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) provides that any investment management contract, such as the Prior Investment Management Agreement, terminates automatically upon on its assignment. Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act provides that the transfer of a controlling interest of an investment adviser, such as was to be caused by Easts transfer of its controlling interest in RCM to Callodine (the Adviser Change in Control), constitutes an assignment. As a result of the proposed Adviser Change in Control, Rands shareholders were asked to approve a new investment advisory and management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement) with RCM at a special meeting of shareholders held on December 16, 2020 (the Special Meeting). The terms of the Investment Management Agreement are identical to those contained in the Prior Investment Management Agreement, with RCM continuing to provide investment advisory and management services to Rand following the Adviser Change in Control. Following approval by Rands shareholders at the Special Meeting, Rand, on December 31, 2020, entered into the Investment Management Agreement and a new administration agreement (the Administration Agreement) with RCM and terminated the Prior Administration Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an incentive fee, if specified benchmarks are met. 
 In connection with the Closing, we also entered into a shareholder agreement, by and between Rand and East (the Shareholder Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has the right to designate two or three persons, depending upon the size of the Board, for nomination for election to the Board. East has the right to designate (i) up to two persons if the size of the Board is composed of fewer than seven directors or (ii) up to three persons if the size of the Board is composed of seven or more directors. Easts right to designate persons for nomination for election to the Board under the Shareholder Agreement is the exclusive means by which East may designate or nominate persons for election to the Board. The Board currently consists of five directors, and East has designated Adam S. Gusky and Benjamin E. Godley to the Board. 
 After the completion of the Transactions, we are an externally managed, closed-end, diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company, or BDC, under the 1940 Act. As a BDC we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements as provided for in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets and provide managerial assistance to the portfolio companies in which we invest. See Item 1. BusinessRegulations, Business Development Company Regulations.

 In 2002, we established our small business investment company (SBIC), Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. (Rand SBIC), whereby we utilized funds borrowed from the Small Business Administration (SBA) combined with our capital to invest in portfolio companies. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (Annual Report), unless the context otherwise requires, we, the Corporation, us, and our refer to Rand Capital Corporation and Rand SBIC. Rand SBICs predecessor was organized as a Delaware limited partnership and was converted into a New York corporation in 2008, at which time our operations as a licensed SBIC were continued. Although Rand SBIC had operated as if it were a BDC, it was registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act. In 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted an Order of Exemption for Rand with respect to the operations of Rand SBIC and Rand SBIC then filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Rand SBICs board of directors is comprised of the directors of Rand, a majority of whom are not interested persons of Rand Capital Corporation or Rand SBIC. 
 Since the completion of the Transactions, we have shifted to an investment strategy focused on higher yielding debt investments and intend to elect U.S. federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (RIC) as of January 1, 2020 on our timely filed Federal tax return for the 2020 tax year. As required for the RIC election, Rand paid a special dividend to shareholders to distribute all of its accumulated earnings and profits. The Board declared a special dividend in the aggregate amount of $23.7 million, or approximately $1.62 per share, on March 3, 2020. The cash and shares of Rands common stock comprising the special dividend were distributed on May 11, 2020 to shareholders. 
 In addition, our Board declared a 2020 cash dividend of $1.33 per share on December 21, 2020. The 2020 cash dividend was paid on January 19, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2020. The cash dividend is expected to represent over 90% of Rands estimated taxable income for 2020. 
 In order to qualify to make the RIC election, Rand placed several of its investments in newly formed holding companies that facilitate a tax structure that is advantageous to the RIC election. In December 2019, Rand formed Rand Somerset Holdings Corp., Rand BeetNPath Holdings Corp., Rand Carolina Skiff Holdings Corp., Rand Filterworks Holdings Corp. and Rand GTEC Holdings Corp., (Blocker Corps) as wholly owned subsidiaries of Rand to hold certain equity investments. These subsidiaries are consolidated using United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for financial reporting purposes. The following discussion describes the operations of Rand and its wholly owned subsidiaries Rand SBIC, Rand Somerset Holdings Corp., Rand BeetNPath Holdings Corp., Rand Carolina Skiff Holdings Corp., Rand Filterworks Holdings Corp. and Rand GTEC Holdings Corp., (collectively, the Corporation). 
 Rand effected a 1-for-9 reverse stock split of its common stock effective May 21, 2020. The reverse stock split affected all issued and outstanding shares of Rands common stock, including shares held in treasury. The reverse stock split reduced the number of issued and outstanding shares of Rands common stock from 23,845,470 shares and 23,304,424 shares, respectively, to 2,648,916 shares and 2,588,800 shares, respectively. The reverse stock split affected all shareholders uniformly and did not alter any shareholders percentage interest in Rands outstanding common stock, except for adjustments for fractional shares. 
 On October 7, 2020, Rand, RCM and certain of their affiliates received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit Rand to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds, including other BDCs and registered investment companies, managed by RCM and certain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with Rands investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the Order). Pursuant to the Order, Rand is generally permitted to co-invest with affiliated funds if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Rands independent directors makes certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Rand and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect to Rand or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of Rands shareholders and is consistent with Rands investment objective and strategies.

 Our corporate office is located in Buffalo, NY and our website address is www.randcapital.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our annual and periodic reports, proxy statements and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with the SEC. Our shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol RAND. 
 Our Investment Objectives and Strategy 
 Effective with the completion of the Transactions, our investment activities are managed by our external investment adviser, RCM. As a result of the Transactions and our intention to elect RIC status, we have changed our investment objectives and strategy. Our investment objective is to generate current income and, when possible, complement this current income with capital appreciation. As a result, the investments made by Rand since the Closing have been, and the investments to be made by Rand in the future are expected to be, made primarily in debt instruments, as well as high yielding publicly traded equity instruments that provide income through dividends and relatively more liquidity than our private company equity investments. 
 We expect to co-invest in privately-held, lower middle market companies with committed and experienced managements in a broad variety of industries. We seek to invest in early to later stage businesses that have sustainable, differentiated and market-accepted products and have revenue of more than $2 million and a clear path to free cash flow or are already generating up to $5 million in EBITDA. We provide funding to companies that need growth or expansion capital or are looking to finance an ownership transition. Geographically, we focus in the eastern and southern United States. We typically are a minority investor and work with other lenders, investment partners and sponsors to source and fund investment opportunities. 
 Our typical investment going forward is expected to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million in any one company. The debt we invest in is not expected to be rated by a rating agency and, if it were, would be below investment grade. Because of the higher risk nature of our investments, we require board observation or informational rights and may require a board seat. 
 We may engage in various investment strategies to achieve our investment objectives based on the types of opportunities we discover and the competitive landscape. We expect to focus on current cash yields in order to achieve our income producing goals. 
 Our Investment Process 
 The investment process is comprised of the sourcing and qualifying of investment opportunities, evaluating and negotiating the investment vehicle, due diligence of the business plan, operations and prospects of the prospective investee and follow through investment monitoring, follow on investments and portfolio management. 
 RCMs investment team identifies investment opportunities through a network of investment referral relationships. Investment proposals may come to RCM or us from other sources, including unsolicited proposals from companies and referrals from accountants, bankers, lawyers and other members of the financial community. We believe that RCMs and our reputation and experience in the investment community provide a competitive advantage in originating quality investments. 
 In a typical private financing, RCMs investment team will review, analyze, and confirm, through due diligence, the business plan and operations of the potential portfolio company. Additionally, they will familiarize themselves with the portfolio companys industry and competition and may conduct reference checks with its customers and suppliers. RCMs investment committee will then review the deal and if approved, the transaction will be funded by Rand. 
 Following our initial investment, we may make follow-on investments to take advantage of warrants or other preferential rights granted to us to increase or maintain our position in a promising portfolio company, or provide additional funds to allow a portfolio company to fully implement its business plans, develop a new line of business or recover from unexpected business problems. Follow-on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated individually and may be subject to SBA restrictions.

 Disposition of Investments 
 We may exit investments through the maturation of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale, recapitalization, or initial public offering of a portfolio company. The method and timing of the disposition of our portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return. We generally expect to dispose of our equity securities through private sales of securities to other investors or through the sale or merger of the portfolio company. We anticipate our debt investments will be repaid with interest and may realize further appreciation from warrants or other equity type instruments received in connection with an investment. 
Current Portfolio Companies 
 For a description of our current portfolio company investments, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Composition of the Investment Portfolio. 
Competition 
 We compete for quality investments with other venture capital firms, individual investors, business development companies, and investment funds (including private equity funds and mezzanine funds), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks. We believe we are able to compete with these entities primarily on the basis of RCMs and our referral network, RCMs and our investing reputation and experience, RCMs responsive, quick, and efficient investment analysis and decision-making process and the investment terms we offer. 
 For information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Employees 
 We do not have any employees. Our operations are managed by RCM, our investment adviser and administrator, and each of our officers is an employee of RCM. RCM employed a total of four employees at December 31, 2020. We reimburse our administrator, RCM, for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations, on behalf of Rand, under the Administration Agreement. For a more detailed discussion of the administration agreement with RCM, see Administration Agreement. 
Investment Advisory and Management Agreement 
 RCM serves as our investment adviser (the Adviser) under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement. The Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Adviser manages the investment and reinvestment of our assets and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
 (i) determines the composition of Rands portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments; 
 (iii) executes, closes, services and monitors the investments; 
 (iv) determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell; 
 (v) performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and investments; 
 (vi) provides us with other investment advisory, research and related services that may, from time to time, be required for the investment of our assets, and 
 (vii) performs valuation of portfolio investments. 
 The Advisers services under the Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it may furnish similar services to other entities. In addition, subject to compliance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the 
 
4 


  Adviser is authorized to enter into one or more sub-advisory agreements with other investment advisors (each a Sub-Advisor), including for purposes of recommending specific securities or other investments based upon our investment objectives and policies, and working, along with the Adviser, in structuring, negotiating, arranging or effecting the acquisition or disposition of our investments and monitoring our investments. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser, and not us, will be responsible for any compensation that is payable to any Sub-Advisor.
About the Investment Process of the Adviser 
 The Advisers principal investment portfolio managers are Allen F. Grum and Daniel P. Penberthy, who manage the Corporations investment portfolio on a day-to-day basis. All decisions to acquire or dispose of assets on behalf of the Corporation are made by the Advisers investment committee (the Investment Committee). Each decision must be approved by a majority of Investment Committee members. 
 The Investment Committee was composed of five individuals during 2020 and increased to six individuals when James Morrow was added to the Investment Committee effective December 31, 2020 in connection with the Adviser Change in Control. As disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on January 4, 2021, Callodine acquired the controlling interest of RCM, from East on December 31, 2020. The Investment Committee currently consists of the following individuals: 
 

 | Scott Barfield;
--+----------------


 | Brian Collins;
--+---------------


 | Allen F. Grum;
--+---------------


 | Adam Gusky;
--+------------


 | James Morrow; and
--+------------------


 | Daniel P. Penberthy.
--+---------------------

 All potential investment opportunities undergo an initial informal review by Messrs. Grum and Penberthy, as the Advisers investment professionals. Each potential investment opportunity that an investment professional determines merits consideration is presented and evaluated at meetings in which the members of the Investment Committee discuss the merits and risks of each potential investment opportunity and the pricing and structure for the investment. 
 Fees Paid to Adviser 
 Under the Investment Management Agreement, we pay the Adviser, as compensation for the investment advisory and management services, fees consisting of two components: (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive Fees. 
Base Management Fee 
 The Base Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds), determined according to procedures duly adopted by the Board. 
 The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. 
 Incentive Fees 
 The Incentive Fees are comprised of two parts: (1) the Income Based Fee and (2) the Capital Gains Fee. 
 
5 


 Income Based Fee 
 The Income Based Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter and is payable promptly following the filing of our financial statements for such quarter. 
 For purposes of the Investment Management Agreement, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) we accrue during the relevant calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses for such calendar quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding any portion of Incentive Fee). 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment-in-kind interest, payment-in-kind dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that we have recognized in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, (GAAP), but have not yet received in cash (collectively, Accrued Unpaid Income). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized and unrealized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). We pay the Adviser an Incentive Fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 (i) no Income Based Fee in any quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized); 
 (ii) 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized) but is less than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized); and 
 (iii) 20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% (8.75% annualized). 
 However, the Income Based Fee paid to the Adviser for any calendar quarter that begins more than two years and three months after the effective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement shall not be in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap. The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (1) 20.0% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period (as defined below) minus (2) the aggregate Income Based Fee that was paid in respect of the calendar quarters included in the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. 
 For purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, Income Based Fee Calculation Period is defined as, with reference to a calendar quarter, the period of time consisting of such calendar quarter and the additional quarters that comprise the lesser of (1) the number of quarters immediately preceding such calendar quarter that began more than two years after the effective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement or (2) the eleven calendar quarters immediately preceding such calendar quarter. 
 For purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, Cumulative Net Return is defined as (1) the aggregate net investment income in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period minus (2) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, we pay no Income Based Fee to the Adviser for such quarter. If, in 
 
6 


  any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Income Based Fee that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we pay an Income Based Fee to the Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Income Based Fee that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we pay an Income Based Fee to the Adviser equal to the Income Based Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 For purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, Net Capital Loss, in respect of a particular period, means the difference, if positive, between (1) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (2) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 
 Any Income Based Fee otherwise payable under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income (such fees being the Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees) shall be deferred, on a security-by-security basis, and shall become payable to the Adviser only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received by us in respect of any Accrued Unpaid Income. Any Accrued Unpaid Income that is subsequently reversed by us in connection with a write-down, write-off, impairment, or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to such Accrued Unpaid Income will, in the applicable period of reversal, (1) reduce Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and (2) reduce the amount of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees. Subsequent payments of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees that are deferred shall not reduce the amounts otherwise payable for any quarter as an Income Based Fee. 
 Capital Gains Fee 
 The Capital Gains Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement). Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (2) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from the effective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement. If this amount is positive at the end of any calendar year, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee payable for that calendar year. If the Investment Management Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains Fee. 
 For purposes of the Capital Gains Fee: 
 

 | The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment shall mean, with respect to an investment owned by us as of the effective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement, the fair value of that investment as set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019, as filed with the SEC on November 7, 2019, and, with respect to an investment acquired by us subsequent to the effective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement or the Investment Management Agreement, the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment as reflected in the our financial statements.

 Example 1: Income Based Fee Calculations: * 
 Alternative 1
Assumptions: 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 
 Base Management Fee(2) = 0.375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income  (Base Management Fee + other expenses)) = 0.675% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no Income Based Fee is payable for the calendar quarter. 
 Alternative 2
Assumptions: 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 
 Base Management Fee(2) = 0.375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income  (Base Management Fee + other expenses)) = 2.125% 
 Income Based Fee (subject to catch up)(3) = 100.00% × (2.125%  1.75%) = 0.375% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the catch-up provision, therefore the Income Based Fee payable for the calendar quarter is 0.375%.
 Alternative 3
Assumptions: 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% 
 Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 
 Base Management Fee(2) = 0.375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income  (Base Management Fee + other expenses)) = 2.925% 
 Income Based Fee (subject to catch up)(3) = 100.00% × catch-up + (20.00% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income above 2.1875%)) 
 Catch-up = 2.1875%  1.75% = 0.4375% 
 Income Based Fee = (100.00% × .4375%) + (20.00% × (2.925%  2.1875%)) 
 = 0.4375% + (20.00% × 0.7375%) 
 = 0.4375% + 0.1475% 
 = 0.585% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the catch-up provision, therefore the Income Based Fee payable for the calendar quarter is 0.585%. 

* | For ease of review, (i) the hypothetical amounts of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, investment income, Base Management Fee, other expenses, and Income Based Fee are each expressed

as a percentage of total assets, though as described in greater detail above, each of these amounts are calculated as a numerical dollar amount as set forth in the Investment Management Agreement, (ii) the hypothetical amount of the Base Management Fee is assumed to be consistent from quarter to quarter, and (iii) these examples each assume that the Incentive Fee Cap is not yet in effect.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (1) Represents 7.00% annualized hurdle rate. 
 (2) Represents 1.50% annualized Base Management Fee. 
 (3) The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Adviser with an Income Based Fee of 20.00% on all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when Rands Pre-Incentive Net Investment Income exceeds 1.75% in any calendar quarter. 
Example 2: Capital Gains Fee Calculations: 
 Alternative 1
Assumptions: 
 

Year 1: | $20.0 million investment made in Company A (Investment A), and $30.0 million investment made in Company B (Investment B)
Year 2: | Investment A sold for $50.0 million and fair market value (FMV) of Investment B determined to be $32.0 million 
Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million 
Year 4: | Investment B sold for $31.0 million 

 The Capital Gains Fees, if any, would be calculated as follows: 
 

Year 1: | None 
Year 2: | Capital Gains Fee of $6.0 million  ($30.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%) 
Year 3: | None  $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30.0 million cumulative capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6.0 million (previous Capital Gains Fee paid in Year 2)
Year 4: | Capital Gains Fee of $0.2 million  $6.2 million ($31.0 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $6.0 million (Capital Gains Fee taken in Year 2) 

 Alternative 2
Assumptions: 
 

Year 1: | $20.0 million investment made in Company A (Investment A), $30.0 million investment made in Company B (Investment B) and $25.0 million investment made in Company C (Investment C)
Year 2: | Investment A sold for $50.0 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25.0 million 
Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $27.0 million and Investment C sold for $30.0 million 
Year 4: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $35.0 million 
Year 5: | Investment B sold for $20.0 million 

 The Capital Gains Fees, if any, would be calculated as follows:

 Indemnification under the Investment Management Agreement 
 The Investment Management Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Adviser, its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person affiliated with any of them (collectively, the Indemnified Parties), are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of us or our security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Advisers duties or obligations under the Investment Management Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser. 
Duration and Termination 
 The Investment Management Agreement was executed on December 31, 2020 and will remain in effect for two years after this date. Our Board approved the Investment Management Agreement on October 29, 2020 and it was approved by our shareholders at the Special Meeting held on December 16, 2020. Thereafter, the Investment Management Agreement will continue to renew automatically for successive annual periods so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by: 
 (i) the vote of our Board, or by the vote of shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Rand; and 
 (ii) the vote of a majority of our independent directors, in either case, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. 
 The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon sixty days written notice, by: (a) by vote of a majority of the Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Rand (as defined in the 1940 Act); or (b) the Adviser. Furthermore, the Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 15(a)(4) of the 1940 Act). See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur investment adviser and administrator, RCM, has the right to resign on sixty days notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser will be entitled to any amounts owed as payment of the Base Management Fees and the Incentive Fees through the date of termination or expiration. 
 Administration Agreement 
 In connection with the Closing, we entered into the Prior Administration Agreement with the Adviser, and on December 31, 2020, concurrent with the execution of the Investment Management Agreement, we entered into the Administration Agreement with the Adviser. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser agreed to perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operations, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as the Adviser, subject to review by the Board, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. The Adviser will also, on our behalf, arrange for the services of, and oversee, custodians, depositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other shareholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks, and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable. The Adviser makes reports to our Board regarding the performance of its obligations under the Administration Agreement and furnishes advice and recommendations with respect to such other aspects of our business and affairs as it determines to be desirable. 
 
11 


 The Adviser is responsible for our financial and other records that are required to be maintained and prepares all reports and other materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority, including reports to shareholders. In addition, the Adviser assists us in determining and publishing our Net Asset Value (NAV), overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and the printing and dissemination of reports to shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. The Adviser provides, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. 
 In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Adviser, we will reimburse the Adviser for the costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities. Costs and expenses to be paid by us include those relating to: organization; calculating NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); expenses incurred by the Adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on its prospective portfolio companies; interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; offerings of our common stock and other securities; investment advisory and management fees (other than fees (if any) payable to a sub-advisor retained by the Adviser under the Investment Management Agreement); administration fees; transfer agent and custodial fees; federal and state registration fees; all costs of registration and listing our common stock on any securities exchange; federal, state, local and other taxes; independent directors fees and expenses; costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies (including the SEC); costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to shareholders, including printing costs; our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; direct costs and expenses of administration, including independent auditors and outside legal costs; and all other expenses incurred by us or the Adviser in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the Advisers overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent (if office space is provided by the Adviser) and our allocable portion of the cost of the chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs (including travel expenses). 
 The Administration Agreement was executed on December 31, 2020, the same date as the Investment Management Agreement, and will remain in effect for two years, and thereafter will continue automatically for successive annual periods so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the Board, including a majority of the independent directors. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of our directors, or by the Adviser, upon 60 days written notice to the other party. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other party. 
 Regulations 
 The following discussion is a general summary of the material prohibitions and descriptions governing BDCs and SBA-licensed SBICs. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs and SBICs. 
Business Development Company Regulations 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Although the 1940 Act exempts a BDC from registration under the 1940 Act, the 1940 Act contains significant limitations on the operations of BDCs. Among other things, the 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a BDC and its affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of its affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act also prohibits a BDC from changing the nature of its business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw its election as, a BDC unless so authorized by a vote of the holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities. BDCs are not required to maintain fundamental investment policies relating to diversification and concentration of investments within a single industry. More specifically, in order to qualify as a BDC, a company must: 
 (1) be a domestic company; 
 
12 


 (2) have registered a class of its equity securities or have filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act); 
 (3) operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of companies, namely immature or emerging companies and businesses suffering or just recovering from financial distress. Generally, a BDC must be primarily engaged in the business of furnishing capital and providing managerial expertise to companies that do not have ready access to capital through conventional financial channels. Such companies are termed eligible portfolio companies; 
 (4) extend significant managerial assistance to such portfolio companies; and 
 (5) have a majority of disinterested directors (as defined in the 1940 Act). 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of their total assets. An eligible portfolio company is, generally, a private domestic operating company, or a public domestic operating company whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange. In addition, any small business investment company that is licensed by the SBA and is a wholly owned subsidiary of a BDC is an eligible portfolio company. 
 Qualifying assets include: 
 (1) securities of companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time the BDC acquired their securities; 
 (2) securities of bankrupt or insolvent companies that were eligible at the time of the BDCs initial acquisition of their securities but are no longer eligible, provided that the BDC has maintained a substantial portion of its initial investment in those companies; 
 (3) securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to any of the foregoing; and 
 (4) cash items, government securities and high-quality short-term debt. 
 The 1940 Act also places restrictions on the nature of the transactions in which, and the persons from whom, securities can be purchased in order for the securities to be considered qualifying assets. 
 A BDC is permitted to invest in the securities of public companies and other investments that are not qualifying assets, but those kinds of investments may not exceed 30% of the BDCs total asset value at the time of the investment. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with this rule. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for purposes of the 70% test discussed above, a BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases the securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio companys officers or other organizational or financial guidance. 
Small Business Investment Company Regulations 
 SBA Lending Restrictions 
 SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private debt and/or equity capital to small businesses. The types and dollar amounts of the loans and other investments we may make are limited by the 1940 Act, the Small 
 
13 


  Business Act (the SBA Act) and SBA regulations. Rand SBIC uses funds borrowed from the SBA that can be combined with our own capital to provide loans to, and make equity investments in, businesses that meet the following criteria: 
 (a) have a tangible net worth not in excess of $19.5 million and average net income after U.S. federal income taxes for the preceding two completed fiscal years not in excess of $6.5 million, or 
 (b) meet size standards set by the SBA that are measured by either annual receipts or number of employees, depending on the industry in which the businesses are primarily engaged. 
 In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, an SBIC must have at least 20% to 25% (depending on what year the investment was made) in total dollars invested in smaller enterprises. The SBA defines smaller enterprises as businesses that: 
 (a) do not have a net worth in excess of $6 million and have average net income after U.S. federal income taxes for the preceding two years no greater than $2 million, or 
 (b) meet size standards set by the SBA that are measured by either annual receipts or number of employees, depending on the industry in which the concerns are primarily engaged. 
 We have complied with these requirements since the inception of Rand SBIC. 
 The SBA prohibits an SBIC from providing funds to small businesses with specific characteristics, such as businesses with the majority of their employees located outside the United States, or from investing in passive or non-operating businesses, real estate, project financing, farmland, or financial lenders. Without prior SBA approval, an SBIC may not invest an amount equal to more than approximately 30% of the SBICs regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates. 
 The SBA places limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies such as limiting the prepayment options, the financing fees that can be charged to a portfolio company, the allowable interest rate on loan and debt securities that an SBIC can charge a portfolio company, and the maximum term of such financing. An SBIC may exercise control over a small business for a period of up to seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. 
 The SBA restricts the ability of an SBIC to lend money to any of its officers, directors, and employees or to invest in associates. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a change of control of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person, or a group of persons acting together, owning 10% or more of a class of capital stock of a licensed SBIC. A change of control is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise. Rand SBIC received approval from the SBA in October 2019 for purposes of completing the stock sale transaction between Rand Capital Corporation and East. 
 Rand SBIC may invest directly in a portfolio companys equity but may not become a general partner of a non-incorporated entity or otherwise become jointly or severally liable for the general obligations of a non-incorporated entity. Rand SBIC may acquire options or warrants in portfolio companies, and the options or warrants may have redemption provisions, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to SBA regulations, the maximum cash which may be invested in any one portfolio company by Rand SBIC is currently $4.8 million. 
 In addition, the SBA regulations require an examination of a licensed SBIC by an SBA examiner to determine the SBICs compliance with the relevant SBA regulations. Our annual report, submitted to the SBA, must be audited by an independent public accounting firm. 
 SBA Leverage 
 The SBA raises capital to enable it to provide funds to SBICs by guaranteeing certificates or bonds that are pooled and sold to purchasers of the government guaranteed securities. The amount of funds that the SBA may lend to SBICs is determined by annual Congressional appropriations. 
 SBA debentures are issued with ten-year maturities. Interest only is payable semi-annually until maturity. All of our outstanding SBA debentures may be prepaid without penalty. To reserve the approved SBA debenture 
 
14 


  leverage, we paid an upfront 1% commitment fee to the SBA as a partial prepayment of the SBAs nonrefundable 3% leverage fee. These fees are expensed over the life of the corresponding SBA debenture instruments. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to Rand SBICs assets over our shareholders in the event we liquidate Rand SBIC, or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by Rand SBIC upon an event of default. 
 At December 31, 2020, we had $11,000,000 in outstanding SBA debenture instruments. 
 Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
 The Corporation intends to elect U.S. federal tax treatment as a RIC as of January 1, 2020 on our timely filed U.S. Federal tax return for the 2020 tax year. In order to qualify to make the RIC Election, we must, among other things, distribute our previously undistributed accumulated earnings and profits to shareholders, which we accomplished through the special dividend paid to shareholders in May 2020. RIC qualification also requires meeting specified source-of-income and asset-diversification requirements. In addition, we must distribute to our shareholders, with respect of each taxable year, dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, which is generally equal to the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid (the Annual Distribution Requirement). As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes. 
 In connection with making the RIC election, we expect that Rand SBIC will also make an election to be taxed as a RIC for U.S. federal tax purposes. In order to be eligible to be taxed as a RIC, Rand SBIC must satisfy the source-of-income, asset-diversification, and minimum distribution requirements discussed above. Because a substantial portion of our assets are held in Rand SBIC, we may not be able to satisfy the asset-diversification requirements unless Rand SBIC also qualifies to be taxed as a RIC for U.S. federal tax purposes. 
 Assuming that we qualify to be taxed as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which is defined as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that is timely distributed to shareholders. Similarly, assuming that Rand SBIC qualifies to be taxed as a RIC and satisfies the Annual Distribution Requirement, Rand SBIC will also not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain that it timely distributes to Rand Capital Corporation. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders. Rand SBIC will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to Rand Capital Corporation. Additionally, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income earned on certain investments that need to remain in a taxable subsidiary in order to maintain RIC status. 
 Rand and Rand SBIC, respectively, will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless each distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 (1) 98% of its ordinary income for each calendar year, 
 (2) 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year, and 
 (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which it paid no U.S. federal income tax. 
 In order to maintain qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes going forward, Rand and Rand SBIC must each, among other things: 
 (1) meet the Annual Distribution Requirement; 
 
15 


 (2) qualify to be regulated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act; 
 (3) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code); and 
 (4) diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 (a) at least 50% of the value of its assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of its assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a qualified publicly-traded partnership); and 
 (b) no more than 25% of the value of its assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships. 
 Because a substantial portion of Rand Capital Corporations assets consist of its shares in Rand SBIC, we will not be eligible to be taxed as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless Rand SBIC is also eligible to be taxed as a RIC for U.S. federal tax purposes. 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that have original issue discount (OID) or debt instruments with payment-in-kind (PIK) interest, we must include in income, each year, a portion of this non-cash income that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash is received by us in that taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any OID income or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash. 
 Even if Rand and Rand SBIC qualify for taxation as RICs, they will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in their respective assets as of the first day they qualify as RICs to the extent that such gains are realized by them during the five-year period following the first day that they qualify as RICs. As of December 31, 2020, neither Rand nor Rand SBIC have unrealized net built-in gains. 
 If Rand and Rand SBIC qualify for taxation as RICs, distributions out of our earnings and profits to shareholders generally will be taxable to shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either as ordinary income or capital gains, depending upon the nature of the income giving rise to the distribution. The tax consequences to a shareholder attributable to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common stock, are complex and will depend on the facts of the shareholders unique circumstances.
