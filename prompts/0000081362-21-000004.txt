Item 1.Business.

General Description 
The Company was organized in 1918, incorporated
as a Pennsylvania business corporation in 1930,
and in August 2019 
completed
the Combination with Houghton to form Quaker Houghton.
Quaker Houghton is a global leader in industrial process 
fluids.
With a presence around the world,
including operations in over 25 countries, the Company’s
customers include thousands of 
the world’s most advanced
and specialized steel, aluminum, automotive, aerospace,
offshore, can, mining, and metalworking 
companies. Quaker Houghton develops, produces, and
markets a broad range of formulated chemical specialty
products and offers 
chemical management services (which we refer to as “Fluidcare
TM
”) for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications 
throughout its four segments: Americas; Europe, Middle
East and Africa (“EMEA”); Asia/Pacific; and Global Specialty
Businesses. 
The major product lines of Quaker Houghton include
metal removal fluids, cleaning fluids, corrosion inhibitors, metal
drawing 
and forming fluids, die cast mold releases, heat treatment
and quenchants, metal forging fluids, hydraulic fluids,
specialty greases, 
offshore sub-sea energy control fluids,
rolling lubricants, rod and wire drawing fluids and surface treatme
nt chemicals.
The following 
are the respective contributions to consolidated net sales of
each of our principal product lines representing more than 10% of 
consolidated net sales for
any of the past three years based on the Company’s

Houghton Combination 
On August 1, 2019, the Company completed the Combination
and acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Houghton 
from Gulf Houghton Lubricants, Ltd. (“Gulf”) and certain other
selling shareholders in exchange for a combination of cash and
shares 
of the Company’s common
stock in accordance with the share purchase agreement dated
April 4, 2017 (the “Share Purchase 
Agreement”).
The shares were bought for an aggregate purchase consideration
consisting of: (i) $170.8 million in cash; (ii) the 
issuance of approximately 4.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock, $1.00
par value per share, comprising 24.5% of the 
common stock outstanding upon the closing of the Combination;
and (iii) the Company’s refinancing
of Houghton’s net indebtedness 
as of the closing of the Combination of approximately
$702.6 million.
Houghton is a leading global provider of specialty chemicals and
technical services for metalworking and other industrial 
applications, and, the combination with Legacy Quaker
created a leading global supplier of industrial process fluids.
The 
Combination expanded the Company’s
addressable metalworking, metals and industrial end markets, including
steel, aluminum, 
aerospace, defense, transportation-original equipment
manufacturer (“OEM”), transportation-components, offshore
sub-sea energy, 
architectural aluminum, construction, tube and pipe,
can and container, mining, specialty coatings
and specialty greases.
The 
Combination also strengthened the product portfolio of the
combined Company.
Notable Recent Acquisition Activity 
In December 2020, the Company completed its acquisition
of Coral Chemical Company (“Coral”), a privately held,
U.S.-based 
provider of metal finishing fluid solutions, for approximately
$53 million, net of cash acquired.
Coral provides technical expertise and 
product solutions for pre-treatment, metalworking and wastewater
treatment applications to the beverage can and general industrial 
end markets.
In February 2021, the Company acquired certain assets related to
tin-plating solutions primarily for steel end markets for 
approximately $25 million. 
Impact of COVID-19 
During 2020, the global outbreak of COVID-19 and
subsequent pandemic negatively impacted all locations where
the Company 
does business.
Although the Company has now operated during several
quarters in this COVID-19 environment, the full extent of
the 
pandemic and related business impacts remains
uncertain and volatile, and therefore the full extent to which
COVID-19 may impact 
the Company’s future
results of operations or financial condition is uncertain.
The pandemic has disrupted the operations of the 
Company and its suppliers and customers and, as a result,
the Company experienced volume declines and lower net sales during
2020 
as further described in Item 7 of this Report.
The initial impact was at its China subsidiaries in the first quarter
of 2020 and beginning 


  
3 
in late March continued throughout 2020 in the rest of
the business as the pandemic led to a global economic slowdown.
Management 
continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the Company,
the overall specialty chemical industry and the 
economies and markets in which the Company operates.

Sales Revenue 
A substantial portion of the Company’s
sales worldwide are made directly through its own employees
and its Fluidcare programs, 
with the balance sold through distributors and agents.
The Company’s employees typically
visit the plants of customers regularly, 
work on site, and through training and experience,
identify production needs which can be resolved or otherwise addressed
either by 
utilizing the Company’s
existing products or by applying new formulations developed
in its laboratories.
The Company recognizes revenue in an amount that
reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive
in exchange 
for the goods or services transferred to its customers.
To do this, the Company
applies a five-step model that requires the Company 
to: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify
the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the
transaction 
price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when
,
or as, the 
Company satisfies a performance obligation. 
As part of the Company’s
Fluidcare business, certain third-party product sales to customers are
managed by the Company.
Where 
the Company acts as principal, revenues are recognized
on a gross reporting basis at the selling price negotiated
with its customers.
Where the Company acts as an agent, revenue is recognized on
a net reporting basis at the amount of the administrative fee earned
by 
the Company for ordering the goods.
The Company transferred third-party products under arrangements resulting
in net reporting of 
$42.5 million,
$48.0 million and $47.1 million for the years ended December
31, 2020,
2019 and 2018,
respectively. 
Competition 
The specialty chemical industry comprises a number
of companies similar in size to the Company,
as well as companies larger 
and smaller than Quaker Houghton.
The Company cannot readily determine its precise position in
every industry it serves.
However, 
the Company estimates it holds a leading global position
in the market for industrial process fluids including significant
global 
positions in the markets for process fluids in portions of
the automotive and industrial markets, and a leading position in
the market for 
process fluids to produce sheet steel and aluminum.
The offerings of many of the Company’s
competitors differ from those of Quaker 
Houghton; some offer a broad portfolio of
fluids, including general lubricants, while others have more
specialized product ranges.
All 
competitors provide different levels of technical
services to individual customers.
Competition in the industry is based primarily on 
the ability to supply products that meet the needs of the
customer and provide technical services and laboratory assistance
to the 
customer, and to a lesser extent, on
price. 
Major Customers and Markets 
In 2020,
Quaker Houghton’s five largest
customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions
with semi-autonomous 
purchasing authority) accounted for approximately
10% of consolidated net sales, with its largest customer
accounting for 
approximately 3% of consolidated net sales.
A significant portion of the Company’s
revenues are realized from the sale of process 
fluids and services to manufacturers of steel, aluminum,
automobiles, aircraft, industrial equipment, and durable goods and,
therefore, 
Quaker
Houghton is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced
by these manufacturers and their customers.
The 
Company’s financial performance
is generally correlated to the volume of global production
within the industries it serves, rather than 
directly related to the financial performance of its customers.
Furthermore, steel and aluminum customers typically have limited 
manufacturing locations compared to metalworking
customers and generally use higher volumes of products at a single
location. 
Raw Materials

Quaker Houghton uses approximately 3,000 raw materials,
including animal fats, vegetable oils, mineral oils, oleochemicals, 
ethylene, solvents, surfactant agents, various chemical compounds
that act as additives to our base formulations, and a wide variety
of 
other organic and inorganic compounds
and various derivatives of the foregoing.
The price of mineral oil and its derivatives can be 
affected by the price of crude oil and industry
refining capacity.
Animal fat and vegetable oil prices, as well as the prices of
other raw 
materials, are impacted by their own unique supply
and demand factors, and by biodiesel consumption which
is affected by the price 
of crude oil.
Accordingly, significant fluctuations
in the price of crude oil can have a material impact on
the cost of these raw 
materials.
In addition, many of the raw materials used by Quaker
Houghton are commodity chemicals which can experience 
significant price volatility.
Accordingly, the
Company’s earnings could be
affected by market changes in raw material prices.
Reference is made to the disclosure contained in Item 7A
of this Report. 
Patents and Trademarks 
Quaker Houghton has a limited number of patents and patent
applications including patents issued, applied for,
or acquired in the 
U.S. and in various foreign countries, some of which may
prove to be material to its business, with the earliest patent expiry
in 2021.
The Company principally relies on its proprietary formulae
and its applications know-how and experience to meet
customer needs.
Quaker Houghton products are identified by numerous trademarks
that are registered throughout its marketing area.

Research and Development—Laboratories 
The Company maintains approximately thirty separate laboratory
facilities worldwide that are primarily devoted to applied 
research and development.
In addition, the Company maintains quality control labs at
each of its manufacturing facilities.
Quaker 
Houghton research and development is directed primarily
toward applied technology since the nature of the Company’s
business 
requires continual modification and improvement of formulations
to provide specialty chemicals to satisfy customer requirements.
If 
problems are encountered which cannot be resolved
by local laboratories, the problem is referred to one of our ten principal 
laboratories, located in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania; Aurora, Illinois; Santa Fe Springs,
California; 
Uithoorn, the Netherlands; Coventry,
United Kingdom; Dortmund, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Turin,
Italy or Qingpu, China. 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Research and development expenses during the years ended 
December 31, 2020,
2019 and 2018 were $40.0 million,
$32.1 million and $24.5 million, respectively. 
Regulatory Matters 
In order to facilitate compliance with applicable federal,
state, and local statutes and regulations relating to occupational
health 
and safety and protection of the environment, the Company
has an ongoing program of site assessment for the
purpose of identifying 
capital expenditures or other actions that may be
necessary to comply with such requirements.
The program includes periodic 
inspections of each facility by the Company and/or independent
experts, as well as ongoing inspections and training by on-site 
personnel.
Such inspections address operational matters, record keeping, reporting
requirements and capital improvements.
Capital 
expenditures directed solely or primarily to regulatory
compliance amounted to approximately $3.7

million, $4.4 million and $1.5 
million during the years ended December 31, 2020,
2019 and 2018,
respectively. 
Company Segmentation 
The Company’s operating
segments, which are consistent with its reportable segments,
reflect the structure of the Company’s 
internal organization, the method by which
the Company’s resources are allocated

chief operating decision maker assess performance.
The Company’s reportable segments
are: (i) Americas; (ii) EMEA; (iii) 
Asia/Pacific; and (iv) Global Specialty Businesses.
See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8 of this Report, 
incorporated herein by this reference. 
Non-U.S. Activities 
Since significant revenues and earnings are generated by
non-U.S. operations, the Company’s
financial results are affected by 
currency fluctuations, particularly between the U.S.
dollar and the euro, the British pound sterling, the Brazilian
real, the Mexican 
peso, the Chinese renminbi and the Indian rupee,
and the impact of those currency fluctuations on the underlying economies.

Factors that May Affect Our Future
Results 
(Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995) 
Certain information included in this Report and other
materials filed or to be filed by Quaker Chemical Corporation
with the SEC 
(as well as information included in oral statements or other
written statements made or to be made by us) contain
or may contain 
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These statements can be identified by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to 
historical or current facts.
We have based
these forward-looking statements, including statements regarding
the potential effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s
business, results of operation, and financial condition, and our expectations
that we will 
maintain sufficient liquidity and remediate any
of our material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting on our current 
expectations about future events. 
These forward-looking statements include statements with respect
to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, 
anticipations, intentions, financial condition, results of operations,
future performance, and business, including: 

• 

the potential benefits of the Combination and other acquisitions; 

• 

the impacts on our business as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and any projected global economic rebound
or 
anticipated positive results due to Company actions taken
in response to the pandemic; 

• 

our current and future results and plans; and 

• 

statements that include the words “may,”
“could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” 
“intend,” “plan” or similar expressions. 
Such statements include information relating to current and
future business activities, operational matters, capital spending,
and 
financing sources.
From time to time, forward-looking statements are also included in
the Company’s other periodic
reports on Forms 
10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, press releases, and other materials released
to, or statements made to, the public. 
Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Report,
in the Company’s Annual
Report to Shareholders for 2020 and in any 
other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong.
This can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions
or as a consequence 
of known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Many factors discussed in this Report will be important in determining
our future 
performance.
Consequently, actual results may
differ materially from those that might be anticipated
from our forward-looking 
statements. 

  
6 
We undertake
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise.
However, any further disclosures made
on related subjects in the Company’s
subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 
10-Q, 8-K and other related filings should be consulted.
A major risk is that demand for the Company’s
products and services is 
largely derived from the demand for our customers’
products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related
to downturns in a 
customer’s business and unanticipated customer
production shutdowns.
Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not 
limited to, the primary and secondary impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic including actions taken in response to the pandemic by 
various governments, which could exacerbate some
or all of the other risks and uncertainties faced by the Company,
including the 
potential for significant increases in raw material costs, supply
chain disruptions, customer financial instability,
worldwide economic 
and political disruptions, foreign currency fluctuations,
significant changes in applicable tax rates and regulations,
future terrorist 
attacks and other acts of violence, each of which
is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A of this Report.
Furthermore, the Company is 
subject to the same business cycles as those experienced
by our customers in the steel, automobile, aircraft, industrial
equipment, and 
durable goods industries.
The ultimate significance of COVID-19 impacts on our business will depend
on, among other things, the 
extent and duration of the pandemic, the severity of the
disease and the number of people infected with the
virus, the continued 
uncertainty regarding availability,
administration and long-term efficacy of a
vaccine, or other treatments, including on new strands or 
mutations of the virus, the longer term effects on
the economy, including
the resulting market volatility,
and the measures taken by 
governmental authorities and other
third parties restricting day-to-day life and business operations
and the length of time that such 
measures remain in place, as well as laws and other governmental
programs implemented to address the pandemic or assist impacted 
businesses, such as fiscal stimulus and other legislation
designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief.
Other factors could also 
adversely affect us, including those related to
the Combination and other acquisitions and the integration of
the acquired businesses.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties
and assumptions about the Company and its operations
that are 
subject to change based on various important factors,
some of which are beyond our control.
These risks, uncertainties, and possibly 
inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could
cause our actual results to differ materially from expected
and historical results.
Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance
on our forward-looking statements.
For more information regarding these 
risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional
risks that we face, refer to the Risk Factors section in Item
1A of this Report, and 
in our quarterly and other reports filed from time
to time with the SEC.
This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private 
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
