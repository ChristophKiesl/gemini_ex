OUR OPERATIONS

We have three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. We provide a range of services to the oil and gas and renewable energy markets primarily in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions. Our Well Intervention segment includes our vessels and/or equipment used to access offshore wells for the purpose of performing well enhancement or decommissioning operations. Our well intervention vessels include the Q4000, the Q5000, the Q7000, the Seawell, the Well Enhancer, and two chartered monohull vessels, the Siem Helix  and the Siem Helix . Our well intervention equipment includes intervention riser systems (“IRSs”), subsea intervention lubricators (“SILs”) and the Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (“ROAM”), some of which we provide on a stand-alone basis. Our Robotics segment includes remotely operated vehicles (“ROVs”), trenchers and a ROVDrill, which are designed to complement well intervention services and offshore construction to both the oil and gas and the renewable energy markets globally. Our Robotics segment also includes two robotics support vessels under long-term charter, the Grand Canyon II and the Grand Canyon III, as well as spot vessels as needed. Our Production Facilities segment includes the Helix Producer I (the “HP I”), a ship-shaped dynamically positioned floating production vessel, the Helix Fast Response System (the “HFRS”) and our ownership of oil and gas properties. All of our current Production Facilities activities are located in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 15 for financial results related to our business segments.

Well Intervention

We engineer, manage and conduct well intervention operations, which include production enhancement and abandonment, and construction operations in water depths ranging from 200 to 10,000 feet. As major and independent oil and gas companies develop deepwater reserves, we expect the number of subsea trees to increase, which can improve long-term demand for well intervention services. Historically, drilling rigs were used in subsea well intervention to troubleshoot or enhance production, shift sleeves, log wells or perform recompletions. Our well intervention vessels serve as work platforms for well intervention services at costs that generally have been less than those of offshore drilling rigs. Our vessels derive competitive advantages from their lower operating costs, with an ability to mobilize quickly and to maximize operational time by performing a broad range of tasks related to intervention, construction, inspection, repair and maintenance. Our services provide a cost advantage in the development and management of subsea reservoirs. We believe we offer efficiency gains from our specialized intervention assets.

Our well intervention business currently operates seven vessels and various equipment such as IRSs, SILs and the ROAM, providing services primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, the North Sea and West Africa.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the Q4000, a riser-based semi-submersible well intervention vessel, has been serving customers in the spot market since 2002. In 2010, the Q4000 served as a key emergency response vessel in the Macondo well control and containment efforts. The Q5000 riser-based semi-submersible well intervention vessel commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015 and is under a five-year contract with BP expiring in the first half of 2021.

In Brazil, we provide well intervention services to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”) with the Siem Helix  and Siem Helix  vessels that we charter from Siem Offshore AS (“Siem”). The initial term of the agreements with Petrobras is for four years, with options to extend by agreement of both parties for an additional period of up to four years. The Siem Helix  commenced operations for Petrobras in April 2017 and the Siem Helix  commenced operations for Petrobras in December 2017. The initial term of the charter agreements with Siem is for seven years with options to extend.

In the North Sea, the Well Enhancer has performed well intervention, abandonment and coil tubing services since it joined our fleet in 2009. The Seawell has provided well intervention and abandonment services since 1987, and the vessel underwent major capital upgrades in 2015 to extend its estimated useful economic life by approximately 15 years.

The Q7000, a semi-submersible well intervention vessel built to U.K. North Sea standards and capable of working globally, commenced operations in January 2020 and is currently performing integrated well intervention operations offshore Nigeria.

Our alliance with Schlumberger leverages the parties’ capabilities to provide a unique, fully integrated offering to clients, combining marine support with well access and control technologies. Through our alliance, we and Schlumberger jointly developed a 15K IRS and the ROAM, which are currently available to customers.

Robotics

We have been actively engaged in robotics for over three decades. We operate robotics assets to complement offshore construction, maintenance and well intervention services for the oil and gas market and to support offshore renewable energy projects for the renewable energy market. We often integrate our services with chartered vessels. Our robotics business primarily operates in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, West Africa and Asia Pacific regions. As global marine construction activity levels increase and as the complexity and water depths of the facilities increase, the use and scope of robotics services has expanded. Our robotics assets and experience, coupled with our chartered vessel fleet and schedule flexibility, allow us to meet the technological challenges of our customers’ subsea activities worldwide. As of December 31, 2020, our robotics assets included 44 ROVs, four trenchers and one ROVDrill. We charter vessels on a long-term or a spot basis to support deployment of our robotics assets.

Over the last decade and especially in recent years there has been an increase in offshore activity associated with the growing renewable energy market. As the level of activity for offshore renewable energy projects, including wind farm projects, has increased, so has the need for reliable services and related equipment. Historically, this work was performed by barges and other similar vessels, but these types of services are increasingly being contracted to vessels more suitable for harsh offshore weather conditions, especially in Northern Europe where offshore wind farming is currently concentrated. We provide burial services related to subsea power cable installations as well as seabed clearing services around the world using our chartered vessels, ROVs and trenchers. In 2020, revenues derived from offshore renewable energy contracts accounted for 41% of our global Robotics segment revenues. We believe that over the long term our robotics business is positioned to continue providing services to a range of clients in the renewable energy market.

Production Facilities

We own the HP I, a ship-shaped dynamically positioned floating production vessel capable of processing up to 45,000 barrels of oil and 80 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The HP I has been under contract to the Phoenix field operator since February 2013 and is currently under a fixed fee agreement through at least June 1, 2023.

We developed the HFRS in 2011 as a culmination of our experience as a responder in the 2010 Macondo well control and containment efforts. The HFRS combines the HP I, the Q4000 and the Q5000 with certain well control equipment that can be deployed to respond to a well control incident. We are under agreement through September 30, 2021 with various operators to provide access to the HFRS for well control purposes.

Our Production Facilities segment includes two remaining wells acquired from Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”) in January 2019. These oil and gas properties are associated with the Droshky Prospect located in offshore Gulf of Mexico Green Canyon Block 244. As part of the transaction, Marathon Oil agreed to pay us certain amounts as we complete the P&A work.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

We primarily operate in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions. Our North Sea operations are subject to seasonal changes in demand, which generally peaks in the summer months and declines in the winter months. See Note 15 for revenues as well as property and equipment by geographic location.
CUSTOMERS

Our customers consist primarily of major and independent oil and gas producers and suppliers, pipeline transmission companies, renewable energy companies and offshore engineering and construction firms. The level of services required by any particular customer depends, in part, on the size of that customer’s budget in a particular year. Consequently, a customer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent fiscal years. The percentages of consolidated revenues from major customers (those representing 10% or more of our consolidated revenues) are as follows: 2020 — Petrobras (28%) and BP (17%); 2019 — Petrobras (29%), BP (15%) and Shell (13%); and 2018 — Petrobras (28%) and BP (15%). We provided services to over 50 customers in 2020.
COMPETITORS

The oilfield services and renewable energy services markets are highly competitive. Price and the ability to access specialized vessels, attract and retain skilled personnel, and operate safely are important factors to competing in these markets. Our principal competitors in well intervention include Baker Hughes, C-Innovation, Expro, Oceaneering, TIOS and international drilling contractors. Our principal competitors in the robotics business include C-Innovation, DeepOcean, DOF Subsea, Fugro, Oceaneering and ROVOP. Our principal competitors in renewable energy services include UTROV, Briggs Marine, James Fisher and Atlantic Marine. Our competitors may have more or differing financial, personnel, technological and other resources available to them.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE

We continue to implement and improve Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives and disclosures throughout our business. We understand we have an important role to play as a steward of the people, communities and environments we serve, and we regularly look for ways to emphasize and improve our own ESG record. We incorporate ESG initiatives into our core business values and priorities of safety, sustainability and value creation with a top-down approach led by management and our Board of Directors (our “Board”). Specifically, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board oversees, assesses and reviews the disclosure and reporting of any matters, including with respect to climate change, regarding the Company’s business and industry, and that committee's charter formally incorporates oversight of ESG matters as a stated responsibility.

We emphasize constant improvement by continually striving to improve our safety record, reducing our environmental impact, and increasing transparency. In 2020, we maintained a low Total Recordable Incident Rate and expanded our business with renewable energy customers. Our efforts are published in our Corporate Sustainability Report and Corporate Sustainability Summary Update, copies of which are available on our website at www.HelixESG.com/about-helix/corporate-sustainability.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

Labor Practices

As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,536 employees. Of our total employees, we had 336 non-U.S. employees covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements. We consider our overall relationships with our employees to be satisfactory. Further, we expect all employees to maintain a work environment free from harassment, discrimination and abuse, and one where employees treat each other with respect, dignity and courtesy.

Anti-Slavery and Anti-Human Trafficking

We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our workplace policies and procedures demonstrate our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to prevent slavery and human trafficking from taking place anywhere in our supply chains. In 2020, we implemented Anti-Human Trafficking training for employees to further arm our workforce with the tools to spot and prevent human trafficking. Our Modern Slavery Statement is available on our website, located at https://www.helixesg.com/modern-slavery-statement.

Employee Health and Safety

Our corporate vision of a zero-incident workplace is based on the belief that all incidents are preventable and that we manage our working conditions to eliminate unsafe behavior. We have established a corporate culture in which QHSE takes priority over our other business objectives. Everyone at Helix has the authority and the duty to “STOP WORK” they believe is unsafe. Helix management actively encourages critical safety behaviors and employees to work in compliance with our goals to avoid injuries to people, environmental disturbances and damage to assets. Our QHSE management systems and training programs were developed based on common industry work practices, and by employees with on-site experience who understand the risk and physical challenges of the offshore work environment. The management systems of our business units have been independently assessed and registered compliant with ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems). Our safety management systems were created in accordance with OHSAS 18001.

Health and Safety during COVID-19

The nature of offshore operations requires our offshore crew members as well as our customers and vendors to periodically travel to and from vessels. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced challenges unlike any we have ever seen, and while we like everyone else have not been immune to the impact of the pandemic, our personnel have risen to the occasion. We implemented numerous health and safety protocols in response to the pandemic, including personnel isolation and health screenings prior to travel and crew changes, a rigorous testing regime for all offshore personnel, limiting or altogether eliminating certain common areas aboard our vessels, mandatory face coverings, social distancing, extending the duration of certain offshore shifts to reduce travel and turnover, deep cleanings of our onshore facilities and offshore assets, and immediate quarantine and definitive response protocols in the event any personnel are showing or reporting any potential symptoms. With these measures in place to protect our personnel, those partners with whom we work and their collective families, we have thus far managed to avoid major operational downtime related to the pandemic.

Employee Engagement, Diversity and Inclusion

Employee Tenure and Turnover

We track tenure and voluntary employee turnover. We then use this data to develop our human capital strategy. In 2020, 56% of our workforce had been with the Company for five years or longer, and our global voluntary turnover rate was 4.3%. While these numbers provide valuable insight, the context surrounding these numbers provide an even clearer picture into our global workforce. In April and December 2017, respectively, the Siem Helix  and the Siem Helix  commenced operations in Brazil. The commencement of operations required the employment and new hire of sufficient quantities of individuals to man those vessels. In November 2019, we took delivery of the Q7000. The mobilization of the Q7000 again required the hiring and employment of additional employees. Over the past four years, we have commenced operations with three new vessels, which directly impacts the tenure percentages above and skews a greater number of employees into the zero-to-four years category.
Training, Engagement and Improvement

We recognize that we must train our staff in order to be as prepared as possible to perform our operations safely. Our staff receives up to date and relevant training required for their jobs, and Helix leadership actively engages staff so that behaviors reflect the training and critical safety approach we all desire. The initial vessel orientation for new hires is the first of many steps in shaping those behaviors. Each vessel and shore-based employee is assigned a Qualifications and Training Matrix that specifies the qualifications and training that an employee is required to have for the applicable position. All training is tracked annually and evaluated to confirm the quality of training. Ongoing and thoughtful employee participation is a vital element in the success of our QHSE process. While we believe in the strength and effectiveness of our QHSE programs, we continuously look at how we can improve our control of QHSE risks through the behavior and feedback of our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to diversity and inclusion throughout our workforce. In 2020, our worldwide workforce represented 28 different nationalities. Our hiring managers and human resources departments in all regions partner to find the best candidates without regard to factors such as race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, marital status, veteran status, genetic information or any other basis that would be in violation of any applicable federal, state, local or international law. Employing people with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives makes Helix a stronger business. We are committed to attracting and retaining high-performing employees through this diverse talent base and evaluating and promoting throughout our organization based on skills and performance.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Overview

We provide services primarily in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions, and as such we are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including international treaties, flag state requirements, environmental laws and regulations, requirements for obtaining operating and navigation licenses, local content requirements, and other national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels and other assets operate or are registered, all of which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels and other assets. Beginning in 2019 we operate end of life offshore oil and gas wells, some of which are producing and which we plan to ultimately decommission. Being an operator of wells subjects us to additional regulatory oversight from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”).
International Conventions

Our vessels are subject to applicable international maritime convention requirements, which include, but are not limited to, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001 (ratified in 2008), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS”), the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”), the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (the “MODU Code”), and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the “BWM Convention”). These regimes are applicable in most countries where we operate; however, the flag state and the country where we operate may impose additional requirements. In addition, these conventions impose liability for certain environmental discharges, including strict liability in some cases.

U.S. Overview

In the U.S., we are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard (the “Coast Guard”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) as well as state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which we operate, three divisions of the U.S. Department of the Interior (BOEM, BSEE and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue), and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”), as well as classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (the “ABS”). We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety for our land-based operations.

International Overview

We provide services globally and generally can be subject to local laws and regulations wherever we operate. Those laws and regulations generally govern environmental, labor, health and safety and other matters. The regulatory regimes of the U.K. and Brazil are of particular importance given the locations of our current operations. The U.K. Continental Shelf in the North Sea is regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority (the “OGA”) in accordance with the Petroleum Act 1998. The OGA controls all of the Petroleum Operations Notices with which we comply for various well intervention and subsea construction projects, as required. The OGA also regulates the environmental requirements for our operations in the North Sea. We comply as required by the Oil Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2005. In the North Sea, international regulations govern working hours and the working environment, as well as standards for diving procedures, equipment and diver health. We also note that the U.K.’s exit from the EU may result in the imposition of new laws, rules or regulations affecting operations inside U.K. territorial waters.

Our operations in Brazil are predominantly regulated by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, the federal government agency responsible for the regulation of the oil sector. Additional regulatory oversight is provided, among others, by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, which oversees Brazilian environmental legislation, implements the National Environmental Policy and exercises control and supervision of the use of natural resources, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, which regulates products and services subject to health regulations, and the Ministry of Labor, which regulates a variety of subjects including work-related accident prevention and use of machinery and equipment.

Operating Certification

Each of our vessels is subject to regulatory requirements of the country in which the vessel is registered, also known as the flag state. In addition, the country in which a vessel is operating may have its own requirements with respect to safety and environmental protections. These requirements must be satisfied in order for the vessel to operate. Flag state requirements are largely established by international treaties such as MARPOL, SOLAS, the ISM Code and the MODU Code, and in some instances, specific requirements of the flag state. These include engineering, safety, safe manning and other requirements related to the maritime industry. Each of our vessels must also maintain its “in-class” status with a classification society, evidencing that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable flag state rules and international conventions. Our vessels generally must undergo a class survey once every five years. In the U.S., the Coast Guard sets safety standards and is authorized to investigate marine incidents, recommend safety standards, and inspect vessels at will. We also adhere to manning requirements implemented by the Coast Guard for operations on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”).
Local Content Requirements and Cabotage Rules

We are subject to local content requirements with respect to equipment and crews utilized in certain of our operations. Governments in some countries, notably in Brazil and in the West Africa region, have become increasingly active in establishing and enforcing such requirements along with other aspects of the energy industries in their respective countries.

A number of jurisdictions where we operate require that certain work may only be performed by vessels built and/or registered in that jurisdiction. In some instances, an exemption may be available, or we may be subject to an additional tax to use a non-local vessel. In the U.S., we are subject to the Coastwise Merchandise Statute (commonly known as the “Jones Act”), which generally provides that only vessels built in the U.S., owned 75% by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizen seafarers may transport merchandise between points in the U.S. The Jones Act has been applied to offshore oil and gas work in the U.S. through interpretations by the CBP.

BOEM and BSEE

Our business is affected by laws and regulations as well as changing tax laws and policies relating to the offshore energy industry in general. The operation of oil and gas properties located on the OCS is regulated primarily by BOEM and BSEE. Among other requirements, BOEM requires lessees of OCS properties to post bonds or provide other adequate financial assurance in connection with the P&A of wells located offshore and the removal of production facilities. Following the Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010, BSEE implemented enhanced standards for companies engaged in the development of offshore oil and gas wells. As an operator of wells, we are also required to have a BSEE-approved Oil Spill Response Plan. In April 2016 BSEE issued the final Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf-Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control Rule, which updated requirements for equipment and operations for well control activities associated with drilling, completion, workover and decommissioning operations, and provided further guidance for the design and operation of remotely operated tools. In May 2019, BSEE released revised regulations for well control and blowout preventer systems designed to improve operations on the OCS. The regulations address offshore oil and gas drilling, completions, workovers, and decommissioning activities, and we have incorporated them into our operations.
Other Regulatory Impact

Additional proposals and proceedings before various international, federal and state regulatory agencies and courts could affect the energy industry, including curtailing production and demand for fossil fuels. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective, or how they will be interpreted or enforced.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Overview

Our operations are subject to a variety of national (including federal, state and local) and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce these laws that are often complex, costly to comply with, and carry substantial administrative, civil and possibly criminal penalties for compliance failure. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by the governmental agencies with authority over environmental regulation. Under these laws and regulations, we may be liable for remediation or removal costs, damages, civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other costs associated with releases of hazardous materials (including oil) into the environment, and that liability may be imposed on us even if the acts that resulted in the releases were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those acts were performed. Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed below, but this discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern or otherwise affect our operations.
MARPOL

The U.S. is one of approximately 170 member countries party to the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), an agency of the United Nations responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. The IMO has negotiated MARPOL, which imposes on the shipping industry environmental standards relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage, and air emissions.
OPA 90

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), imposes a variety of requirements on offshore facility owners or operators in the U.S., and the lessee or permittee of the U.S. area in which an offshore facility is located, as well as owners and operators of vessels. Any of these entities or persons can be “responsible parties” and are strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills. Failure to comply with OPA may result in the assessment of civil, administrative and criminal penalties. In addition, OPA requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the Coast Guard with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from those vessels. A number of foreign jurisdictions also require us to present satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility. We satisfy these requirements through appropriate insurance coverage.
Water Pollution

For operations in the U.S., the Clean Water Act imposes controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the U.S. and imposes potential liability for the costs of remediating releases of petroleum and other substances. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The EPA issues Vessel General Permits (“VGPs”) covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of each deficiency. Additionally, certain state regulations and VGPs prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the exploration for, and production of, oil and natural gas into certain coastal and offshore waters. Many states have laws analogous to the Clean Water Act and also require remediation of releases of hazardous substances in state waters. Internationally, the BWM Convention covers mandatory ballast water exchange requirements.
Air Pollution and Emissions

A variety of regulatory developments, proposals and requirements and legislative initiatives focused on restricting the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases apply to the jurisdictions in which we operate. Annex VI of MARPOL addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide, and requires the use of low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. The IMO designates the waters off North America as an Emission Control Area, meaning that vessels operating in the U.S. must use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Directives have been issued designed to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. These can impact both the fuel and the engines that may be used onboard vessels.
CERCLA

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) requires the remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment in the U.S. and imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons, including owners and operators of contaminated sites where the release occurred and those companies that transport, dispose of or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous substances released at the sites.
OCSLA

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (“OCSLA”), provides the U.S. government with broad authority to impose environmental protection requirements applicable to lessees and permittees operating in the OCS. Specific design and operational standards may apply to OCS vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions that could curtail operations and cancel leases.
Current Compliance and Potential Material Impact

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We maintain a robust operational compliance program, and we maintain and update our programs to meet or exceed applicable regulatory requirements. We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, changes in environmental laws and regulations, changes in the ways such laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and thus there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs or liabilities in the future. Costs or liabilities related to environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and could have a significant impact on our financial ability to carry out our operations.
INSURANCE MATTERS

Our businesses involve a high degree of operational risk. Hazards such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions and operational hazards such as rigging failures, human error, or accidents are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause marine and subsea operational equipment failures resulting in personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and the suspension of operations. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As discussed below, we maintain insurance policies to cover some of our risk of loss associated with our operations. We maintain the amount of insurance we believe is prudent based on our estimated loss potential. However, not all of our business activities can be insured at the levels we desire because of either limited market availability or unfavorable economics.

Our current insurance program generally covers a 12-month period beginning July 1 each year.

We maintain Hull and Increased Value insurance, which provides coverage for physical damage up to an agreed amount for each vessel. The deductibles are $1 million on the Q4000, the Q5000, the Q7000, the HP I and the Well Enhancer, and $500,000 on the Seawell. In addition to the primary deductibles, the vessels are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of $5 million. We also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, which covers liabilities arising from the operation of vessels, and General Liability insurance, which covers liabilities arising from construction operations. Our current deductible on the P&I Liability is $100,000 per occurrence and $250,000 per occurrence on the General Liability. Onshore employees are covered by Workers’ Compensation. Offshore employees and marine crews are covered by a Maritime Employers Liability (“MEL”) insurance policy, which covers Jones Act exposures and currently includes a deductible of $250,000 per occurrence. In addition to the liability policies described above, we currently carry various layers of Umbrella Liability for total limits of $500 million in excess of primary limits as well as OPA insurance for our offshore oil and gas properties with $35 million of coverage as required by BOEM. Our self-insured retention on our medical and health benefits program for employees is $300,000 per participant.

We also maintain Operator Extra Expense coverage that provides up to $150 million of coverage per each loss occurrence for a well control issue on oil and gas properties where we are the operator. Separately, we also maintain $500 million of liability insurance. For any given oil spill event we maintain up to $650 million of insurance coverage.

We customarily have agreements with our customers and vendors in which each contracting party is responsible for its respective personnel. Under these agreements we are indemnified against third-party claims related to the injury or death of our customers’ or vendors’ personnel, and vice versa. With respect to well work contracted to us, the customer is typically contractually responsible for pollution emanating from the well. We separately maintain additional coverage for an amount up to $100 million that would cover us under certain circumstances against any such third-party claims associated with well control events.

We receive workers’ compensation, MEL and other insurance claims in the normal course of business. We analyze each claim for its validity, potential exposure and estimated ultimate liability. Our services are provided in hazardous environments where events involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur, and claims arising from such an event may result in our being named as a responsible party. Although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events, or that such insurance will continue to be available at current levels of cost or coverage, we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations.

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

Defined below are certain terms helpful to understanding our business that are located throughout this Annual Report:

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM):  BOEM is responsible for managing environmentally and economically responsible development of U.S. offshore resources. Its functions include offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies.

Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE):  BSEE is responsible for safety and environmental oversight of U.S. offshore oil and gas operations, including permitting and inspections of offshore oil and gas operations. Its functions include the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting offshore exploration, development and production, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs.

Deepwater:  Water depths exceeding 1,000 feet.

Dynamic Positioning (DP):  Computer directed thruster systems that use satellite-based positioning and other positioning technologies to provide the proper counteraction to wind, current and wave forces enabling a vessel to maintain its position without the use of anchors.

DP2:  Two DP systems on a single vessel providing the redundancy that allows the vessel to maintain position even in the absence of one DP system.

DP3:  DP control system comprising a triple-redundant controller unit and three identical operator stations. The system is designed to withstand fire or flood in any one compartment. Loss of position should not occur from any single failure.

Intervention Riser System (IRS):  A subsea system that establishes a direct connection from a well intervention vessel, through a rigid riser, to a conventional or horizontal subsea tree in depths up to 10,000 feet. An IRS can be utilized for wireline intervention, production logging, coiled-tubing operations, well stimulation, and full plug and abandonment operations, and provides well control in order to safely access the well bore for these activities.

Plug and Abandonment (P&A):  P&A operations usually consist of placing several cement plugs in the wellbore to isolate the reservoir and other fluid-bearing formations when a well reaches the end of its lifetime.

QHSE:  Quality, Health, Safety and Environmental programs designed to protect the environment, safeguard employee health and avoid injuries.

Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (ROAM):  A subsea system designed to act as a barrier to the environment during upper abandonment operations and during production tubing removal in open water, when run as a complement to an IRS. ROAM provides the ability to capture contaminants or gas within the system and circulate them back to the safe handling systems on board the vessel, such that no well contaminants are released into the environment.

Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV):  A robotic vehicle used to complement, support and increase the efficiency of diving and subsea operations and for tasks beyond the capability of manned diving operations.

ROVDrill:  A coring system deployed with an ROV system capable of taking cores from the seafloor in water depths up to 10,000 feet. Because the ROV system operates from the seafloor there is no need for surface drilling strings or the larger support spreads required for conventional coring.

Saturation diving:  Divers working from special chambers for extended periods at a pressure equivalent to the pressure at the work site, required for work in water depths between 200 and 1,000 feet.

Spot vessels:  Vessels not owned or under long-term charter but contracted on a short-term basis to perform specific projects.

Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL):  A riserless subsea system designed to provide access to the well bore while providing well control safety for activities that do not require a riser conduit. A SIL can be utilized for wireline, logging, light perforating, zone isolation, plug setting and removal, and decommissioning, and it facilitates access to subsea wells from a monohull vessel to provide safe, efficient and cost effective riserless well intervention and abandonment solutions.

Trencher or trencher system:  A subsea robotics system capable of providing post-lay trenching, inspection and burial and maintenance of submarine cables and flowlines in water depths of 30 to 7,200 feet across a range of seabed and environmental conditions.

Well intervention services:  Activities related to well maintenance and production management and enhancement services. Our well intervention operations include the utilization of slickline and electric line services, pumping services, specialized tooling and coiled tubing services.
