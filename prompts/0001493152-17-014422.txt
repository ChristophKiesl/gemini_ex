Directly and indirectly through our contractual relationships, we provide our specialized services to over 300,000 patients annually. No employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries practices primary care medicine and the Company’s services do not require a medical or nursing license.
 
Our strict adherence to public regulatory standards, as well as self-imposed standards of excellence, have allowed us to navigate with ease through the industry’s licensing and regulatory framework.

Business Strategy
 
Our mission is to build a Canada and U.S. based multi-disciplinary primary healthcare service provider that provides certain high-quality specialized healthcare services and products through the integration of technology and medical science. Key elements of our business strategy include:

● | Increase Market Share in Canada. We intend to expand our market share in Canada through strategic acquisitions and micro-clinic roll-outs. In addition, we expect to continue increasing our market share in existing eldercare services, occupational therapy services, physiotherapy services and speech language pathology services through network affiliation growth and new contract awards. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding Operations into the United States. We plan to expand into the United States through: 


● | The introduction of a customized version of our multi-disciplinary primary healthcare service model, with emphasis on pain prevention, treatment and management, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The strategic acquisition of targeted U.S. operating clinics in key geographical areas, and 
● | Establishment of strategic corporate alliances with existing healthcare entities allowing us immediate access to their client base. We expect to integrate certain of our specialized multi-disciplinary services and products that are a direct compliment to the existing healthcare related products and services already provided by brand-recognized, established retail entities such as grocers, pharmacies and clinics.

● | Leveraging our Expertise in the Interface of Technology and Patient Engagement to Introduce our Multi-disciplinary Primary Healthcare Services and Products through “Micro-clinics” Located in Underserved Population Centers. Our expertise allows us to bring our specialized multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services and products to people in urban, rural and remote population centers, rather than relying on the older model of bringing the people to healthcare. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding our Posture, Stride, and Kinetic Body Movement Scanning Technologies and Protocols. When combined with decades of data harvesting and analysis, we believe that these technologies and protocols provide our clinics with the ability to deliver better care, early diagnosis and preventative healthcare strategies. 
● | Continuing to Develop and Expand our Virtual Physician Access System. We expect to continue development and expansion of our virtual physician access system, sometimes referred to in the industry as “telemedicine” or “virtual medicine.” Our telemedicine system provides patients with real-time access to third-party primary care doctors and specialists in most medical disciplines. Telemedicine is transforming all approaches to healthcare by providing ease of access and reduced costs for patients, particularly in areas with limited access to primary care general practitioners and specialists. Unlike other telemedicine platforms in today’s marketplace, our unique advanced telemedicine platform integrates certain medical devices, such as a blood pressure reading device, a derma scope and an ophthalmoscope otoscope, each of which can provide the doctor with real-time diagnostic data, greatly enhancing the doctor’s ability to provide the patient with an accurate diagnosis. Our telemedicine platform is designed with a relatively low-cost structure, which can allow any medical clinic or location affordably to install and utilize our telemedicine platform. 
● | Launching our Exclusive Cannabidiol (“CBD”) Medical Cannabis Product Platform to Include Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution. Our CBD products will be specifically focused on CBD for usage as (i) a treatment aid; (ii) relief for a large array of neurological disorders; and (iii) an alternative option for healthcare providers in place of prescribing opioids to patients. We have established relationships worldwide with low-cost grow and production entities which, when combined with having ownership and control of the end-product manufacturing process, allows us to provide high-quality, low-cost CBD medical cannabis products. Offering our patients access to non-hallucinogenic and non-addictive natural remedies, under required clinical oversight policies and procedures as they relate to medicinal cannabis and CBD, combined with our existing clinic-based treatment protocols allows us to enter this market segment with a unique integration model not readily available in the marketplace. 
● | Launching our Motor Vehicle Accident (“MVA”) Service in Canada. Our MVA service is expected to provide certain occupational therapy, assessment, analysis, rehabilitation, mobility aids and counseling. 
● | Launching our Independent Medical Evaluation (“IME”) Service in Canada. Our IME service will be available for corporate and insurance clients. 

Back on Track Physiotherapy and Health Centres
 
On September 30, 2013, NHL closed a Purchase and Sale of Assets Agreement with Michael Gaynor Physiotherapy Professional Corporation, operating as Back on Track Physiotherapy and Health Centres (“Back on Track”), for all tangible and intangible assets of Back on Track, including four operational physiotherapy clinics located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Since 1994, Back on Track Physiotherapy and Health Centres have been providing in-clinic physiotherapy and multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services including chiropractic services, kinesiology, massage therapy, chiropody/foot care and occupational therapy services. As of November 28, 2017, we operate eight Back on Track Physiotherapy and Health centres in the Ottawa area and eastern Ontario regions.

Novo Peak Health Inc.
 
On September 16, 2013, Novo Peak Health Inc. (“Novo Peak Health”) was incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of NHL for the purpose of providing multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services to long-term care and retirement facilities in Ontario, Canada. On September 30, 2013, NHL acquired the assets of Peak Health LTC Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation formed in 2006, including existing contracts with 20 long-care homes and a community physiotherapy clinic license with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. This acquisition provided the initial foundation for Novo Peak Health’s operational and growth strategy focused on providing rehabilitation, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and assistive devices program (“ADP”) multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services to eldercare patients located at various long-term care homes, retirement homes and community clients across Ontario. Novo Peak Health provides its eldercare patients an integrated approach to rehabilitative strategies and continued education for the residents, their caregivers and the patients’ family members through its two major divisions: physiotherapy (“PT”) and occupational therapy (“OT”).
 
Novo Peak Health’s proprietary Electronic Rehabilitation Record and Management Reporting (“ERRMR”) software solution provides Novo Peak Health the ability to provide each eldercare facility, of both the PT and OT divisions, with reports that identify cost and optimization possibilities, a wide variety of patient outcome measurements, overall contract effectiveness and much more.
 
Both PT and OT have similar philosophies, offering an overlap and synchronicity between the divisions. This allows for opportunities where contracts for multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services with one particular division can create contractual opportunities for the other division. The PT division has been in existence since the beginning of Novo Peak Health, and the OT division was formed in April 2017 due to an increase in demand for OT healthcare services at many eldercare facilities.
 
The Novo Peak Health PT division consists of the following five sectors:
 

1. | Long-Term Care Homes (“LTC”) sector - contracts with client homes to provide individualized PT and group exercise classes to the residents living in the homes. Registered physiotherapists are assisted by on-site support personnel to deliver individualized care based on assessed needs. These services are primarily funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (“MOHLTC”). The Novo Peak Health team assists in providing Assistive Device Assessments enabling residents access to varying mobility aides. In addition to providing PT services, our team assists the interdisciplinary team in annual care conferences for residents in the home, education regarding nursing restorative programming, back education, falls prevention and many other subjects related to PT or physical health and wellness. The Novo Peak Health team works together with the interdisciplinary team to help with mandatory coding of the RAI-MDS resident assessment which assists the home in accessing payment from the MOHLTC. Additionally, through Novo Peak Health’s proprietary software, the homes have access to unparalleled reporting solutions to help provide objective and quantitative measures for their Continuous Quality Improvement (“CQI”) program. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Retirement Homes (“RH”) sector - contracts with client homes to provide individualized PT and group exercise classes to the facilities’ residents. Registered physiotherapists are assisted by the onsite support personnel to deliver individualized care based on assessed needs. These services are partly privately funded and partly funded by the MOHLTC. Similar to the LTC sector, the Novo Peak Health team assists with education of the nursing/interdisciplinary team as well as being able to provide in depth service reports to the homes to measure desired service delivery. In addition to the services above, some of the residents in the retirement homes (or their family members) desire to have an increased level of service and opt to pay for additional private services. This is available on a fee-for-service basis and is most often in the form of individualized PT. 
3. | Community Care Access Centres (“CCACs”) and Home Care sector - now managed by the Local Health Integration Networks (“LHINs”). Contracts with two main “cluster providers” (companies who have direct service contracts with the CCAC/LHIN) funded by the MOHLTC, to provide multi-disciplinary services to patients living in the community, patients living at-home or in a retirement home. Novo Peak Health is sub-contracted by the “cluster provider companies” to provide in-home physiotherapy services and group exercise classes to these clients who cannot access outpatient services due to mobility challenges. Primarily, these patients are elderly while some patients are not elderly but are post-operation” with mobility challenges. This contract is unique to Northeastern Ontario LHIN, which takes care of more than 565,000 people across 400,000 square kilometres and five sub-regions.

4. | Exercise & Falls Prevention (“EFP”) sector - contracts with two companies who are directly contracted by the MOHLTC to provide exercise and falls prevention classes in the community at large. The delivery of these classes covers three LHINs (Central, Toronto Central and Central East) with an estimated population of 4.4 million people. A new community group exercise class initiative, released in 2013 and funded by the MOHLTC, is delivered by exercise instructors over a 48-week period each year. The goal of these classes is to assist seniors in maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle while still living at home. In addition, another component of the September 2013 MOHLTC initiative is the delivery of fall prevention classes taught by specialized registered providers, such as kinesiologists and physiotherapists, with the assistance of exercise instructors. The goal of these classes is to assess seniors’ general health status, identify defined levels of risk pertaining to balance and falling, and educate seniors about fall prevention through a combination of increased knowledge and teaching exercises designed to improve strength and balance.

5. | Outpatient Sector (“OP”) sector – two community based clinics for which Novo Peak Health provides outpatient PT services. One of the clinics has been in operation for years and the other is a new start-up, in North Western Ontario, being affiliated with a local hospital/health network. One of the clinics also provides chiropractic services. Both clinics have a component of their services that are funded by the MOHLTC while the remainder of the services in the community based clinics are funded by motor vehicle accident treatment plans, extended health benefits insurance coverage, or private payment. These services are specifically targeted to be delivered to clients who meet the following criteria: 


● | Aged 65 years of age and older or aged 18 years of age and younger, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Are post-operative, or 
● | Have just been discharged from a hospital, or 
● | Are receiving services from Ontario Disability Services Program (“ODSP”) or Ontario Works. 

 
The Novo Peak Health OT Division consists of two sectors:
 

1. | Long Term Care Sector - contracts with client homes to provide the following occupational therapy services: 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessments and interventions to support maintenance & restoration of function related to seating, mobility, positioning for self-care, prevention of pressure ulcers, falls and use of restraints, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Speech language and pathology services, including evaluation and treatment, 
● | Swallowing and eating assessments and interventions, and 
● | Cognitive behavioral assessments and care planning. 

 
Our occupational therapists have specialized training in mobility providing assistive device assessments when required. This service is funded primarily by the MOHLTC.
 

2. | Retirement Home & Community (“RH&C”) - individual contracts with private payers providing the following services: 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home safety assessments, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Functional assessments,

Novo Dental
 
On March 31, 2015, NHL completed the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with the Sophie Freeman Dental Hygiene Professional Corporation operated under the name Novo Dental. This joint venture was formed for the purpose of providing dental assessments and treatments, as well as preventative dental care and education, for elderly located in long-term care homes and retirement facilities. As required, Novo Dental processes referrals to dentists, oral maxillofacial surgeons and denturists.
 
Combining the experience and contacts developed by NHL over many years of providing multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services to the aging population along with the over 24-years Sophie Freeman had as a registered dental hygienist, our joint venture is well positioned to best understand the advanced dental services, assessments and education needs of the elderly, including those individuals that are either physically or medically compromised.
 
Novo Dental provides the following preventive dental hygiene care and assessment services:
 

● | Dental/oral assessments - complimentary dental and oral assessments to all residents in Long Term Care. This assessment consists of a thorough intra and extra oral assessment of lymph nodes, lips, tongue, salivary glands, hard and soft palate, teeth and dentures. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Scaling of teeth - Includes removing tartar buildup with appropriate instruments to help maintain health of gums and bone. 
● | Polishing of teeth - includes removing dental plaque and stains to maintain healthy gums. 
● | Fluoride varnishes - provide all necessary cavity-preventative fluoride varnishes such as Duraflor and an assortment of higher concentrated fluoridated toothpaste. Fluoride varnishes are used to help prevent cavities, desensitize teeth and to alleviate thermal sensitivity. 
● | Temporary restorations - provide temporary restorations to alleviate pain and delay the progression of decay. Temporary restorations help maintain resident appearance and ability to masticate. 
● | Professional denture cleanings - includes soaking dentures in a solution and placing them in an ultrasonic bath to remove tartar, plaque and stains without damaging the dentures. Novo Dental also provides professional labeling of dentures. 
● | Oral health education - Novo Dental provides hands-on education to staff on how to effectively and safely provide daily oral hygiene care. 

Novo Healthnet Rehab Limited
 
Novo Healthnet Rehab Limited, a 100% owned Canadian subsidiary of NHL, holds all rental and lease agreements for the Novo affiliates and produces no revenue.
 
About Our Affiliate Clinics
 
In order to strengthen our position within the Canadian Preferred Provider Network (“PPN”), we have built a contracted affiliate relationship with over 150 clinics across Canada. The PPN is a network comprised of three major insurance companies and their subsidiaries, totaling 16 insurance companies. PPN member insurance companies in need of specific primary healthcare solutions for their patients send referrals to specific clinics registered through the PPN. We, as one of five major providers to the PPN, receive referrals through the PPN. This subset of business is a continuous source of referrals, from the insurance company payer to the approved group of clinics meeting the insurance companies’ pre-determined set of criteria for what they believe to be an appropriate clinical setting. Affiliate clinics pay us a mix of a flat fee and a percentage based fee upon receipt of a payment for a service referred through the PPN.
 
The services provided by our affiliate clinics are consistent with the multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services provided by clinics owned by us. While each affiliate clinic may provide additional unique healthcare solutions, in order to strengthen its position in its respective immediate local market, all affiliate clinics must meet certain criteria established by the PPN, so these criteria are consistent among all of our owned and affiliated clinics. Most of our affiliate clinics are located in Ontario. Approximately, 15% of our affiliate clinics are located outside of Ontario, including in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Alberta.

Contracts
 
Certain contracts held with client homes and client companies follow standard formats, templates and include generally accepted terms of reference. Certain of the main clauses of the NHL contracts for services and other work product contain language intended to (1) clarify which entity is the health information custodian of the medical files (usually held by the client home or company), (2) define release of liability, (3) ensure privacy and confidentiality of proprietary information or private health information, (4) define provisions of worker’s compensation clearance or benefits for employees and/or contractors, (5) detail provisions of value-added items, services or programs, (6) terms and conditions of the contract (often for a set number of years with an option to a renewal option), (7) provide for termination conditions, and (8) invoicing and billing procedures.
Competition
 
In Canada, the specialized multi-disciplinary primary healthcare service sector in which we operate is highly competitive. With a finite number of patients and clients, companies providing multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services similar to those that we provide are vying for the same contracts, customers and referrals.
 
Our business strategy includes pursuing selective acquisitions of additional multi-disciplinary primary healthcare providers and clinics in markets that we currently populate as well as new geographic markets. In pursuit of certain acquisitions, we face competition from other for-profit multi-disciplinary primary healthcare providers and clinics that are neither affiliated with nor owned by NHL. We face competition from existing multi-disciplinary primary healthcare providers that offer patients a different path of diagnosis, assessment, treatment, management and rehabilitation healthcare services. We utilize both employee and independent contractor clinicians for delivery of our multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services and are always seeking to attract clinics and clinicians that are qualified to maintain our Company’s reputation for high-quality care and patient satisfaction.
 
Our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider. Patients in the markets where we provide our multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services may travel to out-of-market providers to seek medical treatment for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the need for services we do not offer or as a result of either a PPN referral or the referral of another clinician. Patients who seek multi-disciplinary primary healthcare services from an out-of-market provider may subsequently shift their preferences to that clinician for future healthcare services.
 
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2017, we employed 61 full-time employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and have not experienced any labor disputes.
