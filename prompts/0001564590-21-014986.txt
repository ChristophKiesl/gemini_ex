Item 1. Business. 
Our Business
 We are a market-leading business services provider of safety, specialty and industrial services in over 200 locations, primarily in North America and with an expanding platform in Europe. We provide statutorily mandated and other contracted services to a strong 
 3

base of long-standing customers across industries. We have a winning leadership culture driven by entrepreneurial business leaders to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.
 We believe that our core strategies of driving organic growth and growth through accretive acquisitions, promoting sharing of best practices across all of our businesses and leveraging our scale and services offerings, place us in the position to capitalize on opportunities and trends in the industries we serve, grow our businesses and advance our position in each of our markets. We believe that our diverse customer base, regional approach to operating our businesses, specialty operations in niche markets, strong commitment to leadership development, long-standing customers with a robust reputation in the industries we serve, and strong safety track record differentiates us from our competitors.
 We have a disciplined acquisition platform which has historically provided strategic acquisitions that are integrated into our operations. Since 2005, we have completed more than 70 acquisitions. We target companies that align with our strategic priorities and demonstrate key value drivers such as culture, geography, end markets and client base, capabilities and leadership. Our priorities are unified around maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing operational efficiencies, cost synergies, and integration of organizational processes to drive margin expansion. Each of our businesses maintains its identity, reputation, customer relationships and culture following acquisition, and we invest heavily into cultivating leadership at each business. Our acquired businesses benefit from the resources of direct access to the APG network, which facilitates organizational sharing of knowledge and best practices, increases collaboration across our businesses and develops cross-brand solutions which foster enhanced experience, quality and efficiency.
 We employ a regional operating model designed to improve speed and responsiveness to our customers across our businesses, empower leadership of our businesses to drive business performance and execute key decisions, and foster cross-functional sharing of best practices. This structure promotes a business-owner mindset among our individual business leaders and combines the personal attention of a small-to-medium sized company with the strength and support of an industry leader. It also allows each of our businesses to remain highly focused on best positioning itself within the categories in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial performance.
 We operate our business under three primary operating segments, which are also our reportable segments:
  
• | Safety Services – A leading provider of safety services in North America and Europe, focusing on end-to-end integrated occupancy systems (fire protection solutions, HVAC and entry systems), including design, installation, inspection and service of these integrated systems. The work performed within this segment spans across industries and facilities and includes commercial, data center, distribution, education, healthcare, high tech, industrial and special-hazard settings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialty Services – A leading provider of a variety of infrastructure services and specialized industrial plant services, which include maintenance and repair of critical infrastructure such as electric, gas, water, sewer and telecommunications infrastructure. Our services include engineering and design, fabrication, installation, maintenance service and repair, and retrofitting and upgrading. Customers within this segment vary from private and public utilities, communications, healthcare, education, manufacturing, industrial plants and governmental agencies throughout the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial Services – A leading provider of a variety of services to the energy industry focused on transmission and distribution. This segment’s services include oil and gas pipeline infrastructure, access and road construction, supporting facilities, and performing ongoing integrity management and maintenance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Industry 
 The industries in which we operate are highly fragmented and comprised of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers across various end markets and geographies. We believe the following industry trends are affecting, and will continue to affect, demand for our services. 
 Increased Regulation. The life safety industry is highly regulated at the federal, state and local levels and continuous regulatory changes, including mandated building codes and inspections and maintenance requirements, continue to generate increasing demand for our services, often on a recurring basis. Specifically, the Uniform Building Codes written by the National Fire Protection Association, and the International Code Council regulate fire suppression and sprinkler systems. Among other things, these codes require testing, inspections, repair, maintenance and specific retrofits of building fire suppression and sprinkler systems which 
 4

generates recurring revenue related to those services. As these associations and government agencies continue to adopt new, more stringent regulations, the demand for our services increases. 
 Additionally, in the United States, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provides federal tax incentives to businesses that install fire suppression and sprinkler systems in new buildings, upgrade existing systems or retrofit existing structures with systems. 
 Deferred Infrastructure Investment. Following several years of deferred investment, the aging U.S. infrastructure system requires significant maintenance, repair and retrofit services which has spurred demand in our industry. State and local municipalities have deferred infrastructure spending for many years which has resulted in the need to rebuild or retrofit a large portion of the U.S. infrastructure. One industry publication anticipates that up to an estimated $4 trillion will need to be invested in U.S. infrastructure by 2025.
 COVID and Non-Residential Construction. The negative economic impacts of COVID-19 have had an overall negative impact on non-residential construction. However, certain end markets we serve have been less impacted, such as data centers and distribution. As a leading provider of specialty contracting services, we are impacted by these macroeconomic events and are unable to know if the recovery from COVID economic impacts in all markets we serve will rebound timely and completely. We believe that certain services driven by regulatory requirements assists our ability to have demand for our services even in tough markets; however, these markets may experience additional congestion.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that the following are our key competitive strengths: 
 Leading Market Positions in Diverse Set of Niche Industries. We believe that we are one of the leaders in each of the niche industries we serve, including the industry leader in fire protection and sprinkler system solutions and among the top five specialty contractors in North America. We believe that our diverse and strong customer base in each of our end markets, regional approach to operating our businesses, operations in niche industries with strong cross-selling opportunities and recurring revenue potential, strong commitment to leadership development, long-standing customer relationships with a robust reputation in the industries we serve, and strong safety track record differentiates us from our competitors. As a result, we believe we have better access to new business opportunities, allowing us to maintain and advance our market share positions. 
 Repeat Revenue with Diverse, Strong Customer Base. We focus on repeat business with long-term, well-diversified customers across a variety of end markets, which we believe provides us with a stable cash flow profile and substantial runway for organic growth. Maintenance and service revenues are less cyclical, and are reasonably recurring due to consistent renewal rates and deep customer relationships. We have long-standing relationships with our diverse roster of repeat blue chip customers who are spread across a variety of end markets.
 Attractive Industry Fundamentals. We believe that the industries in which we operate are subject to increasingly complex and evolving regulatory environments and have experienced pent-up demand resulting from years of deferred maintenance and retrofit investment. In addition, we believe that there is increasing demand for specialty contracting services and for inspection and maintenance services relating to aging energy infrastructure as customers try to prolong the useful lives of their pipelines and limit incidents. We believe this presents great opportunities for us to drive growth in our businesses and enhance our market share positions. We also believe that the diversity of the niche markets we serve and the regulatory-driven demand for certain of our services will enable us to better withstand various economic cycles. 
 Disciplined Acquisition Platform with History of Strategic Acquisitions. We have a disciplined acquisition platform through which we systematically target, execute and integrate strategic acquisitions. Since 2005, we have completed over 70 acquisitions. Through our selective approach, we identify and assess companies that align with our strategic priorities and demonstrate key value drivers such as culture, geography, end markets and client base, capabilities and leadership, opportunity to expand our service offering or geographic footprint, or provide a competitive opportunity such as new end markets or client base. Each of our businesses 
 5

maintains its identity, reputation, customer relationships and culture following acquisition while benefiting from the resources of the APG network, which we believe is an important differentiator.
Differentiated Leadership Culture and Operating Model. We believe that one of our core pillars of success is our distinct leadership development culture predicated on Building Great LeadersTM, our cross-functional leadership development platform designed to enable independent company leadership, cultivate broad management skills, enhance organizational flexibility, and empower the next cohort of leaders across our businesses. This culture of investing in leadership development at all levels of the organization has created an empowered, entrepreneurial atmosphere which facilitates organizational sharing of knowledge and best practices and enables the development of cross-brand solutions and innovation. Moreover, we employ a decentralized operating model which improves speed and responsiveness to customers in industries with strict requirements. This also empowers the leaders of our businesses to drive business performance and execute key decisions, while highlighting the significant focus we place on ensuring members of our team receive continuous investment in their development. 
 Attractive Financial Performance and Strong Margin and Cash Flow Profile. We believe that, due to our differentiated operating model, diversified services offerings, historically strong organic growth and disciplined acquisition strategy, we have an attractive financial performance profile. In addition, we support margin growth by leveraging our scale to benefit from procurement savings resulting from enhanced purchasing power, serving higher-margin, niche industries, and requiring minimal ongoing maintenance capital expenditures (typically less than 2% of total net revenues). We also have significant recurring revenue, which supports our ability to generate strong operating cash flows.
Our Business Strategy 
 We intend to continue to grow our businesses, both organically and through acquisitions and advance our position in each of the markets we serve by pursuing the following integrated business strategies: 
 Drive Organic Growth. We believe that we can continue to grow our businesses organically and capture additional market share across each of our segments by focusing on growing maintenance, inspection, installation, and service revenues and maximizing cross-selling opportunities. 

• | Grow Maintenance, Inspection, and Service Revenue. We believe that we can drive substantial organic growth by focusing on growing our maintenance, inspection, and service revenue, which is a component of our business in each of our segments. We plan to capitalize on our broad base of installed projects, cross-selling opportunities, and customer relationships to continue to grow maintenance, inspection, and service revenue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize Cross-Selling Opportunities. With diverse businesses, a broad reach across a variety of different industries, geographies, and end markets and a culture of collaboration, we believe that we have significant cross-selling opportunities to service more of the project life cycle and, once a project is completed, to continue to grow attractive recurring revenue streams.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Accelerate Growth through Acquisitions. We have a well-established acquisition platform with a track record of executing accretive acquisitions through our selective approach to targeting and assessing potential acquisitions that align with our values and strategic priorities. We believe that the markets in which we operate are fragmented and lend themselves to continued opportunistic acquisitions. We have grown, and plan to continue to drive growth through, accretive acquisitions, targeting businesses in our existing segments and those complementary to our service offerings.
 Continue to Foster Leadership Development throughout All Levels of the Organization. We plan to continue to invest in and support our leadership development culture through our Building Great LeadersTM platform, which we believe will continue to empower the leaders across our businesses, drive business performance and create future cross-selling opportunities. Our programmatic training and development curriculum focuses on a range of topics from enhancing technical capabilities to developing soft skills, and decision-making training to enable independent company leadership. We believe that this culture will continue to 
 6

support our decentralized operating model, which combines the personal attention of a small-to-medium sized company with the strength and support of an industry leader. 
 Leverage Our Scale and Services Portfolio. We believe that we can grow our businesses and increase our market position by leveraging our scale and broad portfolio of services offerings to capitalize on demand for single-source national providers. For example, we plan to focus on expanding national accounts and further developing an entity-wide purchasing program to realize the benefits from volume discounts and vendor pricing. In addition, we plan to leverage our industry-leading positions and the leadership across our businesses to capture growth opportunities across each of our segments.
 Customers
We have long-standing relationships with many customers in each of the industries we serve. We serve customers in both the public and private sectors, including commercial, industrial, data center, distribution, manufacturing, education, healthcare, communications, utilities, energy, high tech and governmental markets. Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies with diverse, worldwide operations to single-location companies. We have low customer concentration with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of our total net revenues for 2020. 
 Our focus on providing high quality service promotes deep, long-term relationships with our customers which often results in continued opportunities for new business and a reliable source of recurring revenue for ongoing inspection, maintenance and monitoring services. We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which can be multi-year agreements, subject to earlier termination. The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require shorter-term specialty contracting services. 
 Customers are billed with varying frequency, the timing of which is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Under the typical payment terms of master and other service agreements and contracts for specific projects, the customer makes progress payments based on quantifiable measures of performance as defined in the agreements. Some of our contracts include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount can be retained by the customer until final contract settlement.
 Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
A significant portion of our business activities is subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations are administered by various foreign, federal, state and local health and safety and environmental agencies and authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) of the U.S. Department of Labor and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may involve civil and criminal liability. From time to time, we are also subject to a wide range of reporting requirements, certification and compliance requirements as prescribed by various federal and state governmental agencies. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the normal course of our business and are neither material nor place us at any competitive disadvantage. We do not currently expect that compliance with such laws and regulations will require us to make material expenditures. We believe we have all required licenses to conduct our business activities and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses.
 We are subject to various federal and state labor and employment laws and regulations, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, Equal Opportunity Employment Act and wage and hour laws, which govern minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, mandatory benefits, health insurance and other employment-related matters. Additionally, a large portion of our business uses labor that is provided under collective bargaining agreements. As such, we are subject to federal laws and regulations related to unionized labor and collective bargaining, including the National Labor Relations Act. 
 We also are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our 
 7

contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters.
 Effect of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business
 Our revenue and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, and include impacts of customer spending patterns, contract award seasons, project schedules, holidays and timing, in particular, for large, non-recurring projects. Typically, our revenue is lowest at the beginning of the year and during the winter months during the first quarter because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause project delays. Revenue is generally higher during the summer and fall months during the third and fourth quarters, due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of the regions in which we operate. Continued cold and wet weather can often affect second quarter productivity. In the fourth quarter, many projects tend to be completed by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year, which generally has a positive effect on our revenue. However, the holiday season and inclement weather can cause delays, which can reduce revenue and increase costs on affected projects. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and could continue to result in greater seasonal and cyclical volatility than would otherwise exist under normal conditions.
 Additionally, the industries we serve can be cyclical. Fluctuations in end-user demand within those industries, or in the supply of services within those industries, can affect demand for our services. As a result, our business may be adversely affected by industry declines or by delays in new projects. Variations or unanticipated changes in project schedules in connection with large projects can create fluctuations in revenue.
 Competitive Environment
 We operate in industries which are highly competitive and highly fragmented. There are relatively few barriers to entry in many of the industries in which we operate, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise could become a competitor. In each of our segments, we compete with a number of companies, ranging from small, owner-operated businesses operating in narrow geographic regions to large companies with national scale who have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. 
 We compete based on a variety of factors, including price, service, technical expertise and experience, quality, safety record, response time and reputation for customer service. A portion of our revenue is derived from agreements with customers that contain fixed price or per unit terms, and price is often an important factor in the contract award process for such work. However, we believe our customers also consider a variety of other factors, including those described above, when selecting a service provider, and we believe that our technical capabilities, broad geographic reach and skilled labor force enable us to compete against our larger competitors. 
 Supply
We have multiple domestic and foreign supply sources at competitive pricing for substantially all of our raw material and installed components. The raw materials and various purchased components we use such as piping, steel, sheet metal, fire suppression/detection components and HVAC equipment have generally been available in sufficient quantities in a timely manner. We do and can rely on multiple third-party manufacturers as a source for pre-fabricated goods or system components. Historically we have been able to mitigate commodity cost exposure by purchasing or price locking commodities early for particular projects, as well as selectively using time or market-based escalation provisions in proposals and contracts. While we have experienced some COVID related impacts on our supply chain to date, they have not been significant. We do not anticipate experiencing significant procurement challenges, as the purchases of required materials can be sourced from multiple sources; however, tariffs or other changes in international trade relations or other factors such as the impact of pandemics or the resurgence of COVID or its variants and other future pandemics, could result in limited availability of or increased costs for some materials.Sales and Marketing
All employees, from leadership to project managers, are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key customers in each of the industries we serve. We intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by providing reliable, high-quality service in a professional manner. We believe we can continue to leverage specific technical and marketing strengths at the individual business-level to expand the services offered in each business’s market. Our culture of collaboration across our businesses provides significant cross-selling opportunities to leverage our current project base, existing relationships and professional expertise to provide additional services to our existing customers. Through our Safety Services Segment, we provide a single point of contact for customers with a regional or national portfolio of properties through our National Service Group (“NSG”) team which enhances our understanding of customers on a 
 8

national scale and allows us to build more meaningful relationships with our customers. Through our NSG team, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs.
Insurance and Legal Proceedings
The primary insured risks in our operations are bodily injury, property damage and workers’ compensation injuries. We are insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health insurance and retain the risk for claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per-incident or occurrence. Because we have very large deductibles, the vast majority of our claims are paid by us, so as a practical matter we self-insure the great majority of these risks. Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages using the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations, and management believes such accruals are adequate. 
Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 13,000 employees, of which approximately 5,700 were represented by unions and were subject to various collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are in good standing.

Talent Development and Employee Engagement
 Our continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, motivate, retain and reward high-quality, skilled employees. We are a military veteran recruiter in the U.S. and benefit from the leadership and loyalty that military veterans bring to our company. We believe our success in attracting and retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our training, leadership development and opportunities for advancement and we invest in several structured programs designed to attract and develop our human capital. For examples, our unique Leadership Development Program, predicated on Building Great LeadersTM, was created for employees in leadership positions to develop their leadership skills from mentors inside the Company while also broadening their understanding of the services offered across our businesses. This rotational program exposes participants to several of the company’s businesses across all three segments over the span of one year. On each rotation, the participant is assigned a mentor who provides real-time feedback and counseling and is offered first-hand exposure to various leadership roles and functions. Graduates of the program are placed at an individual business based on their performance and feedback from their mentors.  We also offer an Accelerated Readiness Program focusing on advancing the business and leadership skills of employees leading large departments or branch offices.  This immersive 20 month program includes a blend of in-person group learning modules, executive coaching, and hands-on learning opportunities focused on real business challenges we face.  Our field-based leadership has the opportunity to participate in a development program focused on building foundational leadership skills.  This program is highly differentiated from many field-based programs, which tend to focus on technical competence, not leadership.   In addition, we offer less structured tools and opportunities for development, including executive coaching, strategic leadership advisory services and on-demand learning opportunities hosted on our learning management platform, our intranet site and through podcasts.  We monitor employee engagement through periodic engagement assessments and provide recommendations for follow up based on this work.
Health & Safety 
 We have a safety culture that is grounded in our commitment to zero incidents. We have established safety training and on-site safety programs throughout our operations to ensure that all employees comply with safety standards we have established and that are established under federal, state and local laws and regulations. We have implemented our safety program, STEPS (Striving Toward Excellence and Professionalism in Safety), which promotes safety culture awareness throughout our operations. We are also advancing our observation-based safety program which we feel can further enhance the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.  Additionally, we participate in an annual Safety Week which includes activities designed to elevate safety awareness and we hold an annual competition to acknowledge and reward businesses exhibiting excellence in safety. Safety audits are conducted by safety professionals at each business to ensure the highest safety standards are upheld. 
 Our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the OSHA per one hundred employees per year, also known as the OSHA recordable rate, was 1.3 and 1.2 during 2020 and 2019, respectively, less than half of the most recently published OSHA rate for our industry of 2.8.
 9

In response to COVID-19, we implemented various measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including work-from-home accommodations (where practical), social distancing and deep cleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions, among other measures, which measures comply with applicable governmental regulations and guidance.
 Competitive Pay, Benefits and Total Rewards and Practices 
 Our total rewards philosophy is designed to align the compensation of our employees with individual and Company performance, and to provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. In addition, we offer a company-paid assistance program to help employees and their families with mental health and other life challenges. In coordination with each country’s social welfare system, and in addition to any required local health care participation, we may provide additional health and welfare benefits depending on, among other things, the market competitiveness in that country.
