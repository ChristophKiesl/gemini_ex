Regional Geology:

The Malaysia Central Gold Belt runs along the entire backbone of Peninsular Malaysia, extending further to the north. It was formed between the Sibumasu block in the west and Manabor block in the east that runs along major mineral deposits in Thailand, Myanmar and China. The regional gold deposits were made of Epithermal deposits that formed in a series of volcanic environment, where the tensional fractures along the subduction zone allows the intrusion of mineral rich acidic magma within deep faults.
Rock Formations and Mineralization:

Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine covers an area of 400 acres with mineralization structure being Permian limestone dominating the South-East portion, felsic volcanic tuff in the Western portion of the area and intrusive dacite rock to the north-west of the area. Tectonic contact within the sheer zone of creates epithermal mineralization, forming a mineral rich vein along the contact zone. The mineralized zone is made of highly altered tuffacaous rock with abundant pyrite dissemination and a moderately spaced quartz vein.
Work Completed and Present Condition:

Lode gold exploration on Site IV-1 of Merapoh Gold Mine hashas commenced since 2011 and still in progress with both in-house drilling team and third party drilling services running in parallel to expedite data collection to generate a comprehensive JORC compliant gold reserve report. There was no gold ore extraction since 2019 and the company has been engaged on the sales of wash sand extracted from Site IV-1 of Merapoh Gold Mine to customers in Malaysia since January 2021.

Description of Processing Facilities:


Process for removing ore concentrates from the ore body


1. | The ore body is transported to the treatment plants in vehicles capable of hauling huge, heavy loads. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The ore body is separated into Ore Type 1 Stockpile and Ore Type 2 Stockpile. 
3. | The monitor washes finer gold bearing material off larger rocks which is screened on an inclined coarse wire screen.
4. | An excavator is used to turn over the rocks so wash is removed from all sides of the coarse material. 
5. | A monitor pushes the rock down the inclined coarse screen where the course is removed and stockpiled at the bottom. 
6. | Finer material passes through the mesh screen into the sluice system and runs over the sluice. 
7. | The carpets are removed and taken to refining facility for gold recovery. 
8. | A suction pipe recovers water of the fine tailings pond for use in the system. 


Refining of the concentrate


1. | The carpets holding concentrate from the sluice are brought to a shed in the camp site where the gold is refined. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The first stage of the refining is to wash the gold containing concentrate into large bins. This is pumped to a jig and shaking table. 
3. | Nuggets are handpicked from the coarse fraction and the fine fraction is amalgamated to remove the gold. After distillation, gold from the amalgam and the coarse are melted with flux and the gold is poured into small bars.

Current State of Exploration:

As of the date of this report, the Merapoh Gold Mine property is without known reserves.

The Merapoh Gold Mine commenced exploratory operation in alluvia mining and achieved its first gold pour in July 2011. Through the years of operation, the Company has performed ongoing exercises to improve upon the matching of processing method with the types of ore in order to optimize cost to recovery ratio. In July 2013, production was outsourced to a reputable subcontractor, and developed a resource management system to match ore against processes to achieve the most cost efficient and highest recovery production procedure.

There was no gold ore extraction of the Merapoh Gold Mine and no gold concentrate sold for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. We have generated other income from the sales of wash sand to customers in Malaysia.

Our revenues have been derived from gold production from the Merapoh Gold Mine, but currently there is no production from that mine and we are not certain there will be production in the future. We have generated other revenues through seeking new customers of wash sand sales during January to June 2021. Management continues to search for mining opportunities to generate revenues in the future.

Subcontractors

In an effort to enhance the efficiency of mine operations at the Merapoh Gold Mine, Champmark Sdn Bhd (“CSB”) entered into an Operation Term Sheet (“OTS”) agreement in July 2013 to outsource the exploitation works of alluvial gold resources at Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine to a third party subcontractor Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd (“BOG”). However, BOG became the Company’s shareholder in January 29, 2014, and was no longer a third party subcontractor.

BOG has the experience and local knowledge in managing the exploitation of alluvial gold at the Merapoh Gold Mine. The Company currently intends to continue to outsource the exploitation of alluvial gold at our mine site to BOG as our third party subcontractor. The Company will provide necessary disclosure when any significant agreements have been made with the sub-contractor in the future.

Number of Employees

The Company had 1 employee during the year from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.
