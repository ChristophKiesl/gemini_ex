ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (“Coda” “the Company” or “we”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, operates two distinct businesses:
 

● | the Marine Technology Business (also referred to in this Form 10-K as “Products Business”, “Products Operations” or “Products Segment”); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the Marine Engineering Business (also referred to in this Form 10-K as “Engineering Business”, “Engineering Operations”, or “Services Segment”). 

 
Our Marine Technology Business is a technology solution provider to the subsea and underwater market. It owns key proprietary sonar technology used for underwater commercial and defense applications. All design, development and manufacturing of our technology and solutions are performed within the Company. These products and solutions are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore wind energy industry (offshore renewables), and offshore oil and gas, complex dredging, port security, mining, fisheries and marine sciences sectors. Our volumetric real time sonar technology is our most promising product for the Group’s growth due to its unique capabilities including real time 3D visualization of moving objects underwater including in zero-visibility water conditions. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas (“O&G”) companies, renewable companies, underwater construction companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities. We are widely considered the leading solution providers for real time 3D visualization underwater.
 
Our Marine Engineering Business is a supplier of embedded solutions and sub-assemblies which they design and manufacture and sell into mission critical integrated defense systems such as the Close-In-Weapons System (CIWS). The Services Segment established its business in 1977 and has been supporting a number of significant defense programs for over 40 years, including Raytheon’s CIWS and Northrop Grumman’s Mine Hunting Systems Program. The Services Segment’s business model entails designing sub-assembly prototypes for defense programs which typically lead to contracts for the manufacture, repair and upgrade of these sub-assemblies. We are the sole source for the parts that we supply into these programs. This business model ensures recurring and long tail revenues since we continue to supply parts, typically for the life of the program, which can span decades. Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. and Coda Octopus Martech Ltd, each qualifies as a small business. This opens up opportunity under state requirements to collaborate with Prime Defense Contractors on these programs.
 
Due to the above, a significant part of the revenues generated by the Marine Engineering Business is highly concentrated and are derived from a small number of prime defense contractors such as Raytheon or Northrop. In any one year, between 20% to 30% of our consolidated revenues may be derived from these customers either alone or collectively.
 
The Services Segment operates through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (“Colmek”) based in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (“Martech”) based in the United Kingdom.
 
Our Products and Services operations have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skills set for robust, rugged and repeated engineering solutions relating to data acquisition, data computation and display of the data. Increasingly drawing on each part of the business strengths, the Marine Technology business and Marine Engineering Business work jointly on projects including responding jointly for tenders.
 
Our corporate structure is as follows:
 

Corporate History
 
The Company began as Coda Technologies Limited. This company now operates under the name Coda Octopus Products Limited, a United Kingdom corporation formed in 1994 as a start-up company with its origins as a research group at Herriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland. Initially, its operations consisted primarily of developing software for subsea mapping and visualization using sidescan sonar (a technology widely used in commercial offshore geophysical survey and naval mine-hunting to detect objects on, and textures of, the surface of the seabed).

In June 2002, we acquired Octopus Marine Systems Ltd, a UK corporation, and changed our name to Coda Octopus Limited. At the time of its acquisition, Octopus Marine Systems was producing geophysical products broadly similar to those of Coda, but targeted at the less sophisticated, easy-to-use, “work-horse” market. The Octopus Marine Systems acquisition led to the introduction of the Motion product (F180® series) into the Products Segment.
 
In December 2002, Coda Octopus Ltd acquired OmniTech AS, a Norwegian company, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and which subsequently changed its name to Coda Octopus R&D AS. OmniTech owned the patents to a “method for producing a 3-D Image” (which has now expired). At the time of acquisition, this company had been engaged for over ten years in developing a revolutionary imaging and visualization sonar technology capable of producing real time three-dimensional (“3D”) underwater images for use in subsea activities. Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh based) then developed the visualization software to control and display the images from the real time 3D sonar. This patented technology is now marketed by us under the brand name “Echoscope®”. All activities of this now-defunct Norwegian subsidiary have been transferred to Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh).
 
On July 13, 2004, the Company effected a reverse merger pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement between The Panda Project, Inc. (“Panda”), a Florida corporation, and a now defunct entity affiliated with Coda Octopus Ltd. (“Coda Parent”). Panda acquired the shares of Coda Octopus Limited, a UK corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coda Parent, in consideration for the issuance of a total of 1,432,143 shares of common stock to Coda Parent and other shareholders of Coda Octopus Limited. The shares issued represented approximately 90.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Panda. The share exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Panda by Coda. Subsequently, Panda was reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Coda Octopus Group, Inc.
 
In June 2006, we acquired Coda Octopus Martech Limited which is part of our Services Segment or Marine Engineering Business. This is an English corporation.
 
In April 2007, we acquired Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. which is part of our Services Segment or Marine Engineering Business. This is a Utah corporation.
 
Both Martech and Colmek largely have the same business model, provide similar engineering services and sell to a similar customer base (one is UK focused and the other is US focused).
 
Coda Octopus Group, Inc., is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a holding company that conducts its business through subsidiaries, several of which are organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, including England, Scotland, Denmark and Australia. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries. These companies’ operations must comply with the laws of the countries under which they are incorporated and are likely to be different from the equivalent laws of the United States.

Marine Technology Business (“Products Segment”)
 
Our Marine Technology Business develops proprietary solutions for both the commercial and defense subsea market. The range of our solutions are complementary and include:
 

● | Geophysical Systems comprising hardware and software; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Motion and Positioning Systems comprising hardware and software; and 
● | Real Time Volumetric Imaging Sonar comprising hardware and software. 

 
These products are sold, leased or rented into various marine sectors and include:
 

● | Marine geophysical survey 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | Underwater construction 
● | Diving 
● | Salvage and decommissioning 
● | Oil and gas 
● | Commercial fisheries 
● | Environmental, mammal and habitat monitoring 
● | Defense 
● | Marine vehicles and robotics 
● | Security, law enforcement and first responders 
● | Research and education 

1. Geophysical Range of Products
 
Our geophysical systems (“GEO”) range of products include geophysical data acquisition systems, processing and analysis software that are used primarily by survey companies, research institutions, salvage companies and, more recently, offshore energy and renewables operators. These systems are used to survey large areas and create images of the seabed, identify seabed boulders and objects, mark seabed type boundaries and identify existing subsurface structural features, geological layers, and/or buried debris.
 
2. GPS aided Inertial Positioning Systems
 
These are referred to as our MOTION range of products and offer high accuracy GPS aided inertial positioning and attitude data, essential for all marine survey applications. The products are commonly bundled with our GEO and real time sonar solutions offering our customers a seamless integration and support experience.
 
3. Real Time Volumetric Imaging Sonars (ranging from 3D/4D, 5D and 6D)
 
We design, develop and supply what we believe is the world’s most advanced series of real time volumetric imaging sonar. This is the culmination of over 25 years of research and development. This technology is protected by multiple patents. Furthermore, we continue to file patents relating to our new and revolutionary sonars, our 5-Dimensional (5D) and 6-Dimensional (6D) real time volumetric imaging sonars (marketed under the name Echoscope® PIPE (Parallel Intelligent Processing Engine). Our sonar innovations are multi-tiered and extend to hardware, firmware and software, all of which co-exist and are co-dependent on each other. In other words, hardware, firmware and software operate as sub-systems to each other. We believe that the highly complex nature of this new technology will make it extremely difficult to reverse engineer our products. Pioneering this unique technology gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in the subsea imaging sonar market sectors. We also believe that our three-tier product development capability of hardware, software and solution delivery adds to our competitive lead.
 
We believe that this technology is superior to the other imaging sonars in the market as it generates real time 3D, 4D, 5D and 6D images of the underwater environment irrespective of low or zero visibility conditions and, unlike conventional sonars, can image a volume (as opposed to a slice of data) and subsea moving objects.
 
Sonar Hardware
 
During fiscal 2019, we completed critical innovation and advancement milestones around our core volumetric real time sonar technology. We have now introduced the world’s first 5D and 6D series of volumetric imaging sonar technology. We believe our 5D and 6D series of sonars heralds a significant leap forward in real time subsea imaging as this inventive capability allows a single sonar to provide to different parts of the survey operations multiple real time data sets (as opposed to one 3D dataset) for each part of the survey teams’ requirements.

-


We believe that our real time volumetric imaging sonar products are revolutionizing the sonar market due to the following unique capabilities:
 

A. | Live 3D imaging of any moving objects within the sonar field of view including construction assets, divers, subsea vehicles and tools and machinery executing tasks underwater. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. | Accurate three-dimensional data unaffected by motion or water visibility. 
C. | Mapping of complex structures with a volumetric ping as opposed to individual angular slices of data. The more complex the structure, the greater the benefit of real-time volumetric sonar imaging over a traditional survey. 
D. | Live situational awareness of static and moving objects for safe terrain navigation or target tracking. 
E. | First Person Perspective imaging allowing the operator to point the real-time volumetric imaging sonar towards any target, regardless of where in the water column the target is located and generate a true first person perspective image. 
F. | Imaging or visualizing subsea environments in low or zero visibility conditions and in situations of high waterflow and active noise pollution (dredging and rock dumping). 
G. | 3D Range gating of the live image to focus on specific targets or features at specified ranges – regardless of signal strength. This specifically allows for weak targets close to the sonar to be discarded from the image (e.g. bubbles or fish) or detected as threats (e.g. fishing nets). 
H. | Coherent single sensor delivery for multiple applications. 
I. | Unique rendering and viewing software techniques that simplifies data interpretation. 
J. | Direct integration with a range of compatible sensors (e.g. GPS, attitude sensors), actuators (pan and tilt) and custom, task-specific software that provides task or mission solutions for key markets such as the underwater construction market and offshore wind energy sector. 



Prior to January 2018, we were selling our third generation (3G) sonar series. In January 2018 we launched the first product within our fourth generation series of sonars (“4G sonar series”). The 4G sonar series is an important development milestone for the Company. Due to the form factor of our previous generation of 3G sonar series this limited the types of subsea vessels/vehicles this generation of sonar could be integrated on (and therefore be used for) due to (i) size; (ii) weight and (iii) power requirements (“form factor barriers”). With the launch of the 4G sonar series we have removed these form factor barriers and can now integrate on the majority of underwater vehicles in the market including the new and fast emerging smaller underwater vehicles such as autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) which are propelling growth in the underwater market.
 
The 4G sonar series developments were largely form factor driven as opposed to being based on performance and capability advancements. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020 we continued our innovation of our sonar technology to focus on performance and capability advancements, particularly on the beamforming and the data processing capability of our sonar series. In the previous generation of our sonars, due to limitations in processing capability technology there were restrictions on how much of the captured sonar data could be processed. Our previous generations of sonars processed 16,384 pieces of data per sonar ping (compared to around 256 pieces of data per sonar ping for competing technology such as the multibeam). Under our new 5D/6D sonars series for each signal that is generated by the sonar we receive back up to 40 million pieces of information which we can now process. We believe that this advancement allows us to deliver to the market the first 5-Dimensional (5D) sonar and 6-Dimensional (6D) sonar capabilities and significantly builds on our 4G sonar series. Our 5D capability allows customers to collect full time series 4D backscatter data in real time. Our 6D capability allows customers to use a single sonar for multiple simultaneous real time data sets using different real time capture and processing parameters (such as range, frequency and field of view).
 
The 4G sonar series development which we launched in 2018 now combined with the performance and capability advancements (5D and 6D capability) crystalizes the completion of the main pillars of development plans for our real time volumetric sonar series. We believe these achievements are critical milestones in the Company’s growth strategy and also distinguishes our sonar capabilities from all other imaging sonar offerings in the market. This will enable us to refocus a significant part of our spending from R&D to marketing and business development post-Pandemic.

The following diagram outlines the capability summary progression as we transition from our current Real-Time 3D (4D) volumetric imaging sonar system to 5D and then 6D.
 

Sonar Software
 
Our software development capability is an important part of our strategy to maintain our lead in designing, manufacturing and selling state-of-the-art real time volumetric imaging sonars.
 
Our existing third generation (3G) Underwater Survey Explorer software used in conjunction with our real time volumetric sonars, is a product which we have been developing for over 15 years. Because of technological advancements, including access to off the shelf components for more advanced processing of data (speed and size being factors), in 2016, the Company started the process of re-conceiving and developing its top-end software for our now much more advanced sonars. In this connection, in 2019, we launched for customer evaluation our 4th Gen of top-end software for our sonars – 4G Underwater Survey Explorer (“4G USE®”). We have also filed several provisional patents around our 4G USE®.
 
Our 3G Underwater Survey Explorer software is feature rich and offers advanced processing and application focused capabilities for various markets. 3G USE has been in the market for over 15 years. While this generation of our software is a mature and feature rich product, communication and graphics processing technologies have advanced considerably over recent years, allowing (for example) improved methods for processing larger volumes of data and leveraging new capabilities in recent PC hardware and the GPU.
 
Our new 4G USE® software is a ground-up development based on the latest processor capabilities and software architecture. 4G USE® will offer a completely new level of real-time visualization and automation processing to complement our recent sonar launches including our 5D and 6D sonars. The initial release of 4G USE® allows multiple devices being utilized simultaneously (example multiple sonars, rotators and inertial and positioning systems) and viewing the real-time data result in a consolidated image. 4G USE® which is also subject to a number of patent applications, is designed as an enterprise class platform, allowing many users access and control of data in real-time for better collaboration, tighter quality control, remote surveying and faster processing.

Our software packages are feature rich and include techniques which are the subject of patents in a number of our modules. In general, our software package contains significant capabilities that are designed to enable surveying a dynamic subsea setting (as opposed to a static mapping of the seabed as is typical for conventional sonar technology). Some of our unique features include:
 

Feature Description | Functionality 
---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real Time Measurements | important for many types of subsea operations such as block or asset placements or aiding diving operations; 
Models + Software Module | allows the user to import existing models and engineering drawings into the real time subsea environment; 
Edge Detection Algorithm | allows the user to superimpose an edge to easily identify a subsea target; 
Rendering a Noise Free Image | allows for a crisp, clear and high-resolution photo-like image without any processing (which would be required for conventional sonars); and 
Tracking Algorithm | Algorithm is used to track known objects within the real time 3D Data. This is currently utilized in our Construction Monitoring Software Package (see below) 

 
Our Echoscope® PIPE (the first 6-Dimensional Sonar) will also bring significant capabilities to include multiple parallel processing (enabling different parameters to be set and utilized) in real time mode. We are not aware of any sonars that can offer this capability. This will allow multiple tasks and users of the real time data simultaneously, thus increasing efficiency and enabling tasks which were previously impossible.
 
Geophysical Products and Solutions
 
We started our business in 1994 designing and developing the CodaOctopus® GeoSurvey software and hardware package for acquisition and processing of sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler data. For over two decades, our GeoSurvey has been an industry leading software package in the market for data acquisition and interpretation and provides feature rich solutions and productivity enhancing tools for the most exacting survey requirements. Designed specifically for sidescan and sub-bottom data acquisition, CodaOctopus® GeoSurvey has been purchased by numerous leading survey companies throughout the world.


The Products Business generates around 5% of its revenues from this range of products. With the launch of the new products based on Artificial Intelligence technology for which we believe there is increased demand we would anticipate our revenues from this line to increase over time.
 
Geophysical Hardware
 
These consist of a range of hardware solutions for field acquisition of sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler, which includes analog and digital interfaces compatible with all geophysical survey systems.
 
In 2018, we introduced our DA4G-USB product. This allows customers to integrate the DA4G hardware into their own PC configuration. Based on the CodaOctopus® DA4G system, it offers the same functionality, robustness and ease of use. CodaOctopus® DA4G is the 4th generation of our successful DA series and is built on twenty years of knowledge, experience and innovation in supplying unparalleled products and service to the worldwide geophysical survey sector. These purpose-built, turn-key, systems incorporate the very latest hardware specifications and are designed and delivered to meet the demanding nature of offshore survey work.
 
The CodaOctopus® DA4G range consists of a number of options and is backed (like all our products) with global service and support.
 
This consists of an integrated suite of software that automates the tasks of analyzing, annotating and mosaicing complex data sets, thus ensuring faster and more precise results.
 
Geophysical Software
 
Our CodaOctopus® GeoSurvey software is supplied to complement our DA4G hardware, offering field acquisition of sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler data.
 
Our Survey Engine software product offers a more advanced post-processing solution for sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler data. Designed to streamline processing of very large data sets – many 100GBs – it offers comprehensive processing, interpretation, visualization, reporting and exporting functionality.
 
We continue to advance this range of products and in 2018 we launched our first product based on Artificial Intelligence techniques which allows us to automatically identify boulders on the seabed (“Survey Engine Automatic Object Detection (SEADP)”). This new product presents a real opportunity to radically change workflow process for post-processing and analyzing side scan sonar data to assess, among other things, the suitability of an area for exploration and construction activities (O&G installations, pipeline and cable laying activities). This is in its early stage of roll out and has sparked significant interest. This is an area where we are investing our research and development efforts.

Additionally, in 2019 we introduced our Seabed Classification module (again based on Artificial Intelligence techniques). This automatically classifies sidescan sonar imagery into different seabed types, computes and exports polygonal boundaries for these areas, and thereby simplifies sidescan processing.
 
Inertial Positioning and Attitude Measurement Systems (“Motion Products”)
 
Our Motion Products are Global Navigational Satellite System (referred to in the industry as “GNSS” Aided Inertial Measurement Units) provide measurement data on the position and attitude of a vessel.  This device provides real-time data on these measurements which are applied to compensate for vessel movement in order to align sonar data and remove motion blur.


We have had our F180® series in the market for over 15 years. These systems are used either alone and then paired with third parties multibeam sonars or used in conjunction with our volumetric real time sonars.   This technology has been developed for the marine environment and is based on technology originally developed for the extreme world of motor racing. Modifications and enhancements have resulted in a simple-to-use, off-the-shelf product that brings accurate positioning and motion data into extreme offshore conditions for precision marine survey applications worldwide. Variants within the F180® series include the F190, exclusively configured for use ‘near-land’, e.g., within ports and harbors, and the F185, with enhanced precision positioning to 1cm accuracy (<0.5”). Coda Octopus iHeave, an intelligent software product for dealing with long period ocean swell compensation, is fully integrated within the F180® series.
 
New Generation of Motion Products
 
We have now completed the ground up development of our new generation of Motion Products (F280®). The new F280 is based on more advanced technology, more accurate than our F180® series. The new technology is much more scalable towards future development of new product variants. The F280® series is highly complementary to our real time volumetric sonar series and they are packaged together to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers. The F280 is sold with and without our sonar series.
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our products primarily through our website, industry events, webinars and industry relationships. We also have an internal sales and marketing team which is engaged in marketing and selling our products. In addition, we have a network of non-exclusive independent global sales agents.
 
Coda Octopus Products Limited has the requisite accreditations for its business including being Lloyds Register accredited to ISO 9001:2015 and Cyber Essentials certification.

Marine Engineering Businesses (“Service Segment”)
 
Our Marine Engineering Businesses comprise Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. based in Salt Lake City and Coda Octopus Martech Limited based in the United Kingdom.
 
These two operating entities supply engineered sub-assembly solutions which form part of mission critical integrated defense systems, test equipment, instrumentation and the like. They operate as sub-contractors to prime defense contractors and their engineering solutions are typically within broader defense programs where high levels of reliability and quality are essential pre-requisites for securing and maintaining these agreements with their customers. Typically, we prototype products for these customers and after going through various acceptance tests, including first article inspection approvals, we are given the production contracts. Many of these production contracts have a repeat orders profile which typically follows the life cycle of the defense program that is using the production part.
 
These arrangements often give us long term preferred/sole supplier status for the parts we supply, technology refresh and obsolescence management business opportunities with these customers and we generally use these long-standing relationships to win more contracts with these customers.
 
This business relies on increasing the number of new programs it attracts annually.
 
In addition, we are increasingly combining our engineering capabilities with our product offerings. This enables us to offer systems which are complete with installation and support to maximize the utilization of our collective expertise to advance our real time volumetric sonar technology.
 
Coda Octopus Martech Limited (“Martech”)
 
Martech operates in the specialized niche of bespoke design and manufacturing services mainly to the United Kingdom defense and subsea industries. Its services are provided on a custom sub-contract basis where high quality and high integrity devices are required in small quantities.
 
The Company enjoys pre-approvals to allow it to be short-listed for certain types of government contracts. Much of the more significant business secured by Martech is through the formal government or government contractor tendering process. Government contracts may be terminated at any time at the discretion of the government. If the government does terminate a contract, the Company is allowed to recover the costs incurred up to the date of termination. During the last few years, only one non-material government contract was terminated for convenience.

To this end, we have now designed and developed our next generation of the Thermite® “Octal”. The new Octal is in trials with a number of new customers who fit the profile of large quantity purchasers with repeat and long-term requirements for this product. The coronavirus Pandemic has interrupted the completion of these trials. The Thermite is one of our key growth catalysts.


Other products offered by Colmek include subsea telemetry and data acquisition systems, rugged workstations, analog-to-digital converters and rugged LCD displays.
 
Competition
 
In our Products Segment, we are exposed to the following competitive challenges:
 
Data Acquisition Products (GEO Products)
 
The sonar equipment industry is fragmented with several companies occupying niche areas, and we face competition from different companies with respect to our different products. In the field of geophysical products, Triton Imaging Inc., a US-based company, now part of the ECA Group (Toulon, France), Chesapeake, a US-based company, and Oceanic Imaging Consultants, Hawaii, USA, dominate the market with an estimated 25% each of world sales, while we believe that we control approximately 5% of world-wide sales.

Inertial Positioning and Attitude Measurement Systems (“Motion Products”)


In the field of motion sensing equipment, where our product addresses a small part of the overall market, we believe that we have four principal competitors: TSS (International) Ltd in Watford, England which is focused on the mid-performance segments with about 25% of the world market; Ixsea, a French company which covers all segments, with about 20% of the market; Kongsberg Seatex, a Norwegian company (part of Kongsberg Gruppen) which has products across all segments, with about 15% of the market; and Applanix, a Canadian company, now part of Trimble which has one major product focused on the high end of the market, with about 20% of the market. We believe that our market share in the field of motion sensing equipment is only about 5%. This market is fiercely competitive and with the advancement of technology, there are new entrants to the market such as SBG Systems (a French based manufacturer of motion sensors). Due to the price pressure in this market, we are selling our products more in conjunction with our real time 3D sonars than on a standalone basis. However, with the development of our new F280®product, this gives us the opportunity to increase our market share.
Real Time Volumetric Sonar
 
In the field of Real Time 3D/4D/5D imaging, we are unaware of other companies offering a similar product. The entry into this market is dependent upon specialized marine electronics, acoustic and software development skills. The learning curve, which has resulted in the advancement of our real time 3D sonar device, is the culmination of two decades of research and development into this field. Companies such as Tritech International Ltd., United Kingdom, BlueView Technologies Inc., USA (now a part of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated), and Norbit Group AS Norway are examples, but none of these sonar offerings are directly comparable or competitors to our real time volumetric sonar solutions. Specifically, we believe that they do not have the same capabilities as our Echoscope® technology in terms of generating real time 3D, 4D, 5D and 6D images of moving objects underwater including in environments in low or zero visibility conditions. Nor the ability to use a single sonar for multiple real time 3D images simultaneously. Notwithstanding it should be noted that Teledyne has acquired a significant number of substantial subsea companies (examples are Reson and BlueView). Teledyne has much greater resources, liquidity and market reach than our Company and has many operating verticals. We therefore can give no assurance that companies such as these will not enter this market. Notwithstanding, we believe that our recent development and introduction of 5D/6D - Echoscope PIPE®) sonar capability further distinguishes our volumetric sonars and significantly extends our lead over competitors in the subsea imaging market. We are not aware of any other imaging sonars in the market capable of generating real time 5D and 6D imagery underwater. The innovations around Echoscope PIPE® are the subject of numerous patent applications.
 
We seek to compete on the basis of producing high quality products employing cutting edge technology that is easy to use by operators without specialized skills in sonar technology. We intend to continue our research and development activities to continually improve our products, seek new applications for our existing products, to develop new innovative products and grow the market for our products and expertise.
 
In our Services Segment, we are exposed to the following competitive challenges:
 
Marine Engineering Businesses
 
Through our marine engineering operations, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. and Coda Octopus Martech Limited, we are involved in custom engineering for the defense industry in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Martech competes with larger contractors in the defense industry. Typical among these are Ultra Electronics, BAE Systems, and Thales, all of whom are also partners on various projects. In addition, the strongest competitors are often the clients themselves. Because of their size, they often have the option to proceed with a project in-house instead of outsourcing to a sub-contractor like Martech or Colmek.
Intellectual Property
 
Our product portfolio and technologies are protected by intellectual property rights including trademarks, copyrights and patents. In the last 2 years we have advanced our existing sonar technology and have filed a number of significant patents applications pertaining to these inventions including covering our newly innovated 5D and 6D sonars.
Patents
 
Our patented inventions along with our strategy to enhance these inventions are at the heart of the Company’s strategy for growth and development.

Research and Development
 
Research and Development is foundational to our business strategy to ensure our growth strategy and maintain our competitiveness. During the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2019, we spent $3,188,389 and $2,801,331 (a 13.8% increase), respectively, on Research and Development. With the crystallization of our sonar series developments and our F280® inertial navigation system, we would expect R&D expenditures in this area to be less in 2021 fiscal year.
 
Our products are complex and therefore we can give no assurance that even with spending a significant part of our resources on R&D, we will be successful in our development goals. Furthermore, even following launch of any product we may not succeed. Moreover, we may incur significant research and development expenditures without realizing viable products.

Government Regulation
 
Because of the nature of some of our products, they may be subject to export control regimes including in the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark and Australia where we conduct business operations. Where our products are subject to such export control requirements, they may only be exported to our customers if there is a valid export license granted by the relevant government body. Moreover, these regulations may change from time to time in these jurisdictions, including the United States, depending on the existing relationship with the country to which the goods are exported. See Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation) for further discussion on this.
 
We are also required to maintain certain accreditations such as ISO accreditation, cyber security certifications, approvals to hold government items or materials and/or certain personnel or facility clearances.
 
In addition, as a provider for the US Government, we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of US Government contracts, including the False Claims Act. Non-compliance found by any one agency could result in fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all US Government agencies. Given our dependence on US Government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
