 Strategy

Our primary objective is to build stakeholder value through profitable growth in our core product lines with disciplined use of capital and a strong customer focus.

Principal components of our strategy include the following:

• | Continuously improving the efficiency, productivity and quality of our products and services and their respective delivery to our customers, in order to grow revenues and operating margins from our core operations (Formation Evaluation and Well Construction and Completion and Production) and Land Drilling Rigs in all of our geographic markets at a rate exceeding underlying market activity;


• | A commitment to the innovation, invention and integration, development and commercialization of new products and service that meet the evolving needs of our customers across the reservoir lifecycle; and


• | Further extending the process, productivity, service quality, safety and competency across our global infrastructure to meet client demands for our core products and services in an operationally efficient manner.

Markets

We are a leading provider of equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Demand for our industry’s services and products depends upon commodity prices for oil and gas, the number of oil and natural gas wells drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of wells, the number of well completions, the depletion and age of existing wells and the level of workover activity worldwide.
Technology has become increasingly critical to the oil and natural gas marketplace as a result of the maturity of the world’s oil and natural gas reservoirs, the acceleration of production decline rates and the focus on complex well designs, including deepwater prospects. Clients continue to seek, test and use production-enabling technologies at an increasing rate. We have invested a substantial amount of our time and resources into building our technology offerings, which helps us to provide our clients with more efficient tools to find and produce oil and natural gas. We believe our products and services enable our clients to reduce their costs of drilling and production, increase production rates, or both. Furthermore, these offerings afford us additional opportunities to sell our core products and services to our clients.

Other Business Data

Competition
We provide our products and services worldwide and compete in a variety of distinct segments with a number of competitors. Our principal competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes (which is expected to be acquired by GE Oil and Gas in 2017), National Oilwell Varco, Noble Energy, Nabors Industries and Frank’s International. We also compete with various other regional suppliers that provide a limited range of equipment and services tailored for local markets. Competition is based on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, in some cases, breadth of products. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors – The oilfield services business is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.”
Raw Materials

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials as well as parts and components made by other manufacturers and suppliers for use in our manufacturing. Many of the products or components of products sold by us are manufactured by other parties. We are not dependent in any material respect on any single supplier for our raw materials or purchased components.

Customers

Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our international sales are to large international or national oil companies and these sales have resulted in a concentration of receivables from certain national oil companies worldwide, especially in Latin America. As of December 31, 2016, Latin America accounted for 38% of our net outstanding accounts receivables. Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico represent 43%, 16% and 10%, respectively, of the Latin America balance. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, no individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. 
Backlog 
Our services are usually short-term in nature, day-rate based and cancellable should our customer wish to alter the scope of work. Consequently, our backlog of firm orders is not material to the Company.
Research, Development and Patents

We maintain world-class technology and training centers throughout the world. Additionally, we have research, development and engineering facilities that are focused on improving existing products and services and developing new technologies to meet customer demands for improved drilling performance and enhanced reservoir productivity. Weatherford has also developed significant expertise, trade secrets, and know-how with respect to manufacturing equipment and providing services. Our expenditures for research and development totaled $159 million in 2016, $231 million in 2015 and $290 million in 2014.

As many areas of our business rely on patents and proprietary technology, we seek patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We amortize patents over the years that we expect to benefit from their existence, which typically extends from the grant of the patent through and until 20 years after the filing date of the patent application. 

Although in the aggregate our patents are important to the manufacturing and marketing of many of our products and services, we do not believe that the expiration of any one of our patents would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Seasonality

Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the level of demand for our products and services. Spring months in Canada and winter months in the North Sea and Russia can affect our operations negatively. Additionally, heavy rains or an exceedingly cold winter in a given region or climate changes may impact our results. The unpredictable impact of climate changes or unusually harsh weather conditions could lengthen the periods of reduced activity and have a detrimental impact to our results of operations. The widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate the overall impact of the seasonal nature of our business.
Federal Regulation and Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. In December 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) conducted an investigation and records review regarding our pressure pumping facilities for perceived violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). The EPA has alleged that we failed to meet RCRA notification requirements and failed to operate within its stated generator status. During 2016, we settled and paid a fine of $335,200 related to this matter.
Our 2016 expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations were not material, and we currently do not expect the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations for 2017 to be material.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 30,000 employees, which is 24% and 46% lower than our workforce as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In response to the significant decline in the price of crude oil and a lower level of exploration and production spending, we reduced our overall costs and workforce to better align with anticipated activity levels starting in 2014 and throughout 2015 and 2016. See “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 – Restructuring Charges” for details on our workforce reductions. Certain of our operations are subject to union contracts and these contracts cover approximately 17% of our employees. We believe we have a highly motivated and capable workforce despite the significant headcount reductions over the past two years, which were necessary to adapt our Company to the difficult market conditions.
