Products and Services 
 
Our current products include Touchpoint Mapping and McorpCX | Persona. We also provide professional and related services such as research, training, strategy consulting and process optimization. Together, our products and services are designed to help organizations improve customer experiences, increase customer loyalty, reduce costs and increase revenue. We serve a wide variety of industries and customer sizes.
  
Customer experience (CX) is defined as the sum of all experiences a customer has with a company, its goods and its services, across various touchpoints and over the duration of their relationship with that company. Customer experience management (CXM) is a series of disciplines, methodologies and processes used to comprehensively understand, plan, measure and manage a customer’s experiences, with the goal of improving customer perceptions. According to a 2015 Gartner, Inc. survey a majority of corporate executives surveyed stated that customer experience management is an important part of their organization’s strategic agenda, and according to a 2013 survey by Oracle Corporation most corporate executives believe experience management is critical to their future success.
  
While we believe that there are multiple reasons for this, we believe that some of the most widely recognized include the ability of an improved customer experience to help an organization increase customer loyalty, better compete in otherwise commoditized businesses, and drive greater revenue.

Software
 
While the customer experience management ecosystem is broad and complex, our software solutions are primarily designed to help mostly large and medium sized organizations better understand their customers while measuring and improving their customer’s experience over time based on those insights. 
 
Development of our software is ongoing, as both Touchpoint Mapping and McorpCX | Persona are being refined and improved based on customer feedback, and customized for specific organizations and industry sectors. The services delivered with our products may include consulting and additional research services, as well as services such as assessment, integration, implementation and additional offline analysis and reporting of data.
 
Touchpoint Mapping® 
 
Touchpoint Mapping is a research-based software solution designed to provide insights to organizations that can help them improve customer and employee experience, brand, and loyalty. It is designed to be a solution for customer-centric organizations to measure and gather customer data across all their touchpoints, channels and interactions with their customers. Data is analyzed and can be displayed across multiple axes including customer segments, location, time and many other variables of interest to personnel within an organization. 
 
The first version of Touchpoint Mapping was released in 2013. Pricing of Touchpoint Mapping varies based on breadth of insights sought, number of employees, number of customers and customer segments, frequency of insights gathered and other variables. 
 
Touchpoint Mapping is delivered through a cloud-based platform. The platform provides access to survey deployment, gives the ability to manage customer data, and facilitates access to customer-driven business intelligence (BI) by displaying data in a series of online dashboards. 
 

McorpCX | Persona
 
McorpCX | Persona, another online SaaS solution, is designed for developing and managing customer persona, as well as automating the currently manual process of developing, managing and sharing persona across corporations. It is designed to improve the results of customer facing initiatives, and to help customer-centric businesses and the agencies and consultancies that serve them to better understand, connect with and serve their customers. 
 
McorpCX | Persona was released in September of 2016. Pricing of McorpCX | Persona varies based on breadth of persona managed, the number of collaborators, projects and customer journeys, the degree of customization desired and other variables. 
 
McorpCX | Persona is delivered through a cloud-based platform. The platform provides the ability to create, manage, access and share customer persona, with intention of helping to digitize and automate the persona development process. 
 

Professional Services 
 
MCorpCX, Inc. provides professional and related consulting services including customer experience management consulting in the areas of research, strategy development, planning, education, training and best practices, and includes the articulation of customer-centric strategies and implementation roadmaps in support of these strategies. 
 
These services are intended to help primarily large and medium sized organizations plan, design and deliver better customer experiences. They are intended to improve our customers’ ability to design and deliver better customer experiences, help our customers maximize their return on investment, improve our customers' efficiency, and increase our customers' adoption of our products and services.

Our software-enabled services leverage the analytical frameworks of, and in many cases the data gathered through, our software, with a particular focus on analytical solutions in support of customer experience improvement.
 
Our Strategy

Since our founding, we have been focused on customer experience improvement. The methodologies we developed and delivered as a professional services firm since that time form the foundation for our software and software enabled services today, as well as continue to guide the delivery of our professional services. After making a decision to focus on the development of on-demand and software-enabled solutions which automated significant aspects of our business, we released the initial version of our cloud-based software to a broader market in 2013. 
 
While professional services continue to represent a majority of our revenue, our belief is that a combination of growing market demand for customer experience management solutions and increasing market adoption of on-demand, cloud-based software will help to pave the way for future growth of our company through distributed, cloud-based technology solutions delivered through direct sales as well as indirect sales through planned partner and reseller distribution channels. 
 
There are many potential unforeseen and significant market and competitive risks associated our current products and services. Though we released the first version of Touchpoint Mapping in 2013, and we released the first version of McorpCX | Persona in 2016, we cannot predict the timing or probability of generating material sales revenue from them. As of this filing, we have yet to engage the necessary sales and marketing staff or the capabilities required to identify, develop, and close material product sales opportunities, and currently lack sufficient resources to market and sell our products in the manner which we believe is required to achieve our product sales and revenue growth objectives. It is our expectation that numerous unforeseen challenges will be encountered as we continue to develop, market, distribute and sell our products and services. We cannot assure you that that we will be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors, or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.
 
Our ability to achieve our objectives will stem in large part from our ability to successfully commercialize our software products, the licensing and adoption of our systems and methodologies, and the development of direct and indirect sales and distribution channels through which we can distribute our products and services. 
 
Competition

The market for customer experience management solutions is highly competitive and increasingly fragmented. It is subject to rapidly changing technology, shifting organizational priorities and requirements, frequent introductions of new products and services, and increased marketing activities of other industry participants. 
 
Multiple competitors exist in the overlapping areas of on-demand and traditional marketing research, customer relationship management (CRM) and Digital Experience Management (DXM) software, management consulting and customer experience management consulting. For example, many CRM software companies include customer experience-specific insights as adjunct capabilities to their existing platforms, and others have rebranded their existing CRM software or customer satisfaction research software as customer experience software, which has the potential to create unforeseen competitive barriers and market confusion. 
 
Many of our current and potential competitors have a larger market presence, greater name recognition, access to more potential customers and substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, management, support and other resources than we have. As a result, many of our competitors are able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities and technologies, and may devote greater resources to the marketing, promotion and sale of their products than we can. 
 
Given the growth of customer experience management as a business discipline and on-demand software as a way for companies to better understand and manage customer experiences across their business, there are likely many competitors we have not identified. Additionally, we expect that new competitors will continue to enter the customer experience management and on-demand customer experience software markets with competing products and services as the market continues to rapidly develop and mature.

We believe it is highly likely that existing and new competitors will rapidly acquire significant market share, which could negatively impact our ability to effectively market, compete and sell our products and services into the markets in which such competitors operate. 
 

Dependence on Major Customers
 
The Company sells its products and services under various terms to a broad range of companies across multiple industries ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, with sales concentrated among a few large clients. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of the Company’s total sales to its largest customer was 20.09% and 41.6%, respectively, while sales to the Company’s second largest customer accounted for 19.57% and 12.44%, respectively of the Company’s total sales over those same time periods. See “Note 8 Concentrations” in the Notes to Financial Statements in this report. 
Research and Development
 
We engage in the development of Software as a Service (SaaS) technology. Research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expenses as incurred and capitalization of such costs begins when technological feasibility is established. Capitalized software development costs, net of amortization, were $398,506 and $61,224 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Software development costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased investments in software development following the February 2, 2016 completion of a $2,745,000 private placement and listing of the Company’s common stock on the TSX Venture Exchange. This increase included capitalization of a certain portion of salaries and wages totaling $229,108, as well as an aggregate cost for independent software designers, developers, programmers and project management professionals of $443,521.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on our trademark and other intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, such as assignment, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the technology and intellectual property used in our business. We actively pursue registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States.
 
As of December 31, 2016 we own four issued U.S. trademarks. The issued U.S. trademarks that we own are expected to expire between August 2020 and February 2027. Trademarks are Touchpoint Mapping, MCORP, Loyalty Mapping and Touchpoint Metrics. 
 
Our applications use a combination of “open source” software and technology we license from third parties. Open source software is made available to the general public in source code form for use, modification and redistribution on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. Though the third-party technology we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technology would be available to us.
 
Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, and other technology and intellectual property created by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to our software, source code and other proprietary information.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain health, dental, workmen’s compensation, general liability, commercial auto, and professional liability/E&O insurance policies.
