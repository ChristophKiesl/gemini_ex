Overview
We are the industry leader in our commitment to non-opioid pain management and regenerative health solutions to improve patients’ journeys along the neural pain pathway. Our corporate mission is to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as possible using enhanced recovery after surgery (“ERAS”) multimodal protocols and opioids for rescue only. To that end, we are advancing a three-part growth strategy focusing on: (i) expanding the utilization of EXPAREL and iovera°, our non-opioid pain therapies; (ii) pursuing innovative opioid-sparing options through in-licensing and acquisition and (iii) advancing a pipeline of non-opioid opportunities for acute and chronic pain management.
EXPAREL was approved by the FDA in October 2011 and was commercially launched in April 2012. EXPAREL is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Since its initial approval in 2011 for single-dose infiltration, more than eight million patients have been treated with EXPAREL. EXPAREL consists of bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, encapsulated in DepoFoam, our proprietary extended release drug delivery technology, that delivers bupivacaine over time for extended analgesia. We believe that EXPAREL addresses a significant medical need for a safe and effective long-acting non-opioid postsurgical analgesic and plays a significant role in opioid minimization strategies. EXPAREL is designed for recovery with minimal opioid use by (i) delivering targeted local analgesia at the surgical site; (ii) reliably releasing bupivacaine over time for prolonged analgesia; (iii) eliminating the need for catheters and pumps that may hinder recovery; and (iv) providing long-lasting pain control while reducing the need for opioids. Our net product sales of EXPAREL in 2020 were $413.3 million. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net product sales of EXPAREL accounted for 96%, 97% and 98% of our total revenues, respectively. In addition to EXPAREL, DepoFoam is also the basis for future clinical candidates.
In April 2019, we completed the MyoScience Acquisition and added the iovera° system to our commercial offering. The iovera° system is an FDA-approved, non-opioid handheld cryoanalgesia device used to produce precise, controlled doses of cold temperature only to targeted nerves, which has been FDA 510(k) cleared for use in pain applications since March 2014. The iovera° system is highly complementary to EXPAREL as a non-opioid therapy that alleviates pain using a non-pharmacological nerve block to disrupt pain signals being transmitted to the brain from the site of injury or surgery. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net product sales of iovera° were $8.8 million.

Our Strategy
We continue to advance our goal to be the global leader in delivering innovative non-opioid pain management and regenerative health solutions. To achieve this, we are advancing a three-pronged strategy: 
•Expanding the use of EXPAREL and iovera° for opioid-sparing pain management: As the only opioid-free, long-acting local and regional analgesic approved for infiltration, field blocks and interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, we believe EXPAREL is well-positioned to continue delivering strong sustainable growth from multiple sources. We are seeing increased use within the anesthesiology community through EXPAREL-based regional approaches that are enabling the shift of complex, painful procedures to the hospital outpatient and ambulatory settings. EXPAREL has become the foundation of opioid-sparing protocols for painful orthopedic procedures, including shoulder, hip fracture, joint reconstruction, and spine surgeries. We are expanding utilization through education and Phase 4 clinical evidence in key surgical settings, such as Cesarean section, or C-section, and other abdominal procedures. In addition, we are advancing clinical and regulatory activities to expand the EXPAREL label to include the pediatric and lower extremity nerve block settings. For iovera°, we are focusing on iovera° plus EXPAREL as a multimodal procedural solution for 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 8


total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, as well as drug-free, opioid-free, surgery-free pain management for osteoarthritis of the knee.
•Pursuing innovative acquisition targets that align with our strategy: We believe EXPAREL, iovera° and the DepoFoam platform offer a strong foundation to address the opioid epidemic. Building on these company assets, we are also pursuing innovative acquisition targets ranging from devices, therapeutics, cell therapies and regenerative medicines. Our goal is to build a portfolio of customer-focused non-opioid pain and regenerative health solutions to improve patients’ journeys along the neural pain pathway.
•Advancing a pipeline of new clinical candidates: We are developing a pipeline based on our DepoFoam platform, our established safe and effective multivesicular liposomal drug delivery technology. DepoFoam consists of microscopic, spherical, lipid-based particles composed of a honeycomb of numerous, non-concentric, internal aqueous chambers containing the encapsulated drug. DepoFoam provides flexible delivery and can be designed to offer an immediate release dose followed by sustained delivery. We are advancing a Phase 1 study to evaluate the epidural delivery of a DepoFoam-based local anesthetic as a potential alternative to the use of intrathecal opioids delivered by pumps and catheters and preclinical activities are underway for other DepoFoam-based clinical candidates targeting inflammation for chronic pain opportunities.
The Opioid Epidemic
Opioid addiction in the U.S. has reached epidemic proportions, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, reporting that more than 80,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the U.S. in the 12-months ending May 2020. This represents a worsening of the drug overdose epidemic in the U.S. and is the largest number of drug overdoses for a 12-month period ever recorded. The recent increase in drug overdose mortality began in 2019 and continued into 2020, prior to the declaration of the COVID-19 National Emergency in the U.S. in March. The increases in drug overdose deaths appear to have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Synthetic opioids are the primary driver of the increases in overdose deaths. The 12-month count of synthetic opioid overdose deaths increased 38% from the 12-months ended June 2019 compared with the 12-months ended May 2020. 
In 2018, new research showed that patients received nearly 100 to 200 opioid pills to help manage pain from four common procedures ranging from rotator cuff repair and hip replacement to knee replacement and sleeve gastrectomy. Further, one-quarter of orthopedic surgery patients were prescribed a daily dose of opioids equal to 90 milligrams of morphine or more, which are doses so potent that the CDC says they put patients at high risk for overdose. A 2017 report shows that across the seven orthopedic and soft tissue surgical procedures examined, patients were prescribed an average of 82 opioid pills each to help manage postsurgical pain. The research also indicates that close to 9% of surgical patients became newly persistent users in 2017, continuing to take these opioids at least three to six months after their procedure. Among patients having knee replacement surgery or a colectomy, newly persistent opioid users climbed as high as 15% and 17%, respectively. Further, women were 40% more likely to become persistent opioid users than men; and among persistent users, females were prescribed 15% more opioids than their male counterparts. These findings come from the report, United States for Non-Dependence: An Analysis of the Impact of Opioid Overprescribing in America, based on an analysis of 2016 adjudicated medical and pharmacy claims data conducted by QuintilesIMS.
EXPAREL
EXPAREL provides continuous and extended postsurgical analgesia and reduces the consumption of opioid medications. We believe EXPAREL simplifies postsurgical pain management, minimizes breakthrough episodes of pain and has the potential to result in improved patient care and outcomes, as well as enhanced hospital economics.
Our EXPAREL growth strategy is summarized as follows:
•Expanding the use of EXPAREL in key surgical settings: We are expanding the clinical evidence for EXPAREL through Phase 4 clinical trials across several surgical specialties. We have published positive results from a Phase 4 multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, or RCT, in TKA in the Journal of Arthroplasty. Positive findings from a multicenter RCT in C-section were presented at the most recent annual meeting of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP), and we recently reported positive topline results from a follow-on Phase 4 study in C-section procedures that compared an opioid-free EXPAREL arm to an opioid-based standard of care arm. EXPAREL is being incorporated into an increasing number of ERAS protocols from major academic centers for a wide range of procedures. In addition, we are advancing clinical and regulatory activities to support the future expansion of 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 9


EXPAREL to the pediatric and lower extremity nerve block settings. In November 2020, the European Commission, or EC, approved EXPAREL as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults. Additionally, regulatory initiatives are advancing in global markets such as Canada and China. 
•Expanding access to EXPAREL and driving education and awareness around the need for opioid-sparing strategies: New payer policies and benefits are supporting this migration to realize cost savings while enhancing patient care through the use of opioid-sparing protocols. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, is providing Medicare reimbursement for EXPAREL when administered in an Ambulatory Surgery Center, or ASC, through the product-specific Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code of C9290. Effective January 1, 2021, CMS added total hip arthroplasty to its listing of ASC covered procedures. The final CMS rule for 2021 also includes a scheduled phase-out of the inpatient-only list over the next three years. Under this plan, by 2024, no procedures will be mandated to be conducted in the in-patient setting. In addition, we continue to advance our Choices Matter national educational campaign, aimed at empowering patients to proactively discuss postsurgical pain management, including non-opioid options, with their healthcare providers.
•Partnering with those who share our commitment to innovative opioid-sparing procedural solutions: We have a growing network of strategic collaborations to expand education on the importance of non-opioid multimodal alternatives for post-surgical pain management and broaden our commercial reach. These include agreements with healthcare providers and hospital systems to support their implementation of opioid-sparing enhanced recovery protocols. We are collaborating on national and regional training initiatives with large anesthesia physician practices, such as MEDNAX, Inc. and Envision Physician Services. Our growing coalition of collaborators also includes Aetna, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, or AAOMS, the American College of Surgeons, the American Society for Enhanced Recovery, Cancer Treatment Centers of America, the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative, WellStar Health System, Shatterproof and IPG.
EXPAREL Clinical Benefits
We believe EXPAREL can replace the use of bupivacaine delivered via elastomeric pumps as the foundation of a multimodal regimen for long-acting postsurgical pain management. Based on our clinical data, EXPAREL:
•provides long-lasting local or regional analgesia;
•is a ready-to-use formulation;
•expands easily with saline or lactated Ringer’s solution to reach a desired volume;
•leverages existing interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, field block and infiltration administration techniques; and
•facilitates treatment of a variety of surgical sites.
We believe EXPAREL is a key component of long-acting postsurgical pain management regimens that reduce the need for opioids. Based on the clinical data from our Phase 3 and Phase 4 clinical studies as well as data from retrospective health outcomes studies, EXPAREL significantly reduces opioid usage while improving postsurgical pain management.
In our Phase 3 hemorrhoidectomy trial, EXPAREL:
•delayed the median time to rescue analgesic use (opioids) to 15 hours for patients treated with EXPAREL versus one hour for patients treated with placebo;
•significantly increased the percentage of patients requiring no opioid rescue medication through 72 hours post-surgery to 28%, compared to 10% for placebo;
•resulted in 45% less opioid usage through 72 hours post-surgery compared to placebo; and
•increased the percentage of patients who were pain free at 24 hours post-surgery compared to placebo.
In our Phase 3 trial as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block for upper extremity surgeries, EXPAREL:
•decreased total opioid consumption by 78% (p<0.0001) from zero to 48 hours after surgery;
•reduced pain scores by 46% versus placebo (p<0.0001); and
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 10


•allowed 13% of patients who received EXPAREL to remain opioid-free for 48 hours after surgery (p<0.01) compared to one opioid-free patient in the placebo arm.
EXPAREL can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes. We believe EXPAREL:
•provides effective pain control without the need for expensive and difficult-to-use delivery technologies that extend the duration of action for bupivacaine, such as elastomeric pumps, or opioids administered through patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, when used as part of a multimodal postsurgical pain regimen;
•reduces the need for patients to be constrained by elastomeric pumps and PCA systems, which are barriers to earlier ambulation and may introduce catheter-related issues, including infection; and
•promotes maintenance of early postsurgical pain management, which may reduce the time spent in the intensive care unit.
Key EXPAREL Markets
Orthopedics
EXPAREL is used across multiple orthopedic procedures, including joint reconstruction, shoulder, spine, extremities and hip fractures. EXPAREL-based ERAS protocols are becoming a cornerstone of opioid-sparing postsurgical pain management and enabling the shifting of many complex, painful orthopedic procedures to the 23-hour stay environment.
EXPAREL is being adopted in an increasing number of spine surgeries as a key component of a multimodal pain management solution enabling rapid recovery after surgery and a shift to the outpatient site of care. Common applications include infiltration, erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks and TAP blocks.
EXPAREL administered as a brachial plexus nerve block is a key and growing part of our business. An EXPAREL brachial plexus block provides pain coverage for the upper quadrant for use in rotator cuff, shoulder arthroplasty, elbow, wrist and hand procedures. Our anesthesiologist customers see the strong advantages of using brachial plexus and other field blocks as a vehicle for shifting procedures to the ASC setting by replacing antiquated pumps and catheters, which often become dislodged and prevent a procedure from taking place in a 23-hour site of care. Additionally, the ASC environment is an area where EXPAREL reimbursement is consistently improving as payers and self-insured employers continue to drive the shift from inpatient to outpatient care for a variety of surgeries.
Abdominal and Colorectal
After having success with the brachial plexus block, anesthesiologists typically seek to broaden their EXPAREL use with other field blocks. TAP blocks are a significant market where EXPAREL is providing long-acting pain control in the abdominal region and supporting the migration of these procedures to the ASC setting. We expect the expanding use of EXPAREL in the estimated six million abdominal and colorectal procedures that occur annually in the U.S. to be a significant growth driver.
Women’s Health
There is a significant and growing demand among women for managing pain with non-opioid options. Opioid addiction in women is growing at an alarming rate and studies have shown that women are 40% more likely than men to become newly persistent users of opioids following surgery. Women’s Health continues to be an important source of growth as anesthesia-driven EXPAREL-based TAP and Pectoralis, or PEC, blocks take hold as institutional protocol for C-section, abdominoplasty, gynecologic oncology, mastectomy and breast reconstruction procedures.
Cardiothoracic 
Cardiothoracic surgery is considered one of the most painful types of surgical procedures for both open and minimally invasive procedures. As a result, opioids are widely used, but are often inadequate. Poorly controlled postoperative pain leads to the development of chronic persistent pain in as many as 40% of these patients and persistent opioid use after surgery is seen in over 10% of such patients. Regional anesthesia approaches have been evolving, with EXPAREL replacing thoracic epidurals as an alternative method of producing long-lasting analgesia.

EXPAREL Dosing, Volume Expansion and Admixing with Bupivacaine HCl
EXPAREL is available as a 266 mg/20 mL single-use vial and a 133 mg/10 mL single-use vial. The recommended dose of EXPAREL is based on (i) the size of the surgical site; (ii) the volume needed to cover the width and depth of the surgical site and (iii) patient-specific factors that could impact safety of an amide-type local anesthetic. The maximum dose should not exceed 266 mg.
EXPAREL can be expanded in volume to optimize results. Physicians consider the size of the surgical site and neuroanatomy to determine dosing and volume expansion. The 266 mg (20 mL) EXPAREL vial can be expanded with up to 280 mL of normal (0.9%) saline or lactated Ringer’s solution for a total volume of 300 mL (a 1:14 ratio). For smaller surgical sites where 20 mL is too much volume, the 133 mg (10 mL) vial should be considered.
To ensure early analgesic activity, EXPAREL can be admixed with bupivacaine HCl so long as the ratio does not exceed 1:2. For example, the 266 mg/20mL vial may be administered with up to 30 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine HCl or up to 60 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine HCl. Bupivacaine HCl may be administered immediately before EXPAREL or admixed in the same syringe.
EXPAREL Health Economic Benefits
In addition to being efficacious and safe, we believe that EXPAREL provides health economic benefits that play an important role in formulary decision-making that are often overlooked. Several members of our management team have extensive experience applying health economic outcomes research to support commercial success. Our strategy is to work directly with the senior leadership of our hospital and ASC customers, integrated health networks, quality improvement organizations, key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in the field of postsurgical pain management and leading influencer hospitals to provide them with retrospective and prospective studies to demonstrate the economic benefits of EXPAREL.
Third Molar (Wisdom Tooth) Procedures
In September 2017, we announced a collaboration with Aetna, one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits companies, with the support of AAOMS. This national program aims to reduce the number of opioid tablets dispensed to patients undergoing impacted third molar (wisdom tooth) extractions by at least 50% through the utilization of EXPAREL to provide prolonged non-opioid postsurgical pain control. Aetna now includes the cost of EXPAREL as a covered expense for impacted third molar extractions performed by surgeons who have completed training on use of the product.
According to a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) study, more than two-thirds of patients who underwent surgical tooth extractions reported unused prescription opioids, with the majority also indicating that these medications are neither safely stored nor disposed of. These facts suggest that there is a dangerous accumulation of opioids in the home, which are available for potential diversion or misuse.
EXPAREL Label Expansion
Pediatrics
In December 2019, we reported positive topline results from our Phase 3 registration study (known as “PLAY”) of EXPAREL administered as a single-dose infiltration in pediatric patients undergoing spinal or cardiac surgeries. Overall findings were consistent with the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles for adult patients with no safety concerns identified at a dose of 4 mg/kg. Based on the positive data from the PLAY study, we submitted an sNDA to the FDA seeking expansion of the EXPAREL label to include single-dose infiltration to provide postsurgical analgesia in children aged six and over. In August 2020, the FDA accepted our sNDA and provided a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of March 22, 2021.
The PLAY study enrolled 98 patients to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of EXPAREL for two patient groups: patients aged 12 to less than 17 years and patients aged 6 to less than 12 years. In agreement with the FDA, the primary and secondary objectives of the PLAY study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of EXPAREL, respectively. The EMA has agreed that the PLAY study will meet our pediatric requirement in the E.U. for patients aged 6 to 17. The full study results will be submitted for publication in the peer-reviewed medical literature.
 We are working with the FDA to identify an appropriate clinical program for EXPAREL administered as a nerve block in the pediatric setting and have an agreed upon Pediatric Investigation Plan with the EMA for EXPAREL in the E.U. We are in 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 12


negotiations with the FDA and the EMA for clarity on other pediatric study obligations.and are working with both agencies to synchronize our pediatric clinical studies as much as possible between the two regions.
Nerve Block in Lower Extremity Surgery
We have initiated a Phase 3 study for nerve block in lower extremity surgeries (known as “STRIDE”) that is comparing an EXPAREL nerve block in lower extremity surgeries to a bupivacaine lower extremity nerve block in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgeries. We believe positive results from this study will support an sNDA submission seeking label expansion to include lower extremity nerve blocks. A filing strategy was agreed to with the FDA and we intend to file a variation with the EMA. We believe the addition of this indication is significant as anesthesia-driven regional approaches using nerve and field blocks continue to expand as institutional protocols.
Global Expansion
We have defined a global expansion strategy for EXPAREL that we believe provides us with the opportunity to increase our revenue and leverage our fixed cost infrastructure. We have prioritized Europe, Canada and China. In Europe, we were granted marketing authorization by the EC in November 2020 for EXPAREL as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operating pain in adults and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults. We are planning to launch EXPAREL together with iovera° in targeted European countries beginning in the second half of 2021.
The EC approval was based on the results of four pivotal Phase 3 studies that demonstrated improvements in pain reduction and opioid use. These studies include:
•Lower Extremity Nerve Block Study: This study assessed the safety and efficacy of EXPAREL as a femoral nerve block in patients undergoing TKA. Results demonstrated that EXPAREL resulted in a significant reduction in cumulative pain scores over 72 hours compared to placebo. A higher percentage of patients who received EXPAREL were pain-free, consumed fewer opioids and reported higher satisfaction with their pain control compared with placebo.
•Upper Extremity Nerve Block Study: This study assessed the safety and efficacy of EXPAREL as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair. Results demonstrated that EXPAREL significantly improved pain control and reduced opioid consumption through 48 hours compared with placebo and a standardized pain management protocol alone.
•Hard Tissue Surgery Infiltration Study: This study assessed the safety and efficacy of EXPAREL administered via infiltration in patients undergoing bunionectomy. Results demonstrated that EXPAREL significantly reduced pain and opioid consumption compared with placebo over the first 24 hours following surgery than patients administered placebo.
•Soft Tissue Surgery Infiltration Study: This study assessed the safety and efficacy of EXPAREL administered via infiltration in patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy. Results demonstrated that EXPAREL significantly reduced pain compared to placebo at all time points, including a 30% reduction in the cumulative pain scores at 72 hours. Patients who received EXPAREL consumed significantly fewer opioids than patients administered placebo.
The EC decision is applicable to all 27 E.U. member states plus the United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Despite the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the E.U. (“Brexit”), this approval will still be recognized by the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, however we will need to transfer the EMA marketing authorization.
In Canada, Health Canada has validated our New Drug Submission and we remain in labeling discussions. We do not intend to pursue a commercial partnership to commercialize EXPAREL in either Europe or Canada.
In China, we have an agreement with Nuance Biotech Co. Ltd., or Nuance, a China-based specialty pharmaceutical company, for the development and commercialization of EXPAREL. We have completed a pharmacokinetic study requested by the National Medical Products Administration in China and we are planning to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application in support of such a study.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 13


iovera°
The iovera° system is highly complementary to EXPAREL as a non-opioid therapy that produces cryoanalgesia via a handheld device by disrupting pain signals transmitted to the brain from the site of injury or surgery and alleviates pain. The iovera° system is 510(k) cleared in the U.S., has a CE mark in the E.U. and is cleared for marketing in Canada for the blocking of pain. It is also indicated for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with arthritis of the knee for up to 90 days.
Our commercial strategy for iovera° focuses on two broad market segments. First, iovera° and EXPAREL for opioid-sparing pain management for the TKA patient, with iovera° being administered before surgery and EXPAREL administered during surgery. We are enrolling patients into our PREPARE study that will evaluate iovera° and EXPAREL for TKA. As many as 30% of presurgical patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis use prescription opioids. With iovera°, our goal is to provide patients with several months of non-opioid pain control to allow them to prepare for surgery with an appropriate regimen. We also believe that EXPAREL plus iovera° for postsurgical pain control could support rapid functional recovery.
The second target market is iovera° for osteoarthritis patients who have failed conservative treatments, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or viscosupplementation, and are seeking drug-free, opioid-free, surgery-free pain management for several months. We are targeting patients who are seeking an active lifestyle, as well as patients who desire to delay surgery for personal or medical reasons.
Osteoarthritis of the Knee
There is a growing body of clinical data demonstrating success with the iovera° treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. There are 14 million individuals in the U.S. who have symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, and nearly two million are under the age of 45. Surgical intervention is typically a last resort for patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. In one study, the majority of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee experienced pain relief up to 150 days after being treated with iovera°.
Preliminary findings demonstrated reductions in opioids, including:
•The daily morphine equivalent consumption in the per protocol group analysis was significantly lower at 72 hours (p<0.05), 6 weeks (p<0.05) and 12 weeks (p<0.05).
•Patients who were administered iovera° were far less likely to take opioids six weeks after surgery. The number of patients taking opioids six weeks after TKA in the control group was three times the number of patients taking opioids in the cryoanalgesia group (14% vs. 44%, p<0.01).
•Patients in the iovera° group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain scores from their baseline pain scores at 72 hours (p<0.05) and at 12 weeks (p<0.05).
We believe these data validate iovera° as a clinically meaningful non-opioid alternative for patients undergoing TKA, and that iovera° offers the opportunity to provide patients with non-opioid pain control well in advance of any necessary surgical intervention through a number of key product attributes:
•iovera° is safe and effective with immediate pain relief that can last for months as the nerve regenerates over time;
•iovera° is repeatable;
•The iovera° technology does not risk damage to the surrounding tissue;
•iovera° is a convenient handheld device with a single-use procedure-specific smart tip; and
•iovera° can be delivered precisely using ultrasound guidance or an anatomical landmark.
We believe the combination of iovera° and EXPAREL will become the preferred procedural solution that will empower patients and their healthcare providers to take control of the patients’ osteoarthritis journey, while minimizing the need for opioids. We will be investing in key clinical studies to demonstrate the synergy of iovera° and EXPAREL to manage pain while reducing or eliminating opioids.
Product Pipeline
Given the proven safety, flexibility and customizability of our DepoFoam platform for acute, sub-acute and chronic pain applications, we have several DepoFoam-based products in preclinical development. Following data readouts from preclinical and feasibility studies for these candidates, we have prioritized two programs for clinical development: (i) a DepoFoam-based 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 14


analgesic for acute and chronic pain using epidural delivery and (ii) other DepoFoam-based clinical candidates targeting inflammation for chronic pain opportunities.
We plan to invest in clinical initiatives to broaden the scope of iovera° applications and improve its functionality for current and future end users. This will be accomplished through enhancements across the product line, which is comprised of single-use disposable units as well as non-disposable handheld devices.
In parallel, our business development team continues to pursue innovative acquisition targets that are complementary to EXPAREL and iovera° and are of great interest to the surgical and anesthesia audiences we are already calling on today. We believe our leadership position in opioid-sparing pain control provides us with a significant opportunity to build a differentiated portfolio to improve the patient journey along the neural pain pathway.
Sales and Marketing
We have built our sales and marketing organization to commercialize our products. Our primary target audiences are healthcare practitioners who influence pain management decisions including anesthesiologists, surgeons, pharmacists and registered nurses.
Our field team, consisting of sales representatives, account managers, scientific and medical affairs personnel and reimbursement and market access professionals, executes on a full range of activities to broaden the use of our non-opioid products for pain management, including:
•providing publications and abstracts showing clinical efficacy and safety, health outcomes and review articles;
•working in tandem with hospital staff, such as anesthesiologists, surgeons, heads of quality, pharmacists, executives and registered nurses, to provide access and resources for drug utilization or medication use evaluations and health outcomes studies, which provide retrospective and prospective analyses for our hospital customers using their own hospital data to demonstrate the true cost of opioid-based postsurgical pain control;

Pacira Innovation and Training Center of Tampa
In October 2020, we announced the grand opening of the Pacira Innovation and Training center of Tampa (the “PITT”). We designed this facility to help advance clinician understanding of the latest local, regional and field block approaches for managing pain. The PITT provides an unparalleled training environment for healthcare providers working to reduce or eliminate patient exposure to opioids.
The PITT is a fully adaptable environment and is equipped with state-of-the-art technology and audio/visual capabilities to support a full range of educational events, such as presentations and hands-on workshops.
The PITT features several distinct training spaces including a simulation lab equipped with seven ultrasound scanning stations; a lecture hall featuring a 4½-foot-tall by 24-foot-wide liquid crystal display video wall to support live, virtual and even global presentations; and a green-screen broadcast studio designed to livestream content with single or multiple hosts.
In addition to the EXPAREL programs, we are hosting ongoing workshops to train new users on best practice techniques for iovera° administration at the PITT. Led by healthcare professionals, these labs include didactic lectures and hands-on trainings including live model nerve scanning and identification using ultrasound and peripheral nerve stimulation.

The PITT also serves as a venue for national anesthesia provider organizations to host their own workshops and training sessions.
DePuy Synthes Sales Inc.
In July 2020, we announced the conclusion of a co-promotion agreement with DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc., or DePuy Synthes, part of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies to market and promote the use of EXPAREL for orthopedic procedures in the U.S. market. The collaboration began in January 2017 and concluded in January 2021. During that time DePuy Synthes field representatives collaborated with the Pacira field teams to support EXPAREL use and education in orthopedic surgical settings. In addition to partnering with DePuy Synthes in support of orthopedic surgical procedures, Pacira field representatives remained the overall EXPAREL account managers and commercial leads for soft tissue surgeons, anesthesiologists and ASCs. Through this collaboration we significantly expanded the use of EXPAREL and solidified its role in opioid-sparing protocols across a range of orthopedic procedures. Our decision to conclude the partnership was due to the evolution of orthopedic practice from an inpatient hospital experience to the ambulatory setting with anesthesia-driven regional approaches playing an increasingly essential role. This growing market is already served by our field-based teams.
Other Agreements
MyoScience Acquisition
In April 2019, we completed the MyoScience Acquisition. The consideration included an initial cash payment of $120.0 million, reduced by $1.0 million for post-closing purchase price adjustments and indemnification obligations incurred to date, plus contingent milestone payments up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of which $58.0 million is available at December 31, 2020. Upon the completion of the MyoScience Acquisition, we renamed MyoScience Pacira CryoTech, Inc. For more information on the MyoScience Acquisition, refer to Note 5, MyoScience Acquisition, to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
TELA Bio, Inc.
In October 2017, we made an investment of $15.0 million in TELA Bio, Inc., or TELA Bio, a surgical reconstruction company that markets its proprietary OviTexTM portfolio of products for ventral hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction. OviTex Reinforced BioScaffolds (RBSs) are intended for use as a surgical mesh to reinforce and/or repair soft tissue where weakness exists. In 2019, we made an additional investment of $1.6 million in TELA Bio. For more information, refer to Note 12, Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
GeneQuine Biotherapeutics GmbH
In December 2020, we made an equity investment in GeneQuine Biotherapeutics GmbH, or GeneQuine, a privately held biopharmaceutical company advancing a gene therapy platform for the treatment of osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders. GeneQuine’s product candidates are next-generation gene transfer vehicles. These gene therapy vectors are highly efficient in entering joint cells to confer multi-year gene expression. Safety of this platform has been demonstrated in several species and is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 study. GeneQuine’s lead gene therapy product candidate, GQ-303 and its analogs are currently in preclinical development as a treatment for osteoarthritis. These helper-dependent adenoviral gene therapy vectors express proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a protein that plays an important physiological role in regulating osteoarthritis through lubrication and decreased pain, inflammation and cartilage degeneration. After intra-articular injection, the vector enters joint cells and turns them into factories to produce sustained therapeutic levels of PRG4 to restore joint homeostasis and provide long-lasting improvement in joint function and pain relief, which has been demonstrated in several in vivo osteoarthritis models.
Under the terms of the agreement, we made an initial investment of $1.2 million and subsequently invested $1.2 million in the form of a convertible note in January 2021. We will make an additional $4.9 million investment predicated upon GeneQuine achieving certain prespecified near-term milestones related to GQ-303. Up to $3.0 million of our investment will be in the form of a convertible note. For more information, refer to Note 12, Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included herein.

SkyePharma Holdings, Inc. (Now a Subsidiary of Vectura Group plc)
In connection with the stock purchase agreement related to the Skyepharma Acquisition, we agreed to certain earn-out and milestone payments. Milestone payments are based on net sales of DepoBupivacaine products collected, including EXPAREL, and certain other yet-to-be-developed products. For purposes of meeting future potential milestone payments, annual net sales are measured on a rolling quarterly basis. The milestones are as follows:
•$10.0 million upon the first commercial sale in the U.S. (met April 2012);
•$4.0 million upon the first commercial sale in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy or Spain; 
•$8.0 million when annual net sales collected reach $100.0 million (met September 2014);
•$8.0 million when annual net sales collected reach $250.0 million (met June 2016); and
•$32.0 million when annual net sales collected reach $500.0 million.
 The earn-out payments were based on a percentage of net sales of DepoBupivacaine products collected, including EXPAREL, for the term during which such sales were covered by a valid claim in certain patent rights. The last patents during which a valid claim existed expired on September 18, 2018, and thus, the only potential remaining obligations to Skyepharma are the two unmet milestone payments totaling $36.0 million. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further information related to the Skyepharma Acquisition.

Pursuant to an agreement with the Research Development Foundation, or RDF, we are required to pay RDF a low single-digit royalty on the collection of revenues from our DepoFoam-based products for as long as certain patents assigned to us under the agreement remain valid. RDF has the right to terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by us, in connection with our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we directly or indirectly oppose or dispute the validity of the assigned patent rights.
Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.
In December 2012, we entered into an Exclusive License, Development and Commercialization Agreement and related Supply Agreement with Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Elanco Animal Health, Inc., or Aratana. Under the agreements, we granted Aratana an exclusive royalty-bearing license, including the limited right to grant sublicenses, for the development and commercialization of our bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product for use in animals. In August 2016, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, approved NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), as a local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs (NOCITA is a registered trademark of Aratana). In August 2018, the CVM expanded the NOCITA label to include its use as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional postoperative analgesia following onychectomy in cats. In June 2019, the CVM approved a 10mL vial size for NOCITA. Aratana began purchasing our bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product in 2016.
We are eligible to receive up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of commercial milestones. Aratana is required to pay us a tiered double-digit royalty on certain net sales made in the U.S. If the product is approved by foreign regulatory agencies for sale outside of the U.S., Aratana will be required to pay us a tiered double-digit royalty on such net sales. Royalty rates will be reduced by a certain percentage upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications into certain jurisdictions or if Aratana must pay royalties to third parties under certain circumstances.
Either party has the right to terminate the license agreement in connection with (i) an insolvency event involving the other party that is not discharged in a specified period of time; (ii) a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a specified cure period or (iii) the failure to achieve a minimum annual revenue as set forth in the agreement, all on specified notice. We may terminate the agreement in connection with (i) Aratana’s failure to pay any amounts due under the agreement; (ii) Aratana’s failure to achieve regulatory approval in a particular jurisdiction with respect to such jurisdiction or (iii) Aratana’s failure to achieve its first commercial sale within a certain amount of time on a country by country basis after receiving regulatory approval, all on specified notice. Aratana may terminate the license agreement (i) upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications on a country by country basis or (ii) at any time on a country by country basis except with respect to the U.S. and any country in the E.U., all on specified notice. The parties may also terminate the license agreement by mutual consent. The license agreement will terminate automatically if we terminate the supply agreement. In the event that the license agreement is terminated, all rights to the product (on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis) will be terminated and returned to us. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the license agreement is effective until July 2033, after which Aratana has the option to extend the agreement for an additional five-year term, subject to certain requirements.

Nuance Biotech Co. Ltd.
In June 2018, we entered into an agreement with Nuance, a China-based specialty pharmaceutical company, to advance the development and commercialization of EXPAREL in China. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to be the sole supplier of EXPAREL to Nuance and granted Nuance the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize EXPAREL in China. We received an upfront payment of $3.0 million in July 2018 and are eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $60.0 million that are triggered by filing for and securing regulatory approval(s) and annual sales in China exceeding certain thresholds. We are also entitled to tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales.
DepoCyt(e)
DepoCyt(e) was a sustained-release liposomal formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine that utilized our DepoFoam technology and was indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, a life-threatening complication of lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. In June 2017, we discontinued production of DepoCyt® (U.S. and Canada) and DepoCyte® (E.U.) due to persistent technical issues specific to the DepoCyt(e) manufacturing process.
Significant Customers
We had three wholesalers each comprising 10% or more of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020: Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Drug Company and AmerisourceBergen Health Corporation, which accounted for 31%, 31% and 25% of our total revenues, respectively. These wholesalers process orders for EXPAREL under a drop-ship program. EXPAREL is delivered directly to end-users without the wholesalers ever taking physical possession of the product.
Manufacturing and Research Facilities
Internal Facilities
We manufacture EXPAREL at our facility in San Diego, California. We also have a mixed-use research and development, manufacturing and office facility which sits adjacent to our EXPAREL manufacturing facility, and a warehouse located within five miles of these facilities. We refer to these three buildings as the Science Center Campus, and together they consist of approximately 195,000 square feet. Our manufacturing facilities are inspected regularly and approved by the FDA, EMA, MHRA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our iovera° facility in Fremont, California, consists of approximately 20,000 square feet of mixed-use manufacturing, research and development and office space.
We purchase raw materials and components from third-party suppliers to manufacture EXPAREL and iovera°. In most instances, alternative sources of supply are available, although switching to an alternative source would, in some instances, take time and could lead to delays in manufacturing our product candidates. While we have not experienced shortages of our raw materials in the past, such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to us at the times that we need them or on commercially reasonable terms and we do not have direct control over the availability of these raw materials from our suppliers.
All manufacturing of products, initial product release and stability testing are conducted by us in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or CGMP.
Our EXPAREL manufacturing facility at the Science Center Campus is an approximately 84,000 square foot structure located on a five-acre site. It was custom built as a pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing facility in 1995. Activities in this facility include the manufacture of EXPAREL bulk product on dedicated production lines and its fill/finish into vials, microbiological and quality control testing, product storage, development of analytical methods and manufacturing of development products. We are expanding our EXPAREL manufacturing capacity directly and through agreements with a third-party, Thermo Fisher, as demand for EXPAREL increases, as explained below.
Our 90,000 square-foot mixed-use research and development, manufacturing and office facility was built in 1990 and is located adjacent to our EXPAREL manufacturing facility. This building houses our Science Center related research and development activities and general and administrative functions, as it includes both laboratories and the building infrastructure necessary to support the formulation, analytical testing, clinical and process development activities for manufacturing additional commercial product indications and new pipeline products. Our pilot plant suite for early-stage clinical product production is located in this building and there is additional space for future expansion opportunities.
We also have an approximately 21,000 square foot warehouse built in 1988 that serves as the main CGMP warehouse for our San Diego operations, primarily being used for the storage of production materials. It contains ambient as well as cold temperature CGMP warehouse storage and also features a quality control clean room for sampling incoming materials.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 18


Our Fremont, California facility was built in 1998 and has been leased since 2015. It is dedicated to the iovera° product line and consists of approximately 20,000 square feet of space for manufacturing, quality control, research and development and the warehousing of raw materials and finished goods. We have expanded our iovera° manufacturing capacity through a third party, Providien Device Assembly, LLC, or Providien, as explained below.
Distribution of our DepoFoam products, including EXPAREL, requires cold-chain distribution, whereby a product must be maintained between specified temperatures. We have validated processes for continuous monitoring of temperature from manufacturing through delivery to the end-user.
Co-Production Facilities
Thermo Fisher Scientific Pharma Services
 In April 2014, we and Thermo Fisher entered into a Strategic Co-Production Agreement, Technical Transfer and Service Agreement and Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “Thermo Fisher Agreements”) to collaborate in the manufacture of EXPAREL. Thermo Fisher undertook certain technical transfer activities and construction services needed to prepare Thermo Fisher’s Swindon, England facility for the manufacture of EXPAREL in two dedicated manufacturing suites. We provided Thermo Fisher with the equipment necessary to manufacture EXPAREL and pay fees to Thermo Fisher based on Thermo Fisher’s achievement of certain technical transfer and construction milestones. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for certain nominal expenses and additional services. In February 2019, we announced that commercial production of EXPAREL is underway at the first Thermo Fisher suite, and that we are developing a second dedicated suite that is expected to enable another doubling of EXPAREL manufacturing capacity and should be available to begin commercial production in approximately one year from now.
The initial term of the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement is 10 years from the date of FDA approval of the first manufacturing suite, which was received in May 2018. We pay fees to Thermo Fisher for their operation of the manufacturing suites and the amount of EXPAREL produced by Thermo Fisher. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for purchases made on our behalf, certain nominal expenses and additional services. We may terminate this agreement upon one month’s notice if a regulatory authority causes the withdrawal of EXPAREL from the U.S. or any other market that represents 80% of our overall sales, or at any time for convenience by providing between 18 and 36 months’ notice (depending on the number of years after the FDA approval date). Either party may terminate the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement in the event of the breach or bankruptcy of the other party.
Providien Device Assembly
In January 2020, we and Providien entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “Providien Agreement”) to collaborate in the manufacture of iovera° tips at Providien’s Tijuana, Mexico facility. The initial term of the Providien Agreement is five years. We will pay fees based on the amount of iovera° tips delivered by Providien. The Providien Agreement may be terminated by either party upon one years’ written notice without cause. We may terminate the Providien Agreement upon thirty days’ written notice in the event that iovera° is withdrawn from the market or no longer sold by us. Either party may terminate the Providien Agreement in the event of the breach or bankruptcy of the other party.
Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
We seek to protect our products, our product candidates and our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, regulatory exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. We note that the patents and applications described below are only examples intended to highlight the variety of coverage provided by our existing and constantly developing portfolio.
Patents and Patent Applications
We seek to protect the proprietary position of our products and product candidates by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of December 31, 2020, there are over seven families of patents and patent applications relating to various aspects of the DepoFoam delivery technology and 25 families of patents and patent applications relating to various aspects of the technology used by iovera°. Patents have been issued in numerous countries, with an emphasis on the North American, European and Japanese markets. These patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of the non-provisional filing unless referring to an earlier filed application. Some of our expired U.S. patents had a term of 17 years from the grant date. Our issued patents expire at various dates in the future, as discussed below, with the last currently issued patent 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 19


for the DepoFoam delivery technology expiring in 2037 and the last currently issued patent for the iovera° technology expiring in 2040.
Patents and Patent Applications for DepoFoam and DepoFoam Products
A patent relating to product-by-process and process in connection with the production of multivesicular liposomes was issued on March 7, 2017. This patent is listed in the Orange Book for EXPAREL and includes a patent term adjustment that equates to an expiration date of December 24, 2021. Additionally, we have filed several pending patent applications directed to other important aspects of the EXPAREL technology which, if granted, would provide additional patent protection through 2040 and beyond.
Issued patents for EXPAREL in the U.S. relating to methods for modifying the rate of drug release of the product candidate and the composition of the product candidate expired in January 2017 and September 2018, respectively. In the U.S., a patent relating to the composition of the product was issued in September 2014 and expired in September 2018. A patent relating to the method of treatment using EXPAREL was issued in December 2015 and expired in September 2018. In Europe, granted patent(s) related to the composition of EXPAREL expired in September 2018. A patent relating to methods of modifying the rate of drug release of the product candidate expired in January 2018. In addition, a patent relating to the process for making the product candidate expired in November 2018.
In April 2010, a provisional patent was filed relating to a new process to manufacture EXPAREL and other DepoFoam-based products. The process offers many advantages to the current process, including larger scale production and lower manufacturing costs. In April 2011, we filed an international patent application providing the basis for several national phase patent applications, for example in Europe, China, Japan, Israel and India which, if granted, could potentially prevent others from using this process until at least 2031. In the U.S., we also filed a series of patent applications directed to the new manufacturing process. Eight of the patent applications were issued as patents as of December 2020. Patents that claim the process and apparatus will expire at the latest in November 2033. One of the patents claims a product made by the process and expires in April 2031. As of December 31, 2020, we have four granted patents in China, one granted patent in Europe, one granted patent in Japan and one granted patent in Israel, protecting various aspects of the new process, including the methods of using the apparatus and the apparatus itself.
Patents and Patent Applications for iovera°
Issued patents in the U.S. afford us a wide range of coverage of various aspects of the iovera° technology. For example, several of our earliest filed patents cover the structural aspects of a handheld cryogenic device with single needle and needle arrays, tissue-penetrating needle probes that may be detachable, fused silica tubing fluid delivery paths, methods of applying cryotherapy using the cryogenic device and methods for using replaceable needle probes. These patents are set to expire between 2025 and 2032. An important patent family specifically directed to systems and methods of treating pain offers both broad and variable coverage of cryogenic device features and methods of using the same for pain management, including single-use needle probes, particular needle sizes and shapes. Patents in this family are set to expire between 2025 and 2028. Another important patent family has broad disclosure and coverage of a variety of indications for treatment by cryogenic devices, including joint function and stiffness, osteoarthritis, occipital neuralgia, spasticity, neuroma and other nerve entrapment indications and is set to expire between 2033 and 2037.
Additionally, there are several patents and pending patent applications directed to other important aspects of the iovera° technology. For example, patents covering needle cladding and the probe filtration system are set to expire in 2033 and patents on the smart tip technology are set to expire between 2034 and 2037. Other patents and applications cover methods of using needles with blunt tips and aspects of cryogenic devices coupled with a neurostimulator for locating nerves. We also have three design patent families that cover the current handheld cryogenic device, its charging station dock and combinations thereof. To obtain coverage of our developing next-generation technology, we filed eight new non-provisional and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications in 2020, which if granted, could potentially prevent others from using this next-generation technology until at least 2040.
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
Trade secrets play an important role in protecting our DepoFoam-based and iovera° products and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. The scale-up and commercial manufacture of DepoFoam-based and iovera° products involve processes, custom equipment and in-process and release analytical techniques that we believe are unique to us. The expertise and knowledge required to understand the critical aspects of DepoFoam manufacturing steps requires knowledge of both traditional and non-traditional emulsion processing and traditional pharmaceutical production, overlaid with all of the 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 20


challenges presented by aseptic manufacturing. The iovera° system relies on manufacturing techniques that are able to provide the precision and tight tolerances required for a self-contained handheld cryogenic device. Additionally, our device includes proprietary software for device operations during cryotherapy treatments.
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Competition
EXPAREL
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than EXPAREL or any other products that we are currently selling through partners or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
EXPAREL competes with well-established products with similar indications. Competing products available for postsurgical pain management include opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, each of which is available generically from several manufacturers, and several of which are available as proprietary products using novel delivery systems. Ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, is also available generically in the U.S. from several manufacturers, and Caldolor (ibuprofen for injection), an NSAID, has been approved by the FDA for pain management and fever in adults. EXPAREL also competes with currently-marketed non-opioid products such as bupivacaine, marcaine, ropivacaine and other anesthetics/analgesics, all of which are also used in the treatment of postsurgical pain and are available as either oral tablets, injectable dosage forms or administered using novel delivery systems. Additional products may be developed for the treatment of acute pain, including new injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of currently available opioids and NSAIDs, long-acting local anesthetics and new chemical entities as well as alternative delivery forms of various opioids and NSAIDs. Currently EXPAREL also competes with elastomeric pumps/catheter devices intended to provide bupivacaine over several days. Avanos Medical, Inc. markets these medical devices in the U.S.
iovera°
The medical device industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The cryotherapy pain management field in particular is a growing industry due to increased attention on opioid usage for pain, which has created a rapidly emerging market and has fueled an increased interest in opioid alternatives. Many of our competitors in our space have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products. The rise of various small and early-stage companies in the cryotherapy pain management field may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors are continuously engaged in trials and attempts to develop new products or approaches in hopes of capturing the pain management market. They may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 21


technologies that are more effective or less costly than the iovera° system, which could render the iovera° system obsolete and noncompetitive. As a result, it is critical that we continue to innovate and to increase marketing efforts in our primary markets. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
Besides pharmaceutical products for pain management, iovera° competes with medical devices that ablate or degenerate peripheral nerves to treat indications such as joint pain, neuralgia and osteoarthritis pain. Competing products include cryotherapy devices as well as other devices such as cooled radio-frequency ablation devices that block or degenerate peripheral nerves involved in conducting pain signals. Avanos Medical, Inc. markets these medical devices in the U.S. Additional non-opioid products or entirely different approaches may also be developed for pain management by one or more of our competitors.
Government Regulation 
In the U.S., prescription drug and medical device products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, safety, efficacy, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Outside the U.S., prescription drug and medical device products are regulated by comparable agencies (including the EMA and MHRA), laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, debarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
United States Regulatory Environment
Pharmaceuticals
Generally, the FDA must approve any new drug, including a new use of a previously approved drug, before marketing of the drug occurs in the U.S. This process generally involves:
•completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations (21 CFR 58);
•submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin for unapproved use in the U.S.;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•completion of process validation, quality product release and stability;
•submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the product’s manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with CGMP requirements and to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
•review and approval by the FDA of the NDA.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that the FDA will grant approvals for any of our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the trial on a clinical hold because of, among other things, concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial or about exposure of human research subjects to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Thus, submission of an 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 22


IND does not by itself automatically result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. In addition, the FDA requires us to amend an existing IND for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an IRB covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial along with informed consent information for subjects before the clinical trial commences at that center. The IRB also must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time, on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive climate.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-maintained website (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and report key findings and parameters. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, typically, the conduct of human clinical trials occurs in the following three pre-market sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: Sponsors initially conduct clinical trials in a limited population, either patients or healthy volunteers, to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the cases of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing often is conducted only on patients having the specific disease. 
•Phase 2: Sponsors conduct clinical trials generally in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Sponsors may conduct multiple Phase 2 clinical trials to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: These include expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials, including pivotal clinical trials. When Phase 2 evaluations suggest the effectiveness of a dose range of the product and acceptability of such product’s safety profile, sponsors undertake Phase 3 clinical trials in larger patient populations to obtain additional information needed to evaluate the overall benefit and risk balance of the drug and to provide an adequate basis to develop labeling.
Some clinical trials may be overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is likely to take a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If an application is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will review and approve the NDA. In addition, sponsors may elect to conduct, or be required by the FDA to, conduct post-approval clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after NDA approval, generate new data and best-practice administration techniques. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Medical Devices
In the U.S., the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FDCA and its subsequent amendments regulate the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Medical devices that require notification submitted as a 510(k) clearance request must be reviewed and cleared by the FDA before we can begin marketing them. To request 510(k) clearance, we must be able to demonstrate that the medical device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared and legally marketed 510(k) medical device. Medical devices require extensive clinical testing which consists of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval, or PMA, applications for specific surgical indications. The FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Pharmaceuticals
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, sponsors submit the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 23


to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In addition, 505(b)(2) applications must contain a patent certification for each patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book that covers the drug referenced in the application and upon which the third-party studies were conducted. For some drugs, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe the drug or where it may be dispensed or administered. Upon receipt of an NDA, the FDA has 60 days to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to initiate a substantive review. If the FDA identifies deficiencies that would preclude substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the NDA (“refuse to file”) and will inform the sponsor of the deficiencies that must be corrected prior to resubmission. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. If the FDA accepts the submission for substantive review, the FDA typically reviews the NDA in accordance with established timeframes. Under PDUFA, the FDA establishes goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system: Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that address an unmet medical need by offering major advances in treatment or providing a treatment where no adequate therapy currently exists. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Reviews of NDAs within 12 months of submission (ten months after the Day 60 filing date) and Priority Reviews within eight months of submission (six months after the Day 60 filing date). Review processes may sometimes extend beyond these target completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding REMS or FDA workload issues, but in general under PDUFA the FDA is supposed to complete its reviews within the target timeframes despite these factors. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to the application’s approval. The recommendations of an advisory committee do not bind the FDA, but the FDA generally follows such recommendations.
Under PDUFA, NDA applicants must pay significant NDA user fees upon submission. In addition, manufacturers of approved prescription drug products must pay annual program fees.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with CGMP requirements and are adequate to ensure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. The FDA could also require a REMS plan which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may approve an NDA contingent on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials and the correction of identified manufacturing deficiencies, including the development of adequate controls and specifications. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Medical Devices
In the U.S., authorization to bring a medical device to market is generally obtained in one of two ways. The first pathway, a pre-market notification (the 510(k) process), requires demonstration that the new device is substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed medical device. The second pathway, a PMA, requires an independent demonstration that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. In general, pre-market approvals require a much longer time horizon and can be much more expensive than obtaining clearance through the 510(k) process.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must file with the FDA a pre-market notification demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. 510(k) clearance for iovera° was first obtained in March 2009 when the focus of MyoScience was cosmetic applications (i.e. facial wrinkle reduction). The MyoScience business focus shifted to pain management in 2014, and since then there have been a number of advancements that led to three additional 510(k) submissions and clearances to support iovera° and the subsequent growth of the iovera° product line.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 24


A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if it is determined that the device is not eligible for the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate reasonable evidence of the device’s safety and efficacy to the FDA’s satisfaction.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval, it may be changed or modified. Any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. Regulations provide that the manufacturer initially determines when a specific modification requires notification to FDA. The FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized and implemented, will result in manufacturers needing to seek a significant number of new clearances for changes made to legally marketed devices. The FDA reviews the manufacturer’s decision to file a 510(k) or PMA for modifications during facility audits.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
For pharmaceutical products, as an alternate path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, and permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from preclinical and/or clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA to permit the applicant to rely upon the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any change from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Applications under Section 505(b)(2) are subject to any non-patent exclusivity period applicable to the referenced product, which may delay approval of the 505(b)(2) application even if the FDA has completed its substantive review and determined the drug should be approved. In addition, 505(b)(2) applications must include patent certifications to any patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book as covering the referenced product. If the 505(b)(2) applicant seeks to obtain approval before the expiration of an applicable listed patent, the 505(b)(2) applicant must provide notice to the patent owner and NDA holder of the referenced product. If the patent owner or NDA holder brings a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of such notice, the 505(b)(2) application cannot be approved for 30 months or until the 505(b)(2) applicant prevails, whichever is sooner. If the 505(b)(2) applicant loses the patent infringement suit, the FDA may not approve the 505(b)(2) application until the patent expires, plus any period of pediatric exclusivity.
In any future NDA submissions for our product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize the commercial opportunities for these product candidates.
Post-Approval Requirements
Pharmaceuticals
After approval, the NDA sponsor must comply with comprehensive requirements governing, among other things, drug listing, recordkeeping, manufacturing, marketing activities, product sampling, distribution and annual reporting. Additionally, adverse events must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion, and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for adverse events are mandated by the FDA.
If new safety issues are identified following approval, the FDA can require the NDA sponsor to revise the approved labeling to reflect the new safety information; conduct post-market studies or clinical trials to assess the new safety information and implement a REMS program to mitigate newly-identified risks. The FDA may also require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the FDA-approved label. Further, if we modify a drug, including any changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the FDA may require us to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with CGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 25


strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from CGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
If after approval the FDA determines that the product does not meet applicable regulatory requirements or poses unacceptable safety risks, the FDA may take other regulatory actions, including initiating suspension or withdrawal of the NDA approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs.
In December 2015, we announced that we achieved an amicable resolution with the U.S. in our lawsuit filed in September 2015 against the FDA and other governmental defendants. The resolution confirmed that EXPAREL is, and has been since its approval in 2011, broadly indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. In April 2018, the FDA approved an expansion of the label for EXPAREL to include interscalene brachial plexus nerve block. The U.S. indication statement in the label for EXPAREL as approved by the FDA now reads: “EXPAREL is indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy has not been established in other nerve blocks.”
Medical Devices
The FDA has broad post‑market and regulatory obligations that we must adhere to. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with QSRs and other rules and regulations. 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
•QSRs, which require manufacturers, including third‑party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during product design and throughout the manufacturing process;
•Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off‑label uses; and
•Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 26


Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•the potential withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or other approvals that were previously granted; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or
•requiring us to repair, replace and/or refund the cost of any medical device we have manufactured or distributed.
If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
For example, in Europe, there are several tracks for marketing approval for pharmaceuticals, for product approval and post-approval regulatory processes, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all E.U. member states and is recognized by the MHRA. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.
As with FDA, EMA or MHRA approval, we may not be able to secure additional regulatory approvals in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, as in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing or distribution would apply to any product that is approved in Europe, and failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize any product.
In addition to regulations in Europe and the U.S., we will be subject to regulations governing clinical trials, product approvals, and commercial distribution in the United Kingdom, Canada, China and any other jurisdictions in which EXPAREL, iovera° or any other future product is approved.
Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our products and product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers at the federal, state and private levels. Government payer programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy is not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures, medical devices or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment that could impact our ability to sell our products at a price level high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment, which would materially impact our results of operations.
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 27


and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates owed to states by pharmaceutical manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act also established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which drug manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand name drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. There have been proposed in Congress a number of legislative initiatives regarding healthcare, including possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the Affordable Care Act. The full impact that the Affordable Care and other new laws will have on our business is uncertain. However, such laws appear likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products.
The marketability of our products may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical and medical device pricing. Some third-party payers require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies, or place limits on the amount of reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party payer reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers or that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available so that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Marketing/Data Exclusivity
The FDA may grant three or five years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for the approval of new or supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the application. Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. is available under Section 505A of the FDCA if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six-month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or non-patent exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. In the past, based on our clinical trial program for EXPAREL, the FDA granted three years of marketing exclusivity to EXPAREL, which expired in October 2014. In Europe, manufacturers qualify for 8 years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization approval and an additional two years of market exclusivity, for a total of 10 years of regulatory exclusivity.
Manufacturing Requirements
We must comply with the FDA’s CGMP requirements and comparable regulations in other countries. The CGMP provisions include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet CGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA and other authorities pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers we engage or with which we partner are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with these and other statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product or product complaints must be reported and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 28


Regulations Pertaining to Sales and Marketing
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug or device. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs, procedures or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or “sunshine” provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical and medical device pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective in February 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Environmental Matters
Our research and development processes and our manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and produce waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines and/or sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Cybersecurity
We operate a risk-based cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information. We utilize a layered approach in protecting against, and the detection of, cyber-attacks, and leverage outside 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 29


partnerships to gain intelligence on threats and continue to adjust our protection mechanisms to be effective. We also use state-of-the-art technology to monitor systems for anomalous behavior. In the event an incident were to occur, a Security Incident Response Team would be convened that consists of members from many functions, including legal counsel. Additionally, we carry a Cyber Insurance policy to help cover investigation and mitigation expenses.
Although we have numerous controls to protect against common attacks, some attacks may still be effective. Our controls are designed to detect, triage and eradicate these attacks. Over the past three years, there have been no known material breaches, and no expenses related to the investigation of such breaches.

This includes a variety of tools to promote total wellbeing in the areas of health, wealth, work and life to keep our employees and their families healthy, lower their healthcare costs and reduce stress. For example, we provide access to free biometric screenings, an employee assistance program, or EAP, and host in-person and webinar trainings on stress management and other EAP benefits, access to telemedicine including mental health visits, a health advocate service to help employees and their families navigate the healthcare system, activity challenges and more. Benefits that protect financial wellbeing are also provided, including but not limited to: a paid parental leave benefit, insurance to help protect assets during times of short- and long-term disability, life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, financial education seminars on savings, debt and other financial topics, access to discounts on a

variety of products and services and an incentive to engage in a new or maintain a wellbeing activity. In addition, we maintain a recognition program based on our core values, known as Celebrate, through which we recognize each other’s commitment to making a meaningful difference for our patients and communities and create a shared culture where everyone is responsible for living up to and sustaining our core values.
We have a formal Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Program. It is our policy that everyone is entitled to a safe and healthful place to work. We recognize that accident prevention, employee wellness and efficiency of operations are directly related to quality, production and cost. Pacira operates its facilities in a manner that protects the health of its employees and minimizes the impact of its operations on the environment.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to intentionally cultivating a culture of inclusion where all feel welcomed and valued for their backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. We hold one another accountable to promote trust and transparency in support of our communities and collective purpose. In support of this diversity, equity and inclusion vision, we have developed a strategy and multi-year roadmap, prioritizing education and training. Our executive team and senior leaders have received training on Unconscious Bias and Inclusive Leadership. Additionally, we have established a project team and employee council to shape our strategy around four key areas: leadership development, diversity recruiting, culture and communications. We are committed to evaluating our people processes to ensure we are attracting, developing, promoting and retaining diverse talent.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The health and safety of our employees has always been important to us, which is why we took responsible action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We covered the cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment for our employees and covered family members under our benefit plans and extended our paid sick leave for COVID-related absences. We amended our 401(k) savings plan to enhance loan eligibility and repayment terms and to permit certain distributions. We implemented additional safety protocols and guidelines at our manufacturing sites and required our non-manufacturing personnel to work from home, including our field sales force and clinical education teams which continue to support our customers remotely. With the reopening of many states, the ability of our sales representatives to renew their in-person engagement efforts, in conjunction with these remote efforts, has occurred across all sites of care, with more focus on physician offices and ambulatory surgical centers. Our offices have since re-opened on a voluntary basis with strict safety and hygiene guidelines implemented, and we continue to support remote working as appropriate.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 624 employees, all of which are full-time. All of our employees are located in the U.S. except for eight located in England and one located in the Netherlands. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
