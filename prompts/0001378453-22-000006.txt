Item 1. Business
Business Overview
TravelCenters of America Inc. is a Maryland corporation. We operate or franchise 280 travel centers, standalone truck service facilities and a standalone restaurant. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants and franchisees.
As of December 31, 2021, our business included 276 travel centers in 44 states in the United States and the province of Ontario, Canada, primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, operated primarily under the "TravelCenters of America," "TA," "TA Express," "Petro Stopping Centers" and "Petro" brand names. Of these travel centers, we owned 51, we leased 181, we operated two for a joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest and 42 were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We operated 232 of our travel centers and franchisees operated 44 travel centers, including two we leased to franchisees. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as a wide range of truck repair and maintenance services, diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, full service restaurants, or FSRs, quick service restaurants, or QSRs, and various customer amenities.
As of December 31, 2021, our business included three standalone truck service facilities operated under the "TA Truck Service" brand name. Of these standalone truck service facilities, we leased two and owned one. Our standalone truck service facilities offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and roadside services to large trucks.
As of December 31, 2021, our business included one standalone restaurant that we operated for a joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest.
On April 21, 2021, we completed the sale of our Quaker Steak & Lube, or QSL, business for $5.0 million excluding costs to sell and certain closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report for more information about the sale of our QSL business.
We manage our business as one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning fuel and nonfuel products and services because they facilitate our discussion of trends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. We have a single travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, that we do not consider material to our operations.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 14,250 people on a full time basis and 2,850 people on a part time basis at our travel centers, standalone truck service facilities and standalone restaurants and we employed an additional 865 people in field management, corporate and other roles to support our locations. Approximately 46 of our employees at two travel centers are represented by unions. For more information regarding our employees, please refer to "Human Capital Resources" below.
Recent Significant Events
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization, declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, and, in response to the outbreak, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary declared a public health emergency in the United States and many states and municipalities declared public health emergencies. Various governmental responses attempting to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus have negatively impacted, and continue to negatively impact, the global economy, including the U.S. economy. 
We believe that our travel centers and the truck drivers that we serve are critical to sustaining a resilient supply chain to support essential services and daily commerce across the United States. To date during the COVID-19 pandemic, our business has benefited from an increased demand for e-commerce and from being recognized by various governmental authorities as a provider of services essential to businesses, which allowed us to continue operating our travel centers through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken various actions and have incurred additional costs in response to the pandemic to address its operating and financial impact and to protect the health and safety of our customers, employees and other persons who visit our travel centers and restaurants. However, if there is another economic downturn as a result of the continued impact of the pandemic, demand for the transporting of products across the United States by trucks may decline, possibly significantly. If that occurs, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely impacted. 
The U.S. economic conditions have improved significantly in the United States from the low points experienced during the pandemic. Commercial activities in the United States rebounded and grew in part due to government spending on pandemic relief, infrastructure and other matters. This recent economic growth may have had some impact on our sales as during 2021 our diesel fuel sales volume increased 10.6% and total nonfuel revenues increased 11.4%, as compared to the prior year. 
Government and market responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused supply chain and labor availability issues, which at times have resulted in reduced availability of goods and inflationary pressures; inflationary pressures have continued into 2022 and remain heightened. The ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health crisis is highly uncertain. If these challenges continue, or if governments take further actions in response to these challenges, our business, results of operations and financial position may be negatively impacted. We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business and intend to respond to developments accordingly.
As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to determine what the ultimate impact will be on our and our customers', vendors' and other stakeholders' businesses, operations, financial results and financial position.
Growth Strategies
Our Transformation Plan consists of numerous initiatives across our organization for the purpose of expanding our travel center network, improving and enhancing operational profitability and efficiency, and strengthening our financial position all in support of our core mission to return every traveler to the road better than they came. 
We also intend to expand our scope of products and services and our customer segments through investments of capital and human resources in our truck service business, particularly our TA Truck Service Emergency Roadside Assistance®, TA Truck Service Mobile Maintenance® and Commercial Tire Network™ programs. Each of these programs, as further described below under the heading "Operations – TA Truck Service," can service our traditional long haul trucking customers as well as other truck owner customers we historically have not served.
Our recent franchising, development and acquisition activities are summarized as follows:
Travel Centers. Since the beginning of 2019, we entered into franchise agreements for 59 travel centers to be operated under our travel center brand names, including 26 new agreements in 2021. Four began operations during 2019, ten began operations during 2020 and five began operations during 2021, and we expect the remaining 40 to open by the second quarter of 2024.
Typical improvements we make at recently added or refreshed travel centers include adding truck repair facilities and nationally branded QSRs, paving parking lots, rebranding gasoline offerings, replacing outdated fuel dispensers, installing DEF dispensing systems, adding biodiesel blending, changing signage, installing point of sale and other IT systems and general building and cosmetic upgrades. The cost of capital improvements to recently purchased travel centers are often substantial and require a long period of time to plan, design, permit and complete; and, after being completed, the improved travel centers require a period of time to become part of our customers' supply networks and produce stabilized financial results. Depending on the extent of the improvements we estimate that the travel centers we acquire generally will reach financial stabilization approximately one to three years after completion of improvements, but actual results can vary widely from this estimate due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and we cannot be certain that acquired locations will operate profitably. For instance, the acquisition of an existing franchised travel center or site refresh could have a financial stabilization period of one year or less, whereas the new construction or significant overhaul of a newly-franchised or company-owned travel center could take up to three years to reach financial stabilization.
On October 28, 2019, we entered into a multi unit franchise agreement with IHOP Franchisor LLC, or IHOP, in which we agreed to rebrand and convert certain of our FSRs to IHOP restaurants over five years, or the IHOP Agreement. Concurrent with entering into the IHOP Agreement, we entered into a Secured Advance Note with IHOP, or the IHOP Note, pursuant to which we can borrow up to $10.0 million in connection with the costs to convert our full service restaurants to IHOP restaurants. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no loans outstanding under the IHOP Note.
Our Travel Centers
Our typical TA or Petro branded travel center includes:
•over 24 acres of land with parking for approximately 200 tractor trailers and 100 cars;
•a FSR and one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;
•a truck repair facility and parts shop;
•multiple diesel and gasoline fueling points, including DEF dispensers at the diesel lanes; and
•a travel store, game room, lounge and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.
Our typical TA Express branded travel center includes:
•approximately 10 acres of land with parking for approximately 70 tractor trailers and 50 cars;
•one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;
•multiple diesel, gasoline and DEF fueling points; and
•a travel store and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.
Substantially all of our travel centers are full service sites located on or near an interstate highway exit and offer fuel and nonfuel products and services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
Our travel center locations offer a broad range of products and services designed to appeal to our customers, including:
•Fuel. We sell unbranded diesel fuel at separate truck fueling lanes and we sell gasoline and diesel fuel at motorist fuel islands. As of December 31, 2021, we offered branded gasoline at approximately 264 of our locations and unbranded gasoline at nine of our travel centers operated by our franchisees and two of our travel centers operated by us.
•Diesel Exhaust Fluid. DEF is an additive that is required by most truck engines manufactured after 2010. As of December 31, 2021, we offered DEF from dispensers on the diesel fueling island at approximately 265 of our travel centers and plan to have DEF dispensers available in all lanes at our travel centers by the end of 2022.
•FSRs and QSRs. Most of our TA and Petro branded travel centers have both FSRs and QSRs, and our TA Express branded travel centers have one or more QSRs that offer customers a wide variety of nationally recognized branded food choices. The substantial majority of our FSRs within our travel centers are operated under our Iron Skillet® and Country Pride® brands and offer menu table service. At certain travel centers we have converted the FSR to a franchised brand, such as IHOP®, Black Bear Diner®, Fuddruckers® and Bob Evans®. We are carefully evaluating other opportunities to drive value within our FSRs. We also operate approximately 53 different brands of QSRs, including Popeye's Chicken & Biscuits®, Subway®, Burger King®, Taco Bell®, Pizza Hut®, Dunkin'® and Starbuck's Coffee®. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 183 of our travel centers included a FSR, approximately 170 of our travel centers offered at least one QSR and there were a total of approximately 473 QSRs in our 276 travel centers.
•Truck Service. Most of our travel centers have truck repair and maintenance facilities. Our 247 truck repair and maintenance facilities typically have between two and eight service bays and are staffed by service technicians employed by us or our franchisees. These shops generally operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and road services, ranging from basic services such as oil changes, wheel alignments and tire repair to specialty services such as diagnostics and repair of air conditioning, brakes and electrical systems and diesel filter cleaning. Our repair and maintenance services are generally covered by our warranty. In addition to work we perform at our facilities, we also provide roadside emergency truck repair, call center and off site truck repair and maintenance services, as described under the heading "Operations – TA Truck Service" below.
•Travel Stores. Travel stores located in our travel centers have a broad merchandise selection of more than 25,000 items. The General Merchandise selection is designated to support the professional driver's lifestyle while on the road. It includes the latest electronics, oil and additives, hardware and tools, clothing, and cab and bunk supplies. The Convenience offering includes cold beverages, candy, salty snacks, sweet treats, and traditional grocery items such as meal solutions, pet supplies, and health and beauty products. Each store has fresh food, pre-packaged meal solutions, snacks to grab, freshly brewed coffee, and cold fountain drinks. Each store has unique gifts for guests to buy for family or friends, whether it's a holiday or moment to celebrate. Guests can also purchase regional souvenirs to remember their trip by.
•Parking. We have a total of approximately 75,000 parking spaces, of which 49,000 are tractor trailer parking spaces and 26,000 are car parking spaces. Many of our travel centers offer the Reserve-It!® parking program, which allows drivers to reserve for a fee a parking space in advance of arriving at a travel center. As of December 31, 2021, we offered the Reserve-It!® parking program at 227 of our travel centers and we had dedicated a total of approximately 6,580 parking spaces for this program. 
•Additional Driver Services. We believe that trucking fleets can improve the retention and recruitment of truck drivers by directing them to visit large, high quality, full service travel centers with plentiful overnight parking such as ours. We offer commercial trucker and other customer loyalty programs, the principal program being the UltraOne® Program, that are similar to frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Under our loyalty programs, drivers receive points for diesel fuel purchases and for selected nonfuel products and services. These points may be redeemed for discounts on nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. Some of our travel centers offer casino gaming. We strive to provide a consistently high level of service and amenities to professional truck drivers at all of our travel centers, which we believe make our travel centers an attractive choice for trucking fleets. Most of our travel centers provide truck drivers the amenities including:
•specialized business services, including an information center where drivers can send and receive faxes, overnight mail and other communications;
•a banking desk where drivers can cash checks and receive funds transfers from fleet operators;
•wi-fi internet access;
•a laundry area with washers and dryers;
•private showers;
•free exercise facilities; 
•areas designated for truck drivers only, including a theater or big screen television room with a video player and comfortable seating; and
•ample parking including Reserve-It! parking.
Operations
Fuel. We sell fuel to our customers at prices that we establish daily or are indexed to market prices and reset daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, diesel fuel and gasoline revenues represented approximately 87.1% and 12.9%, respectively, of our total fuel revenues. We use discounting as a principal form of competition to grow our business with key customers and channels. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 89.9% of our diesel fuel sales volume was sold at discounts to posted prices under pricing arrangements with fleet customers. We have numerous sources for our diesel fuel and gasoline supply, including nearly all of the large oil companies operating in the United States. We purchase diesel fuel from various suppliers at rates that fluctuate with market prices and generally are reset daily. By establishing diesel fuel supply relationships with several alternate suppliers for most locations, we believe we are able to effectively create competition for our purchases among various diesel fuel suppliers, and also to capitalize on favorable purchasing opportunities that are accretive to our fuel margin. We also believe that purchasing arrangements with multiple diesel fuel suppliers may help us avoid product shortages during times of diesel fuel supply disruptions. At some locations, however, there are few suppliers for diesel fuel in that market and we may have only one viable supplier. Generally we have single sources of supply for gasoline at each of our locations. We offer biodiesel at a number of our travel centers and have a limited number of suppliers for this product at those sites. We continually monitor our fuel purchasing, pricing, supply and inventory management and take actions we believe appropriate that are intended to improve fuel margins.
A large majority of truck drivers use a payment method known as truck "fuel cards" that allow truck drivers to purchase fuel and other products and services, and permits trucking companies to track fuel and other purchases made by their drivers throughout the United States. Most of our trucking customers transact business with us by use of these fuel cards, most of which are issued by third party fuel card companies. Currently, the fuel card industry has only two significant participants, FleetCor Technologies, Inc., the parent of Comdata Inc., or Comdata, and its subsidiaries, or FleetCor, and WEX Inc., and its subsidiaries, or WEX. Also, we hold a minority interest in a joint venture with Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores, Inc., or Love's, that owns QuikQ LLC, or QuikQ. QuikQ is an independent full-service fuel payment solutions provider, which is currently used by a limited number of our trucking customers. We believe almost all trucking companies use only a single fuel card provider and have become increasingly dependent upon the data, reports and other services provided by their respective sole fuel card provider to manage their fleets and simplify their data processing.
Generally, our fuel purchases are delivered directly from suppliers' terminals to our locations and we do not contract to purchase substantial quantities of fuel to hold as inventory; however, we may do so in the future. We generally have only a few days of diesel fuel and gasoline inventory at our travel centers. We believe our exposure to market price increases for diesel fuel and gasoline is partially mitigated by the significant amount of our diesel fuel and gasoline sales that are sold under arrangements that include pricing formulae that reset daily and are indexed to market prices and by us generally not purchasing fuel for delivery other than on the date of purchase. Additionally, there has historically been a significant correlation over time between the indices used in our sales contracts and those used in our purchasing contracts. Due to this correlation, we historically have not engaged in any fixed or hedged price fuel contracts.
Non-Fossil Fuel and Alternative Energy. In anticipation of the possible changes that may eventually affect our industry regarding fuel and energy use, we are evaluating our long term strategies to position ourselves to efficiently and successfully adapt to these changes. These industry changes may include increasing adoption of the use of non-fossil fuel and alternative energy. Among these changes may be the use of electric vehicle technologies, which have been led initially by the automotive and light duty truck industries and more recently followed by leaders in commercial trucking, as well as hydrogen fuel, natural gas and other possible sources. While we believe that we are in the preliminary stages of evaluating these changes, we believe that a defined strategy, with dedicated internal resources, is important as we position ourselves to successfully incorporate these changes into our business. While we are currently increasing our biodiesel blending capabilities, as well as expanding our ability to offer DEF at the pump, we are also preparing for the future. This preparation may include dedicated internal leadership, the possibility of the creation of joint ventures and partnerships, as well as the potential for direct capital investments in infrastructure. One current example is that we are preparing to offer hydrogen fuel for sale at one of our sites, and we continue to actively explore other opportunities regarding alternative fuels and energy such as electric vehicle charging for medium and heavy duty trucks.
Nonfuel Products. We have many sources for the large variety of nonfuel products that we sell. We have developed supply relationships with several suppliers of certain nonfuel products, including Daimler for truck parts, Bridgestone Corporation, Continental AG, Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Michelin North America, Inc. and Yokohama Tire Corporation for truck tires, Core-Mark Holding Company Inc. for tobacco and other travel stores products, U.S. Foods for restaurant food products and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Equilon Enterprises LLC doing business as Shell Oil Products U.S., or Shell, and Chevron Corporation for lubricants. We maintain two distribution centers to distribute certain nonfuel products to our locations using a combination of contract carriers. We believe these distribution centers allow us to purchase, maintain and transport inventory and supplies at lower costs.
TA Truck Service. In addition to the truck repair and maintenance services provided at our travel centers, we also provide customers a wide variety of "off site" repair and maintenance services, as described below.
•TA Truck Service Emergency Roadside Assistance ® is a roadside truck service program that operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week. As of December 31, 2021, this program included a fleet of approximately 600 heavy duty professionally maintained emergency vehicles equipped with GPS technology at our travel centers and other sites and third party roadside service providers in 49 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces with a total of approximately 14,000 locations. We centrally dispatch our service trucks and third party service providers from our call center to assist customers with comprehensive repair services when they are unable to bring their trucks to our travel centers due to a break down. 
•TA Truck Service Mobile Maintenance ® offers truck and trailer mobile maintenance and repair services performed by certified technicians at customer facilities, with a fleet of approximately 333 trucks in service as of December 31, 2021. TA Truck Service Mobile Maintenance is designed to be a "bay on wheels" fully stocked with standard and specialty parts and state of the art technology that offers various services such as pre-trip truck inspections, U.S. Department of Transportation required inspections, tire repair and replacement, electric systems checks, brake inspections, used truck inspections and complete lubrication services.
•TA Commercial Tire Network ™ is a commercial tire program we began in late 2016 through which we sell a variety of branded tires at our truck repair and maintenance facilities, on customers' lots, distribution centers, through direct sales and under tire manufacturers' national fleet account programs. The TA Commercial Tire Network ™ includes a tire retread facility that is part of the Goodyear Authorized Retread Network, providing a full line of Goodyear commercial tire retread products to fleets, local industries and tire dealers within a 150 mile radius of its location in Bowling Green, Ohio. Many of our truck service facilities have access to the retread tires produced at this plant. We believe the TA Commercial Tire Network ™ is the most comprehensive commercial tire purchasing, monitoring and maintenance program in the United States.
Competition
Fuel and nonfuel products and services can be obtained by trucking companies and truck drivers from a variety of sources, including national and regional full service travel centers and pumper only truck stops, some of which are owned or franchised by large chains and some of which are independently owned and operated, and some large service stations. In addition, some trucking companies operate their own terminals to provide fuel and services to their own trucking fleets and drivers. Some of our competitors may have more resources than we do and vertically integrated fuel and other businesses which may provide them competitive advantages. For all of these reasons and others, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
We believe that although the travel center and truck stop industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 6,500 travel centers and truck stops in the United States, the largest trucking fleets tend to purchase the majority of their fuel from us and our two largest competitors. Based on the number of locations, Pilot Travel Centers LLC (which includes the Flying J brand), or Pilot, Love's and TA are the three largest companies focused principally on the travel center industry. We believe that in recent years, both of our principal competitors, Pilot and Love's, added significantly more travel centers to their networks than we added to our network, and in some cases, competition from new sites added by Pilot and Love's may have impacted our results. Nevertheless, we believe we are able to compete successfully in part because many of our travel centers were originally developed years ago when prime real estate locations along the U.S. interstate highway system were more readily available than they are today, which we believe would make it difficult to fully replicate our travel center business, and also in part because of our full service offerings and larger locations that are not often replicated by our principal competitors. We compete with other travel center and truck stop chains based primarily on diesel fuel prices and the quality, variety and pricing of our nonfuel products, services and amenities. 
Our truck repair and maintenance facilities compete with other providers of truck repair and maintenance facilities, including some at Pilot and Love's locations. These two competitors have increased their respective numbers of truck repair and maintenance facilities and service offerings over the past several years. For truck maintenance and repair services, we also compete with regional full service travel center and smaller truck stop chains, full service independently owned and operated travel centers and truck stops, fleet maintenance terminals, independent garages, truck and commercial tire dealerships, truck quick lube facilities and other parts and service centers. We also compete with other FSRs, QSRs, mass merchandisers, electronics stores, drugstores, gasoline stations and convenience stores. Some truck fleets own their own fuel and repair and maintenance facilities; however, we believe the long term trend has been toward a reduction in these facilities in favor of obtaining fuel and repair and maintenance services from third parties like us. We believe that we are able to compete successfully because we offer consistent, high quality products and services, and our nationwide travel centers provide an advantage to large trucking fleets, particularly long haul trucking fleets, by enabling them to (i) take advantage of efficiencies afforded by the wide array of products and services our travel centers provide for their equipment and their drivers and (ii) reduce the number of their suppliers by routing their trucks through our broad nationwide footprint of travel centers.
An additional source of competition in the future could result from commercialization of state owned interstate highway rest areas. Some state governments have historically requested that the federal government allow these rest areas to offer fuel and nonfuel products and services similar to that offered at a travel center and certain congressional leaders have historically supported such legislation. If commercialized, these rest areas may increase the number of locations competing with us and these rest areas may have significant competitive advantages over existing travel centers, including ours, because they are generally located on restricted (i.e., toll) roads and have dedicated ingress and egress. 
Our Leases with SVC
We have five leases with SVC, four of which we refer to as the TA Leases and one of which we refer to as the Petro Lease, and which we refer to collectively as the SVC Leases.
SVC Leases. Pursuant to the SVC Leases, we lease 144 properties under the TA Leases and 35 properties under the Petro Lease. One of our subsidiaries is the tenant under the leases, and we guarantee the tenant's obligations under the leases.
Term. The TA Leases expire on December 31, 2029, 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Petro Lease expires on June 30, 2035. We may extend each of these leases for up to two additional periods of 15 years.
Annual Minimum Rent. As of December 31, 2021, our aggregate annual minimum rent payable to SVC under the SVC Leases was $243.9 million. We may request that SVC purchase approved renovations, improvements and equipment additions we make at the leased properties, in return for an increase in our annual minimum rent equal to the amount paid by SVC multiplied by the greater of (i) 8.5% or (ii) a benchmark U.S. Treasury interest rate plus 3.5%. SVC is not required to purchase any improvements and we are not required to sell any improvements to SVC. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not sell to SVC any improvements we made to properties leased from SVC.
Percentage Rent. Under the SVC Leases, we incur percentage rent payable to SVC. The percentage rent is 3.5% of the excess of nonfuel revenues for any particular year over the percentage rent base year amount.
Deferred Rent. Under the SVC Leases, we owed deferred rent to SVC in an aggregate amount of $70.5 million, which became payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2019. The total amount of deferred rent outstanding as of December 31, 2021, was $22.0 million. Interest does not accrue on this deferred rent obligation, subject to exceptions. This deferred rent obligation may be accelerated by SVC and become due on an earlier date and interest shall begin to accrue thereon upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control of us.
On March 9, 2021, we and SVC amended one of the SVC Leases to reflect the renewal of a third party ground lease at one of the 179 travel center properties that we lease from SVC. This ground lease, which was previously accounted for as an operating lease, is now accounted for as a finance lease.
The lease amendment is further described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report. For more information about the terms of the SVC Leases, please refer to Part I, Item 1. "Business – Our Leases with SVC" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report.

TA, TA Express and Petro Franchise Agreements and Franchise Lease Agreements
Our franchise agreements with regard to TA, TA Express and Petro travel centers and our lease agreements with regard to our two leased franchised travel centers have not materially changed since December 31, 2019. For more information about the terms of those franchise agreements, please refer to Part I, Item 1. “Business – TA, TA Express and Petro Franchise Agreements” and “Business – Franchisee Lease Agreements” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Regulatory Environment
Environmental Regulation
Extensive environmental laws regulate our operations and properties. These laws may require us to investigate and clean up hazardous substances, including petroleum or natural gas products, released at our owned and leased properties. Governmental entities or third parties may hold us liable for property damage and personal injuries, and for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs incurred in connection with any contamination and regulatory compliance at our locations. We use both underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks to store petroleum products, natural gas and other hazardous substances at our locations. We must comply with environmental laws regarding tank construction, integrity testing, leak detection and monitoring, overfill and spill control, release reporting and financial assurance for corrective action in the event of a release. Investigation and remediation of both surface spills and subsurface releases is handled by contracted third party consultants and managed by our environmental staff. At some locations we must also comply with environmental laws relative to vapor recovery or discharges to water. Under the terms of the SVC Leases, we generally have agreed to indemnify SVC for any environmental liabilities related to properties that we lease from SVC and we are required to pay all environmental related expenses incurred in the operation of the leased properties. We have entered into certain other arrangements in which we have agreed to indemnify third parties for environmental liabilities and expenses resulting from our operations.

For further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, see the disclosure under the heading "Environmental Contingencies" in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report. In addition, for more information about these environmental and weather events and climate change matters and about the risks which may arise as a result, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including "Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," Item 1A. "Risk Factors," and Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis – Environmental and Climate Change Matters."
Franchise Regulation
Subject to certain exemptions, the Federal Trade Commission regulations require that we make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees and some states require state registration and delivery of specified disclosure documentation to potential franchisees. Some state laws also impose restrictions on our ability to terminate or not renew franchises and impose other limitations on the terms of our franchise relationships or the conduct of our franchise business. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act imposes special regulations on franchises where petroleum products are offered for sale. Also, a number of states include, within the scope of their petroleum franchising statutes, prohibitions against price discrimination and other allegedly anticompetitive conduct. These provisions supplement applicable federal and state antitrust laws. We believe that we are in compliance with all franchise laws applicable to our business.
Gaming Regulation
Because we have gaming operations at some of our travel centers, we and our concerned subsidiaries are currently subject to gaming regulations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Requirements under gaming regulations vary by jurisdiction but include, among other things:
•findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to, or licensure of, certain of our and our licensed subsidiaries' directors, officers and key employees and certain individuals having a material relationship with us or our licensed subsidiaries;
•findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to certain of our security holders and restrictions on ownership of certain of our securities;
•prior approval in certain circumstances by the relevant gaming authorities of offerings of our securities;
•prior approval by the relevant gaming authorities of changes in control of us; and
•specified reporting requirements.
Holders of beneficial interests of our voting securities are subject to licensing or suitability investigations by the relevant gaming authorities under various circumstances including, generally, service on our Board of Directors, the attainment of certain levels of ownership of a class of our voting securities, or involvement in the gaming operations of or influence over us or our licensed subsidiaries. Persons or entities seeking to acquire control of us or our operation of the license are subject to prior investigation by and approval from the relevant gaming authorities. Any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required by a relevant gaming authority to file an application and have their suitability reviewed in certain circumstances, including if the gaming authority has reason to believe that such ownership of our voting securities would otherwise be inconsistent with its state's gaming laws. In some jurisdictions, the applicant must pay all costs of investigations incurred in connection with such investigations. Additionally, in the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a person or entity is unsuitable to be an owner of our securities, such person would be prohibited from, among other things, receiving any dividend or interest upon such securities, exercising any voting right conferred through such securities or continuing to hold our securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by such gaming authority, managing the licensed business and, in some cases, the stockholders may be required to divest themselves of our voting securities.
Certain of our and our subsidiaries' directors and officers must also file applications, be investigated and be licensed or found suitable by the relevant gaming authorities in order to hold such positions. In the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a director, officer, key employee or individual with whom we or our licensed subsidiary have a material relationship is unsuitable, we or our licensed subsidiary, as applicable, may be required to sever our relationships with such individual or such individual may be prohibited from serving as our director or officer.
Any violations by us or any of our licensed subsidiaries of the gaming regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties (including the limiting, conditioning, suspension or revocation of any licenses held) and criminal actions. Additionally, certain jurisdictions, such as Nevada, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports regarding those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
We have a Gaming Compliance Plan, or the Compliance Plan, as required by the Nevada Gaming Commission in connection with our gaming operations at certain of our travel center locations. In connection with the Compliance Plan, we have a Gaming Compliance Committee, or the Compliance Committee, on which a member of our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors serves as the Board of Directors' liaison to the Compliance Committee pursuant to the terms of the Compliance Plan. The Compliance Committee assists us in monitoring activities relating to our continuing qualifications under applicable gaming laws.
Seasonality
Our sales volumes are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters than the second and third quarters of each year. In the first quarter, the movement of freight by professional truck drivers as well as motorist travel are usually at their lowest levels of the calendar year. In the fourth quarter, freight movement is typically lower due to the holiday season. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences as our rent expense and certain other costs do not vary seasonally. The COVID-19 pandemic has, and economic conditions occasionally in the past have, significantly altered the seasonal aspects of our business, and they may have similar impacts in the future. 
Human Capital Resources
Our core mission is to “Return every traveler to the road better than they came.” Our five values, Welcoming, Empathetic, Integrity, Openness and Team Player, define the behaviors we expect from our employees and we maintain and enforce our Diversity Statement. We have a longstanding history of supporting the professional truck drivers who keep the U.S. economy moving and those who have served our country, including both retired and active-duty military. We are committed to supporting the local communities we serve.
During 2020, we embarked on a company wide Reorganization Plan that included senior leadership appointments, resulting in an experienced and strategic management team tasked with improving our profitability, operational efficiency, and diversity. 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 18,000 employees with 4.8% employed at our corporate headquarters and 95.2% across 236 company-owned locations throughout the United States. Approximately 79.2% of our field employees were classified as full-time employees and the average tenure of our employees was four years. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, marital status, ancestry, sex, gender, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, handicap, military service or veteran status, genetic information or membership in any other category protected by applicable federal, state or local law. Diversity and inclusion are an important part of our hiring, retention and development programs. As of December 31, 2021, 46.2% and 38.4% of our employees were female and non-white, respectively, and 43.0% and 29.0% of our Board of Directors were female and non-white, respectively.
Our employee engagement, immersion and training initiatives center around our Mission Vision & Values. Our recruiting, on-boarding and retention programs and development of on-going training programs currently include the following:
•National Training Center. We maintain a national training center in Lodi, Ohio where we host educational programs to develop employees by teaching new skills and relevant technological changes.
•Manager in Training Program. This training program assists non-management and new management employees in learning the skills and experience to help enable them to advance their career and benefit our business and operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 142 field employees were promoted from non-manager to management level positions.
•Healthy Journeys Wellness Plan. We value the health and well-being of all our employees. For this reason, we offer the Healthy Journeys Wellness Program to help eligible employees and their spouses manage their health while controlling their family's healthcare costs. The program includes many resources to support wellness, including online health courses and a smoking cessation program.
•Educational Assistance Plan. Eligible employees can participate in TA’s Educational Assistance Plan for tuition reimbursement. We pay up to 75.0% of the cost of tuition and certain fees for any approved course taken by a regular full-time employee at an accredited high school, university or college, trade, business or correspondence school. Eligible truck service technicians who graduated from a certified technical school and have education related loan repayment obligations can also earn funds to repay their loan.
