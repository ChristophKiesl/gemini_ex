Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a global animal-health technology and services company dedicated to supporting the companion, equine, and large-animal veterinary markets. Our mission is to provide the best products, services, and technology to veterinarians and animal-health practitioners (“Customers”) across the globe, so they can deliver exceptional care to their patients (“Animal Owners”) when and where it is needed. In February 2019, we combined the complementary capabilities of the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice, bringing together leading practice management software and supply chain and distribution businesses with a technology-enabled prescription management platform and related pharmacy services. We believe our approach to the market will support the delivery of improved veterinary care and the health of their practices while driving increased demand for our products and services. 
History and Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Delaware in April 2018 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Parent under the name HS Spinco, Inc., and subsequently changed our name to Covetrus, Inc. Prior to the spin-off, affiliates of Covetrus purchased from certain minority holders their ownership interests in the applicable operating companies of the Animal Health Business. On February 7, 2019, Henry Schein completed the spin-off of its Animal Health Business and transferred the applicable assets, liabilities, and ownership interests to us (the “Separation”) and distributed all the shares of our common stock that were then owned by Henry Schein to its stockholders of record as of January 17, 2019 (the “Distribution”). Also, on February 7, 2019 and prior to the Distribution, we sold $361 million in shares to accredited institutional investors (the “Share Sale”). The proceeds from the Share Sale were paid to us and distributed to our Former Parent. Concurrent with the Distribution, we paid a cash dividend of $1.2 billion from loan proceeds from our newly established credit facility (see Note 8 - Debt). We then acquired Vets First Choice in an all-stock transaction (the “Acquisition”) and the following day, our shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CVET.
In January 2020, we entered into (i) a definitive agreement to sell our scil animal-care business (“scil”) to Heska Corporation, and (ii) an agreement to combine our subsidiary operating in Spain and Portugal with Distrivet S.A. Both transactions are expected to close during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. See Note 3 - Held for Sale and Note 19 - Subsequent Events.
Global Operations
In connection with the Separation, Distribution, and Acquisition, we made significant changes to our organizational management and reporting structure. As a result, we revised our reportable segments from (i) supply chain and (ii) technology and value-added services to (i) North America, (ii) Europe, and (iii) APAC & Emerging Markets. While the historical business was focused on driving growth through specific product and service offerings to our Customers, the Separation, Distribution, and Acquisition allowed for the integration of the different products and service offerings, along with prescription management, data analytics, and insights through veterinary practice management software, into one multi-channel veterinary platform. We will focus on delivering this platform of products and services to our Customers on a geographical basis. We provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in the Form 8-K dated May 7, 2019. See Note 18 - Segment Data.
The table below shows the percentage of net sales by segment for the last three years: 

Percent of Net Sales by Segment (a) | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017

Our Products and Services
Below is a graphic representing our major product categories currently available to the market and certain of our products and services: 
Supply Chain Services
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services and value-added solutions for enhancing practice revenue, operating efficient practices, and delivering high-quality care. By combining our extensive infrastructure and logistical expertise with robust software and ordering tools, a broad product offering at competitive prices, a suite of add-on business and financial services, and a strong commitment to customer service, we strive to be an indispensable and trusted partner for our Customers’ evolving needs.
Software Solutions
We offer technology solutions and services, including practice management software, data-driven applications, client communications tools, and related services, which are designed to increase staff efficiency and improve business health, allowing the veterinarian more time to provide patient care. We develop, provide, and support veterinary practices with a wide range of veterinary software systems. We also offer solutions that integrate with our software platforms, including client communication services, reminders, data backup services, hardware sales and support, and credit card processing. These integrated veterinary marketing services leverage practice-level data and consumer insights to deliver highly personal, relevant, and timely communications, strengthening the veterinary-client patient relationship and improving Animal Owners loyalty. Our payment solutions also help veterinarians save time and money with credit card processing services, which we build into our veterinary software systems to streamline workflow.
Prescription Management
Our technology-enabled prescription management platform empowers veterinarians with insights and pharmacy services that are designed to increase engagement and veterinary practice health. Our prescription management platform, which integrates into veterinary practice management software and workflow, leverages insight and analytics, client engagement and outreach communications, and integrated veterinary pharmacy services and is designed to improve medical compliance. We work directly with veterinary practices to provide client and practice-level insights and identify gaps in medical care. By doing so, we seek to enable our veterinarian Customers to manage the lifecycle of a prescription to create new revenue opportunities, adapt to changing animal-owner purchasing behaviors, and strengthen their client relationships through convenience of our e-commerce, auto-ship services, and access to accredited veterinary pharmacies with more than 20,000 products for standard prescriptions, preventatives, diets, and custom-compounded medications. These products and services ultimately allow our Customers to improve the quality of animal care that is provided.

Our Customers
Our customer base is comprised principally of animal-health and veterinary practices and clinics in the companion-animal and equine markets in North America, Europe, and APAC & Emerging Markets:

• | Supply chain Customers in North America, Europe, and APAC & Emerging Markets,


• | Software solutions Customers in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and certain other countries, and


• | Prescription management and pharmacy services Customers in the U.S.

These veterinary practices consist of both small, privately-owned businesses and an increasing number of corporate-owned practices. We also serve animal-health providers and producers in the large-animal market, primarily outside of North America. 
Sales and Marketing
Our supply chain sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify Customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives and contact from our inside sales team. Our prescription management and software businesses also have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and other marketing initiatives. We have also developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our relationships with strategic accounts and pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
Our combined sales and marketing teams include approximately 1,200 employees worldwide who generate new sales through direct and frequent communication with Customers and when requested, Animal Owners, facilitate order processing, stay abreast of market developments, and educate practice personnel regarding the hundreds of new products, services, and technologies introduced each year.

Sales and Marketing Employees by Segment | Number | % 
North America | 625 | 52.1 | %
Europe | 500 | 41.7 | %
APAC & Emerging Markets | 75 | 6.2 | %
Total | 1,200 | 100.0 | %

Our Strategy
As a recently formed and publicly-listed company, we have prioritized what we believe are the necessary building blocks to our independent operations and future success: (i) establishing reliable worldwide Customer support alongside a continuing and planned elimination of our reliance on our Transition Service Agreements (“TSAs”) with our Former Parent, (ii) increasing coordination across our business units and technology capabilities as we phase-in our global integration efforts, and (iii) strengthening our capabilities so that we will be able to penetrate our Customer base across our various markets to tap into growth opportunities. We made notable progress in 2019 in addressing these building blocks:

• | We made progress establishing a corporate infrastructure, including the people and the technology, necessary to support finance, human resources, information technology, and legal capabilities, among other functions, across Covetrus, including exiting 18 TSAs in 2019.


• | We made significant investments in our portfolio of software solutions and technology-enabled prescription management platform that improved customer service and workflow and delivered deeper integration and coordination between our prescription management and software solutions businesses. We started the process of combining our prescription management and software services teams as one phase of our integration efforts.


• | We had early success in cross-selling and penetrating our existing Supply Chain Services Customer base with our Prescription Management platform, delivering an increased number of enrollments on this platform, and increasing growth in our specialty pharmacy and compounded medications businesses.


• | We manufacture products and develop solutions for certain of our European businesses, our proprietary products and services offerings, as well as engage third parties to manufacture products on our behalf that we sell with Covetrus branding. We experienced further adoption of these proprietary and Covetrus-branded products and solutions inside our existing customer base as our integration efforts continued.

As we continue to expand on our 2019 accomplishments, our priorities entering 2020 continue to be centered on further strengthening our team and culture, and pursuing the specific strategies that will help us better achieve our mission as an organization, which is to provide the best products, services, and technologies to animal-health practitioners across the globe, so they can deliver exceptional care to their patients when and where it is needed. Our strategic goals are customer-centric and are designed to help animal-health practitioners (primarily veterinarians) deliver improved outcomes for their practices and their clients. We expect to meet our goals by (i) focusing and streamlining our businesses, (ii) synchronizing our global capabilities, and (iii) accelerating our growth while expanding our products and services offerings. 
Team
We must remain an attractive employer to capitalize on the relationships, relationship building potential, and wealth of knowledge that our employees possess and ensure these employee attributes can be translated into value creation. We strive to create a high-performing, Customer-centric culture that is operating as one team that embraces our values. We seek to leverage a passion for caring for animals that strives for continuous improvement, education, and advancement with competitive wages and benefits for our staff.
Focus
We will continue to streamline and focus our business by maximizing effectiveness and efficiency to deliver more consistent and profitable performance. We may also look to divest non-core assets, such as the scil animal care transaction announced in January 2020, and we plan to better manage our infrastructure spending, and complete our separation efforts from Henry Schein as we exit all TSAs by the end of 2020.

• | For our supply chain business, we are targeting reduced costs to serve our Customers and making investments in global sourcing to lay the foundation for potential margin enhancement. We also expect to drive additional growth in our proprietary and Covetrus-branded offerings that can drive greater value to our Customers and improve margins.


• | For our software business, we are building our product roadmap and making targeted investments in our capabilities to potentially improve functionality and workflow for our Customers. We will also continue to invest in customer support as we continuously look to provide higher service levels to our Customers.


• | For our prescription management business, we are leveraging the infrastructure investments we have made over the past two years to scale our business profitability. We plan to prioritize technology investments and drive tighter coordination with our software businesses while expecting to deliver efficiencies and improved product capabilities.

Differentiate
We are investing in our differentiated and higher margin proprietary products and solutions in 2020. We are focused on delivering better experiences and outcomes, which includes relentlessly seeking to advance our Customer successes, leveraging the power of our market insights, and investing in technology advancements and enterprise solutions. We are also leveraging technology across all facets of our business to deliver even greater value back to our Customers and manufacturer partners. Additional investment in support programs and product capabilities should also put us in a stronger position to differentiate our services and drive deeper engagement with our large Customer base. Utilizing our channel access to provide specialty pharmacy and compounded medications to a broader Customer base is also a priority for us. Finally, we will look to bring new products and solutions to market as we strive to be an indispensable and trusted partner for all our Customers’ evolving needs.
Globalize
In 2020, we will seek to more rapidly identify and better understand the needs of our global Customers and manufacturer partners to align our collection of capabilities together into a more integrated value proposition. This foundational focus should enable us to deliver on the global and cross-border opportunities we see moving forward more effectively. This will include building out the initial technology infrastructure necessary to deploy our prescription management platform outside the U.S. and bring some of our higher-margin proprietary products and solutions into new geographies. We expect to broaden our enterprise solutions to meet the needs of corporate groups that continue to acquire practices across geographies. Finally, we expect to capitalize on our global reach to deliver on the sourcing opportunity we see available to us.
Our Competition
The market for providing products, services, and technology to the global animal-health industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added services, service and delivery levels, credit terms, and customer support. Substantially all of the products we sell are available to Customers from a number of distributors, manufacturers and suppliers and, increasingly, some are being sold directly to Animal Owners and, as a result, significant price reductions by our competitors or changes in how products are ultimately procured by Animal Owners could result in competitive harm.
Our principal competitors include:

• | Animal Health Divisions of Traditional Distribution Companies: the MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.,


• | Animal Health-focused Companies: national, regional, and local full-service distributors, online commerce such as Amazon.com, Inc. and zooplus AG, retail and online pharmacy providers such as Chewy, Inc., PetMed Express, Inc., and Strategic Pharmaceutical Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a Vetsource), as well as manufacturers of animal-health products that sell directly to veterinary practices and retailers, thereby eliminating or reducing the role of distribution, and


• | Practice Management Service Providers: IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and several regional and local veterinary software vendors, including those offering cloud-based solutions.

Additionally, the growth in online and brick-and-mortar retailers offering certain animal-health products and services directly to Animal Owners continues to impact our Customers and, in turn, our business given our strategic alignment with the veterinary community. Our operating results may be materially adversely affected should this trend continue. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well-situated within the markets in which we compete. We expect that our comprehensive and integrated multi-channel capabilities that are focused on empowering care givers, providing expertise, and delivering global scale will allow us to maintain and strengthen existing Customer relationships, win new business, and unlock new demand and access additional revenue opportunities while addressing the evolving needs of our Customers, Animal Owners, and our manufacturing partners.
8

Seasonality
Our quarterly sales and operating results have varied from period-to-period in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future. In the companion animal market, sales of parasite protection products have historically tended to be stronger during the spring and summer months, primarily due to an increase in vector-borne diseases during that time, which correlates with our second and third quarters given that most of our business is in the northern hemisphere. Buying patterns can also be affected by manufacturers’ and distributors’ marketing programs or price increase announcements, which can cause veterinarians to purchase animal-health products earlier than when those products are needed. This kind of early purchasing may reduce our sales in the quarters these purchases would have otherwise been made. The sales of animal products can also vary due to changes in the price of commodities used in manufacturing the products and weather patterns, which may also affect period-over-period financial results. We expect our historical seasonality trends to continue in the foreseeable future.
Working Capital
Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs, debt service, strategic investments, build out of our infrastructure, and maintenance capital expenditures. We require substantial working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations in the level of accounts receivables and inventory purchase patterns, and seasonal demands throughout the year. We extend credit to many of our customers globally in the ordinary course of business, which increases accounts receivable balances within our business segments and is dependent, to an extent, on seasonal demand. Our sales terms vary from due immediately for credit card payments to significantly longer periods generally offered to larger customers. Inventory purchase activity and stock levels are also dependent on sales activity and seasonal demand, however, on occasion we consider special inventory buy-in opportunities to achieve better purchase terms and earn larger rebates. 
Intellectual Property
We own multiple trademarks, service marks and trade names that are important to our business. We believe that our trademarks are well recognized in the animal-health industry and by veterinarians and, therefore, are valuable assets.
Employees and Executive Officers
We have a knowledgeable team of over 5,500 employees worldwide (2,600 in the U.S.), including 5,100 full-time employees as of December 31, 2019. We view our employees as a critical factor to our success in strengthening our market position, innovating and driving the global adoption of our proprietary brands and solutions. We have identified our team as one of our four priorities in executing our strategy, see Our Strategy above. We believe we maintain positive relations with our employees. In certain countries, we are bound by union agreements negotiated by the employer's association with the respective union representatives. We are also party to shop agreements on workplace-related issues, negotiated with works councils at individual facilities that relate to those facilities.

Laws and Regulations
Our prescription management and pharmacy services business, which is currently conducted only in the U.S., is affected by federal and state laws and regulations governing, among other things, the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, marketing, and labeling of prescription and non-prescription drugs and related services. In addition, we are subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and comparable state regulations affecting the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industries, including state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards, state and federal controlled substance laws, and statutes and regulations related to FDA approval of the sale and marketing of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices. State pharmacy laws require pharmacies to be licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense prescription medications.
Our pharmacies are in Arizona, Maine, Nebraska, and Texas and dispense in all states. Non-resident pharmacies are licensed similar to resident pharmacies. As such, each prescription for a medication that is fulfilled by one of our pharmacies is generally 
10

covered by the laws of the state where the pet owner is located. The laws and regulations relating to the sale and delivery of prescription medications vary from state to state, but generally require that prescription medications be dispensed with the authorization from a prescribing veterinarian. We are authorized to dispense prescription medications in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
The sale of animal-health products is also governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products.
United States
The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal-health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) housed within the FDA. Generally, all animal-health pharmaceuticals are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be safe, effective, and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If the drug is for food-producing animals, potential consequences for humans are also considered. The FDA’s basis for approving a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports being provided to the CVM’s Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the law. Animal supplements generally are not required to obtain premarket approval from the CVM, although they may be treated as a food. Any substance that is added to, or is expected to become a component of, animal food must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation, unless it is generally recognized as safe, under the conditions of its intended use. Alternatively, the FDA may consider animal supplements to be drugs. The FDA has agreed to exercise enforcement discretion for such supplements if each such supplement meets certain conditions.
The regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biologics, such as vaccines, is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal-health vaccines, including immunotherapeutics. Marketing of imported veterinary biological products in the U.S. requires a U.S. Veterinary Biological Product Permit. Veterinary biologics are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious, as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-licensing monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events, or unexpected results are produced in accordance with USDA requirements.
The main regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary pesticides is the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. Animal-health pesticides are subject to pre-market review and must not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the U.S., pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
Under the Controlled Substances Act, distributors of controlled substances are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for their facilities from the DEA. Distributors are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times. Distributors are subject to inspection by the DEA.
Advertising and promotion of animal-health products that are not subject to approval by the CVM may be challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as well as by state attorneys general and by consumers under state consumer protection laws. The FTC regulates advertising pursuant to its authority to prevent “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC will find an advertisement to be deceptive if it contains a representation or omission of fact that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is material and if the advertiser does not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis, such as competent and reliable evidence, substantiating the claim. The FTC may attack unfair or deceptive advertising practices through either an administrative adjudication or judicial enforcement action, including preliminary or permanent injunction. The FTC may also seek consumer redress from the advertiser in instances of dishonest or fraudulent conduct.
States may require registration of animal drug distributors and wholesalers. Additional requirements may apply when the product is also a controlled substance. States work closely with the Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) in their regulation of animal food. The AAFCO’s annual Official Publication, contains model animal and pet food labeling regulations that states may adopt. The publication is treated deferentially by the federal and state government agencies that regulate animal 
11

food. Many states require registration or licensing of animal food distributors. States may also review and approve animal food labels prior to sale of the product in their state.
European Union
Veterinary medicines (which includes both prescription and over-the-counter products) must obtain a marketing authorization (“MA”) before they can be imported, marketed, and sold in any European Union (“EU”) member state. In broad terms, there are four different routes for obtaining MAs (i) a centralized EU-wide authorization procedure, (ii) national authorization procedures for each member state, (iii) a mutual recognition procedure involving at least two member states, and (iv) the decentralized procedure.
The centralized authorization route is used to obtain MAs for marketing and sale of veterinary medicines throughout all the EU member states as well as those countries in the European Free Trade Area (the “EFTA”). The European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) located in London is responsible for assessing applications made under the centralized route. The agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU. The agency has a specialized veterinary review section distinct from the human medical review section. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products is responsible for scientific review of the submissions for pharmaceuticals and vaccines. The EMA makes the final decision on the approval of products. Once granted by the European Commission (the “EC”) a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states and EFTA states. A series of Regulations, Directives, Guidelines, and EU Pharmacopeia Monographs provide the requirements for approval in the European Union. In general, these requirements are like those in the U.S., requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy, and consistency of manufacturing processes. The EMA works closely with the competent authorities of each member state in the regulation of veterinary medicines, including with respect to pharmacovigilance and testing for residues of veterinary medicines or illegal substances in animals and animal products.
Veterinary medicines can also be authorized on a national level through application to the relevant member state’s competent authority. If a product already has been authorized in at least one EU member state, then the mutual recognition procedure can be used to gain approval in other member states. Finally, the decentralized procedure may be used if the product is not authorized in any member state and the applicant would like authorization in several or all member states. This may occur where the centralized procedure is not mandatory, the product is not eligible for the centralized procedure or where the applicant does not wish to use the centralized procedure.
The EC must authorize animal feed additives. The European Food Safety Authority (the “EFSA”) assesses applications on behalf of the EC. The EFSA will analyze a sample of the feed additive and provide an opinion within six months of receiving the application. The EC will decide whether to grant or deny an authorization of the additive based upon this opinion. When authorized, all companies can (subject to any relevant third-party intellectual property rights) usually benefit from the authorization.
An EU regulation on animal medicines, which became effective in November 2018, relates to the advertising of veterinary products, in addition to various regulation that applies in individual EU member states. Health claims on animal pet food must not be misleading and claims that a food fulfills a nutritional need must be in line with the list of permitted claims that is published in an EU directive.
United Kingdom
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (the “VMD”) is the United Kingdom’s competent national authority responsible for overseeing the regulation of veterinary medicines in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). U.K. national applications follow an approach like centralized EU applications. The VMD is also responsible for post-market surveillance and adverse event reporting.
Australia
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (the “APVMA”) is an Australian government statutory authority established to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products in the Australian marketplace. Previously each state and territory government had its own system of registration. The primary legislation governing the APVMA’s activities is the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code, or the AgVet Code. The AgVet Code is in turn given force of law pursuant to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth).
The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can import, promote, and supply their products to the marketplace, and under the AgVet Code the APVMA must be satisfied that any active constituents or 
12

chemical products will not have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, occupational health and safety or trade, and that the product is effective for its intended use. Applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the APVMA’s scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, commonwealth government departments, and state agriculture departments. Labeling standards apply and pre-approval is required by the APVMA for veterinary chemical products. In addition, all advertising and promotion of products is subject to the Australian Consumer Law, which, like the U.S. and European Union, emphasizes accuracy and transparency in advertising and prohibits any misleading or deceptive conduct.
If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment, or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. As well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products, the APVMA reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period to ensure they are still effective and safe to use. The APVMA also reviews registered products when concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness. The review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or continuing registration with some changes to the way the product can be used. In some cases, the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market. The APVMA has the power to order compulsory product recalls and enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the requirements of the AgVet Code.
New Zealand
All veterinary medicines, agricultural chemicals and vertebrate toxic agents imported into New Zealand must be authorized under the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines (the “ACVM”) Act and regulations. The New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries maintains an ACVM Register of products that have been assessed to the ACVM Act registration information requirements and considered appropriate for registration. Conditions may be applied to such registration. The New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority (the “NZ EPA”) regulates the supply and use of hazardous substances. The NZ EPA operates various hazardous substances databases which can be searched to determine what controls have been placed on particular substances. Veterinary medicines that are hazardous substances require approval under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act before they can be imported or manufactured in New Zealand. Animal nutritional and animal care products are covered by a group standard approval.
Rest of world
Country-specific laws have provisions that include requirements for licensing, regulatory approvals, certain labeling, safety, efficacy, and manufacturers’ quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. Many other countries’ regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, the USDA, European Union, and other international animal-health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
