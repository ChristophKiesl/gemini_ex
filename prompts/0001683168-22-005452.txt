(b) | Business of Issuer
----+-------------------

 
JJY Holding Group is a developmental stage company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 4, 2007. Our plan of business has not been implemented but will incorporate trading agricultural products, food processing, and be a supply chain for supermarkets.
 
On September 29, 2020, Company changed its name in Nevada, the state of domicile, to JJY Holding Group.
 
At this time, the Company also cancelled its Convertible Series A Cumulative Stock and its Convertible Series B Cumulative Stock. There were no shares issued and outstanding.
 
At present financial revenue has not yet been realized. The Company hopes to raise capital in order to fund the acquisitions.
 
All statements involving our business plan are forward looking statements and have not been implemented as of this filing.
 
The Company is moving in a new direction, statements made relating to our business plan are forward looking statements and we have no history of performance. Current management does not have any experience in trading agricultural products, food processing, and supply chain management for supermarkets.
 
We feel that our business plan addresses the need for additional food chain supply on an international level.
 
 Our business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with a company whose business is in trading agricultural products, food processing, and supply chain management for supermarkets. 
 
The impact due to Covid-19 has accelerated already robust need for trading agricultural products, food processing, or supply chain management for supermarkets. COVID-19 has created a shortage of labor in some parts of China where it was winter harvest season during the crisis.
 
Disruption of the food distribution systems has caused considerable problems in sales of agricultural products, although demand is not met in the city during the COVID-19 period. To mitigate the adverse effects of the situation, measures have been taken to match production with sales to help both farmers and consumers. Specifically, the production is mainly connected to three types of buyers: (1) wholesale markets and distributors; (2) supermarkets and shops; (3) communities and neighborhood committees. Our business plan will help mitigate the shortage in the following ways:
 
Agricultural Products is generally taken to include
 

· | Rice, wheat, potatoes, tomatoes, cotton, oilseed, corn, soybeans, barley, tea, millet, peanuts
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-

 

The Company intends to implement its business plan upon raising capital. Subject to available capital, the Company intends to invest in:
 
Development
 

· | Identify areas of shortage in the agricultural trade industry 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Build a digital platform to support our business plan and manage the food supply chain
· | Assemble a management team to implement our business plan 
· | Hire a marketing and sales team 
· | Develop a business model that is compliant with governmental regulations 

Implementation
 

· | Contract with farmers and food processing plants 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Contract with supermarkets for delivery of our products to consumers

 
The analysis will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position of our trading agricultural products, food processing, or supply chain management for supermarkets to our competitors of similar size and experience within the agricultural and processing segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
· | Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance and other required items; 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in the marketplace; and 
· | Other relevant factors 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and implement our business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
As of the time of this filing, the Company has not implemented its business plan.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.

We may incur time and costs required to select and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective international education program that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
Competition
 
Our company expects to compete with many countries in the agricultural, food processing and supermarket supply chain management industry. In addition, there are several competitors that are larger and more profitable than the Company. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry changes and grows. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes. We believe that diligently establishing and expanding our funding sources will establish us in an already established industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our product offerings and supply chain management are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the change of the industry as a whole due to COVID-19 regulation will result in our food processing and supply chain management to supermarkets being more efficient due our control of the process from growing to delivery to supermarkets, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our future operations and results.
 
Compliance with agricultural and food processing guidelines will increase development costs and the cost of operating our business. In turn, we may not be able to meet the competitive price point for our end product dictated by the market and our competitors.
 
Again, these are forward looking statements and not an indication of past performance. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and have no merger candidates as of the time of this filing.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Upon effectiveness of this Form 10, we will be subject to the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under the Exchange Act, we will be required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also (1) requires steps be taken to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; (2) establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; (3) creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; (4) prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and (5) establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.
 
We will also be subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A. Preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are provided to our stockholders.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had one officer, three directors and no employees. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to begin implementing our business plan. In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to time on an as-needed basis.
