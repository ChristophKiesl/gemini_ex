GENERAL

In general

Our main business activity is content writing and editing services. We plan to deliver our services to both individuals and companies, as well as to printed or digital newspapers and magazines. Our main objective is to provide our customers with a quality service of text composing and editing of written materials. As additional services we may offer help with illustrating and designing of book covers, as we plan to hire professional designers if business turns out profitable. We plan to write the texts based on data provided by our customers by mail, by phone or directly in person during the interviews. We also plan to deliver services on writing creative texts such as pieces of fiction, poetry, blog posts, articles for magazines or newspapers. We also plan to deliver texts non related to fiction such as, business proposals, presentations, bids, customer offers and letters. We also plan to offer turning drafts of our customers into concise texts by editing or rewriting. We also plan to carry out the jobs of editing or rewriting texts to make them more appealing to the final reader, as well as to make them look professionally written. As business grows we may change our services to the needs of the markets or to the needs of the company or to meet the requirements of our customers.

Service

We plan to deliver single pieces of texts or consecutive series of them, as well as texts in large volumes such as books. We hope it may turn economically beneficial for the newspapers or magazines from where we expect to get multiple orders. At the initial stages we may promote our services by writing guest posts on different web blogs or blogs of Internet magazines. So we might expect more orders from them and start delivering articles. We have an idea of selling services by packages. Packages may include: composing texts, searching data to compose the text, proofreading and editing of the ready texts. The price for the package is about to be determined by the average market price for the similar services adding the price of editing, proofreading or amount of data per article to search. To meet the maximum of our customers needs we expect the prices of every package be negotiable and based on the specification of a certain project. For some additional fee we also intend to provide services on promoting our customers books on the Amazon, iBooks and similar services. We expect to receive orders online to our website as our customers may reside in any remote location, as well as the orders may be aimed at broad international public. We plan to use chatbots on the website to collect the orders from clients for our managers. In case if data in the order is insufficient the customers may be contacted via mail or directly by phone. Managers sort out the orders and hand them to the writers of the corresponding specification. We can expect to hire freelancers to work for us at a certain stage of development of our business or whenever there is a need in additional workforce. We can expect those freelancers to interview our customers in order to write the texts corresponding the customers needs. 

Our principal services may be split into the following groups:

Creative writing - assistance in writing complete books, manuscripts, biographies, stage plays or screenplays, or plots, or outlines for the works mentioned; 

Business writing - assistance in writing bids, proposals, letters, presentations, research papers;

Editing - editing and formatting services, completing or rewriting the texts of non-professional writers;

Publishing - finding a publisher, designing a book cover or illustrations.
 Once the customer chooses their package they agree upon the schedule of receiving and reviewing the work in progress.
