ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” “Guardion” the “Company” and the “Registrant” refer to Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
The Company is a specialty health sciences company (1) that has developed medical foods and medical devices in the ocular health space and (2) that is developing nutraceuticals that the Company believes will provide supportive health benefits to consumers.
Medical Foods:
 

● | Lumega-Z®: The Company formulates and distributes Lumega-Z®, which is designed to replenish and restore the macular protective pigment. A depleted macular protective pigment is a modifiable risk factor for retina-based diseases such as adult dry macular degeneration (“AMD”) and computer vision syndrome (“CVS”). The Company believes this risk may be modified by taking Lumega-Z to maintain a healthy macular protective pigment. Additionally, early research has shown a depleted macular protective pigment to be a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.

● | GlaucoCetinTM : In November 2018, the Company launched its second medical food product, GlaucoCetinTM. The Company believes GlaucoCetinTM is the first vision-specific medical food designed to support and protect the mitochondrial function of optic nerve cells and improve blood flow in the ophthalmic artery in patients with glaucoma. The parent compound of GlaucoCetinTM, called “GlaucoHealth,” was designed by Robert Ritch, M.D., one of the Company’s Medical Advisory Board members.

Medical Devices:
 

● | MapcatSF®: In 2016, the Company acquired the rights to a proprietary technology, embodied in the Company’s medical device, the MapcatSF®, which measures the macular pigment optical density (“MPOD”). On November 8, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued patent number 9,486,136 for the MapcatSF invention. Using the MapcatSF to measure the MPOD allows one to monitor the increase in the density of the macular protective pigment after taking Lumega-Z. The MapcatSF device is a Class I medical device under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) classification scheme for medical devices, which the Company has determined does not require pre-market approval. The Company’s focus is to deploy the MapcatSF in clinics accompanied by trained technicians to conduct the MPOD measurements and collaborate with the physicians treating their patients. The Company maintains ownership and possession of the MapcatSF when used in this fashion, but will sell the device to physicians upon request.

● | VectorVision, CSV-1000 and CSV-2000: In September 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary VectorVision Ocular Health, Inc., acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of VectorVision, Inc., a company that specializes in the standardization of contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, low contrast acuity, and early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (“ETDRS”) visual acuity testing. VectorVision’s standardization system(s) are designed to provide the practitioner or researcher with the ability to delineate very small changes in visual capability, either as compared to the population or from visit to visit. VectorVision develops, manufactures and sells equipment and supplies for standardized vision testing for use by eye doctors in clinics, for researchers to use in clinical trials, for real-world vision evaluation, and industrial vision testing. The acquisition expands the Company’s technical portfolio. 
 | In September 2019, the Company announced that it completed development of its new proprietary, digital CSV-2000 standardized contrast sensitivity testing device. The Company believes that the CSV-2000 is the only computer-generated vision testing instrument available that will provide the optical marketplace with the Company’s proprietary, industry-standard contrast sensitivity test, along with a full suite of standard vision testing protocols. The proprietary standardization methodology incorporated into the CSV-2000 includes a patented technology known as AcQviz, embodied in its own device, that automatically and constantly measures and adjusts screen luminance to a fixed standard light level for vision testing. The Company began selling the new CSV-2000 and AcQviz devices at the end of the first quarter of 2020 but was impacted by COVID-19. The Company plans to put significant focus on sales and marketing efforts of the new CSV-2000, although the CSV-1000 will continue to be sold. The Company believes the VectorVision product portfolio further establishes the Company’s position at the forefront of early detection, intervention and monitoring of a range of eye diseases. 

Nutraceuticals:
 

● | NutriGuard Acquisition: In September 2019, the Company acquired NutriGuard Research, Inc. The Company intends to build a portfolio of nutraceutical products under the NutriGuard brand by developing new formulations and marketing its products to patients directly through direct to consumer (“DTC”) channels and through recommendations by their physicians. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ImmuneSF: The first new nutraceutical product developed after the acquisition of NutriGuard is ImmuneSF, a unique proprietary nutraceutical formulation designed to support and maintain an effective immune system. This formulation contains a synergistic blend of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients. The Company has arranged for the manufacture and packaging of ImmuneSF at contract facilities in the United States and began marketing the product during the second quarter of 2020. The Company anticipates that ImmuneSF will also be exported for sales in international markets. 
● | In addition to NutriGuard’s ImmuneSF product, a Malaysian company contracted with NutriGuard to develop a proprietary formula to meet the demands of the Malaysian company’s customers for an immune-supportive product. Each unit of the product consists of two (2) bottles packaged together, one named Astramern-H and one named Astramern-V. The formula is designed to provide both immuno-supportive and anti-inflammatory benefits to its users.

Reverse Stock Split and Nasdaq Compliance
 
On September 20, 2019, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications staff (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer satisfied the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”). In accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company was afforded 180 days, or until March 18, 2020, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by evidence of a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. Thereafter, the Company had been afforded a second 180-calendar day compliance period (which 180-day period was extended due to circumstances related to COVID-19), or until November 30, 2020, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.
 
The Company was unable to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by November 30, 2020. Accordingly, on December 1, 2020, the Company received a letter from the Staff notifying it that its Common Stock would be subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely appealed Nasdaq’s determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the “Panel”). The Company timely appealed Nasdaq’s determination to the Panel.
 
On January 26, 2021, the Company received written notification that the Panel granted the Company an extension for continued listing through March 15, 2021. 
 
On March 1, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effectuate a one-for-six (1:6) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of its common stock without any change to its par value. Proportional adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split were made to the Company’s outstanding common stock, stock options, and warrants as if the split occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented in this Annual Report.

The letter stated the staff had determined that for the prior 10 consecutive business days, from March 1, 2021 to March 12, 2021, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock had been at $1.00 per share or greater and that accordingly, the Company had regained compliance under the Bid Price Rule, and that the matter was closed.
 
Background
 
Medical Foods
 
Medical foods are regulated as foods under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Company believes that there is an increasing level of acceptance of medical foods as a primary therapy by patients and healthcare providers to manage pain syndromes, sleep and cognitive disorders, obesity, hypertension, and viral infection. In clinical practice, medical foods are being prescribed as both a standalone therapy and as an adjunct therapy to low doses of commonly prescribed drugs. The Company believes that medical foods will continue to grow in importance over the coming years.
 
Lumega-Z® is a medical food product that has a patent-pending formula that is designed to replenish and restore the macular protective pigment simultaneously delivering critical and essential nutrients to the eye. Management believes, based on review of products on the market and knowledge of the industry, that Lumega-Z is the first liquid ocular health formula to be sold as a medical food (as defined in Section 5(b) of the “Orphan Drug Act”). However, the FDA has not monitored nor approved Lumega-Z as a medical food. Formulated by Dr. Sheldon Hendler in 2010, modifications were made over the lifetime of the formula to improve the efficacy, taste, and method of delivery. The current formulation has been delivered to patients and used in clinics since 2019.
 
Lumega-Z must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider. In order to reach the large, expanding AMD patient population, the Company primarily has marketed Lumega-Z to patients through ophthalmologists and optometrists. The Company intends to also market Lumega-Z through direct-to-consumer strategies such as, television, social media and paid search advertising.
 
Lumega-Z® has published two peer-review scientific articles, demonstrating its beneficial efficacy, in 2020. Both articles were published in the journal Nutrients. The first published study assessed the level of absorption of the carotenoids in Lumega-Z compared to absorption of the carotenoids in the industry leading eye vitamin, PreserVisionTM (AREDS 2 formula sold by Bausch and Lomb), and determined whether an elevated level of carotenoid absorption leads to increased MPOD. The study found that despite only a 2.3-fold higher carotenoid concentration than PreserVisionTM, Lumega-Z supplementation provides approximately 3–4-fold higher absorption, which leads to a significant elevation of MPOD levels (Nutrients 2020, 12, 132: Published May 2, 2020).The second study evaluated the visual benefits in a group of patients taking Lumega-Z compared to a group of patients taking AREDS 2 (PreserVisionTM) soft gel supplements, as well as a third control group taking no supplementation.. Each study participant had retinal drusen, significantly delayed dark adaptation recovery time and was at risk of developing vision loss from AMD. The results showed significant improvements in visual function, as measured by contrast sensitivity, in the group of patients taking Lumega-Z. The patients taking PreserVisionTM showed a trend toward an improvement, but no statistical change, while the control group showed no change. (Nutrients 2020, 12, 3271: Published October 26, 2020).

Sales of Lumega Z remained flat throughout 2020, as many eye doctor offices were closed, or operating with limited capacity, due to COVID-19 related “shelter at home” orders.
 
GlaucoCetin is the Company’s second medical food. It offers a patent-pending formula that is designed to support proper mitochondrial function in the optic nerve cells of glaucoma patients. Loss of optic nerve cells is thought to be the primary cause of vision loss in glaucoma patients. Like Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin has also been distributed primarily through eye doctors, however, the Company plans to offer direct-to-consumer marketing programs. GlaucoCetin sales grew by 112% during 2020. The Company believes this growth rate, despite COVID-19 related issues affecting patient access to eye doctor offices, is due to limited competition for glaucoma related nutritional products and a wider acceptance by clinicians of the potential efficacy of the nutritional therapies.
 
Vision loss from eye disease is a rapidly growing problem in the United States and across the globe. The National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine projects that “every four minutes, one American will experience partial or complete loss of sight.” According to The Lancet, AMD cases in the US are projected to pass 18 million in 2017, and 20 million by 2022. According to an EpiCast Report, the number of glaucoma patents is expected to grow yearly by 15% and for there to be 15.7 million cases worldwide by 2023, with most of these cases in the United States and Japan.
 
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took steps in 1988 to encourage the development of medical foods by creating a regulatory category for medical foods under the Orphan Drug Act. The term “medical food” as defined in Section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act is a “food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally (by mouth) under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.” This definition was incorporated by reference into the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990.
 
The field of candidates for development into medical foods is expanding due to continuing advances in the understanding of the science of nutrition and disease, coupled with advances in food technology thereby increasing the number of products that can be formulated and commercialized. The Company distributes its medical food products through E-commerce in an online store that is operated at www.guardionhealth.com. Information about VectorVision products can be found at www.vectorvision.com. Information about NutriGuard Formulations products can be found at www.nutriguard.com.
 
The Company also distributes its medical foods products through E-commerce in an online store that is operated at www.guardionhealth.com. The Company plans to expand its E-commerce capabilities in 2021.
 
Medical foods consist of food-based ingredients that are part of the normal human diet and are Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”) under FDA standards. Medical foods must make claims for which there is scientific evidence that nutrient deficiencies cannot be corrected by normal diet. All ingredients must be designated GRAS and used in therapeutic concentrations to address the particular nutritional needs of the patient. Medical foods are taken under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider who monitors and adjusts the food ‘dosage.’ In addition, under FDA guidelines and congressionally approved laws, medical foods do not require FDA preapproval but undergo continuous FDA monitoring and approval of label claims. Even though pre-market FDA approval is not required for a medical food, the official requirements and responsibilities for the manufacturer, in terms of safety, are greater than for dietary supplements, including solid scientific support for the formula as a whole. For these reasons, medical foods have greater guarantees of efficacy. In contradistinction, dietary supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and botanicals, do not require FDA preapproval, cannot make disease claims, are intended for normal people without disease or a condition and cannot claim that they prevent, mitigate or treat a given disease or condition. Dietary supplements do not require physician supervision and can be self-administered without supervision.

The Company believes that Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin are properly categorized as medical foods. While the Company believes it is unlikely the FDA would conclude otherwise, if the FDA determines Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin should not be defined as a medical food, the Company would need to relabel and rebrand that product. The Company believes there would be minimal impact on its operations and financial condition if it were required to change labeling and packaging to that of a dietary supplement. While reclassification and the subsequent relabeling and rebranding would be an added cost to operations, it would not change the use or effectiveness of Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin, although there is a chance that certain physicians may choose not to recommend Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin to their patients or that certain consumers may choose not to buy Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin if they are not classified as medical foods.
 
Medical Devices
 
The Company believes that consistent, repeatable and accurate results for visual acuity testing are of paramount importance for effective eye health care and for accurately establishing and enforcing the vision performance criteria required for certain professions. Variance in test lighting is a major cause of inconsistency in vision testing results. Standards for testing luminance, have been in place for more than three decades. However, recently, vision testing has evolved from the use of projection systems and charts to the use of digital displays. The Company believes that the variance in luminance provided by digital displays is large, and clinicians are now obtaining highly inconsistent results from practice to practice. Conservatively, the Company believes more than 250,000 eye care examination rooms are in use in the United States today.
 
The variability described above has caused the FDA and other agencies to require standardized test lighting for vision tests. Because VectorVision specializes in the standardization of vision tests, VectorVision is the only company that offers fully standardized vision testing products that ensure consistent, repeatable and highly accurate results using automated light calibration systems. The CSV-1000 device offers auto-calibrated tests to ensure the correct testing luminance and contrast levels for consistent, highly accurate and repeatable results, which is why the VectorVision instruments can detect and quantify subtle changes in vision. Consistency, repeatability and accuracy are also why the VectorVision CSV-1000 instrument is used worldwide by eye doctors in more than 60 countries to accomplish contrast sensitivity testing. The Company’s research has revealed there are no competing products that offer auto-calibration of ambient illumination or test lighting. Competitive devices do not correct for variations in test light levels, resulting in variability of test results. The CSV-1000 uses self-calibrated test lighting. The self-calibrated test lighting is proprietary. For the CSV-2000, the follow-on computerized device for the CSV-1000, the self-calibrated test lighting technology is a proprietary and patented technology known as AcQviz, which constantly measures the luminance of the CSV-2000 computer screen and automatically adjusts screen luminance to a fixed standard light level for vision testing. The test faces of the CSV-1000 are proprietary, and their intellectual property is protected under copyright and trade secret law. CSV-1000 is currently sold worldwide, and the Company expects this global distribution to continue. The first sale of the CSV-2000 occurred in Q1, 2020 and the Company believes this product will also be sold worldwide. There is a training requirement for incorporating the CSV-1000 and the CSV-2000 device into clinical practice, which the Company plans to provide as part of its commercialization strategy.
 
The MapcatSF device offers a proprietary technology to effectively evaluate the MPOD, which is a measure of the health of the macular pigment. The MapcatSF device is used primarily in eye doctor’s offices as a means to demonstrate to patients the current status of their MPOD and the potential benefits of Lumega-Z after treatment. The first MapcatSF was sold in 2020. No major sales and marketing strategy is currently planned for the direct sales of the device, as it will be used more as a measurement tool to educate patients and their eye doctors about the need for taking Lumega-Z to replenish the macular pigment. The MapcatSF will be sold to doctors or researchers upon request.
 
Nutraceutical Industry Overview
 
A dietary supplement is a defined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, enacted in 1994 (“DSHEA”), as “a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals; a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of the ingredients listed above. Dietary supplements are intended to be taken orally and are labeled on the front panel as being a dietary supplement.
 
DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of “foods,” not drugs, and requires the product to be labeled as a “dietary supplement.” The terms “dietary supplement” and “nutraceutical” are often used interchangeably.

-


Under DSHEA, a company is responsible for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading. Dietary supplements do not need approval from FDA before they are marketed, although “new dietary ingredients” do require premarket review by FDA. This allows companies to bring products to market in less time and with less cost than is required for drug approval from the FDA.
 
Competitive Advantage and Strategy
 
Medical Foods
 
There are no research-validated pharmaceutical solutions for slowing the progression of adult dry macular degeneration (“AMD”). As a result, physicians often recommend Age-Related Eye Disease Study (“AREDS”)-based supplements to early AREDS-based AMD patients. However, more than 90% of all AREDS-based nutritional products currently on the market are in tablet, capsule or gel capsule form, which have a low efficiency of absorption.
 
Lumega-Z is a medical food designed to enhance the bioavailability of “difficult to absorb” ingredients like carotenoids. In contrast to other formulations, Lumega-Z is a liquid formulated using a proprietary molecular micronization process (“MMP”) to maximize efficiency of absorption and to minimize compatibility issues. The MMP is a proprietary homogenization process whereby the particle size of the ingredients is reduced to facilitate more efficient absorption into the body. As noted earlier, clinical studies have shown Lumega-Z offers significantly higher absorption of carotenoids, than the leading AREDS-based formula PreserVisionTM (Nutrients, 12, 1321: Published May 2, 2020). In a subsequent study, Lumega-Z was also found to provide significantly better vision benefit than the AREDS-based formula in patients with drusen and at risk of vision loss from AMD, as measured by contrast sensitivity (Nutrients 12, 3271: Published October 26, 2020). The Company believes we have a competitive advantage with Lumega-Z because of these two published studies showing superiority over the leading formula, PreserVisionTM, and because a growing body of evidence, particularly the results from the AREDS studies, that has demonstrated the importance of supplementation with carotenoids to offset vision loss in patients with macular degeneration. Lumega-Z has demonstrated in studies to have higher absorption of carotenoids, which the Company believes leads to better visual outcomes, and a superiority over the competitive formulas.
 
GlaucoCetin is a medical food designed to support mitochondrial function in the optic nerve cells of glaucoma patients. For glaucoma, the primary risk factor for disease progression has been thought to be elevated intraocular pressure which in turn damages the optic nerve cells leading to vision loss. As such, the primary means for treating the disease, to slow or stop vision loss, is to lower the intraocular pressure through pharmaceutical or surgical means. However, new studies suggest that many glaucoma patients do not exhibit elevated intraocular pressure. Further, many patients who have displayed high intraocular pressure and have been treated to lower the pressure, continue to lose vision. These trends have led clinicians and researchers to suggest that other mechanisms of disease progression are occurring, one of which is mitochondrial dysfunction of optic nerve cells. The Company believes we have a competitive advantage with GlaucoCetin because it is the first to market medical food specifically designed to offset the mitochondrial dysfunction of cells in glaucoma patients.
 
Medical Devices
 
VectorVision specializes in the standardization of vision tests, specifically, contrast sensitivity, glare testing and early treatment diabetic retinopathy study, or ETDRS, acuity. The variability in test lighting has caused the FDA and other agencies to require standardized test lighting for vision tests. Contrast sensitivity testing measures how people see in the real world. A depleted macular pigment greatly affects contrast sensitivity. Research suggests that contrast sensitivity is a better measure than standard acuity tests for real-world vision applications such as military pilots and highway driving. The Company believes that VectorVision is the only company that offers fully standardized vision testing products that ensure consistent, repeatable and highly accurate results. These qualities are why the VectorVision instruments can detect and quantify subtle changes in vision, and why the VectorVision CSV-1000 instrument is used worldwide by eye doctors in more than 60 countries to accomplish contrast sensitivity testing. On July 10, 2018, the USPTO issued US Patent No. 10,016,128, titled Method and Apparatus for Visual Acuity Testing. This patent describes an invention pertaining to automatic light calibration of the display screens used for vision testing. The Company has acquired the exclusive rights to this patent, and its VectorVision CSV-2000 device embodies this invention. On July 17, 2018, the USPTO issued US Patent No. 10,022,045, also titled Method and Apparatus for Visual Acuity Testing, which describes a methodology to continuously calibrate display monitors to automatically hold display luminance constant for vision testing. This second patent also covers a methodology to compensate for other testing factors, such as room illumination and when patients view the vision test through a mirror, which is a common practice in eye doctors’ offices worldwide. The Company also acquired the rights to this patent. The Company’s new AcQviz device embodies this invention, which is now used in conjunction with the VectorVision CSV-2000 device.

The Company believes the CSV-1000 is the current standard of care for testing contrast sensitivity in clinical practice. The first sale of the CSV-2000 was made in February 2020. There is a training requirement in incorporating the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 device into clinical practice, which the Company plans to provide as part of its commercialization strategy.
 
The CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 offer self-calibrated test lighting for vision testing. The self-calibrated test lighting technology for both instruments is proprietary to the Company. The patented technology known as AcQviz, applies to the CSV-2000. It constantly measures the luminance of the display monitor of the CSV-2000 and automatically adjusts screen luminance to a fixed standard light level for vision testing. Although the CSV-1000 will continue to be sold, the Company plans to put a greater focus on sales and marketing efforts on the new CSV-2000. There can be no assurances that the marketing efforts will be successful, and sales of the CSV-2000 will be comparable or exceed sales of the CSV-1000. The Company believes we have a competitive advantage because of the unique and proprietary vision testing luminance standardization technologies employed by the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000. This standardization has led to the publication of many research studies showing the accuracy of the contrast sensitivity testing protocol used in both the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000, and to the publication of population normal ranges for contrast sensitivity. The Company believes that there are no other devices with published normative values for contrast sensitivity.
 
Nutraceuticals
 
The Company intends to build a portfolio, in addition to the current product line, of nutraceutical products under the NutriGuard brand by developing or acquiring new condition-specific formulations. NutriGuard markets these products to patients directly through direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels. The Company also intends to conduct research and publish papers demonstrating the efficacy of the NutriGuard products, which the Company believes will also lead to distribution of products to patients through recommendations by their physicians.
 
NutriGuard intends to formulate high quality scientifically credible nutraceuticals with a goal to become a globally respected and physician-preferred nutraceuticals brand. The Company believes its nutraceuticals can play an important role in optimizing, preserving and restoring health.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The Company believes that marketing its products is critical in ensuring its success. The Company has several marketing initiatives and will implement them according to the success and product feedback that the Company and products create. Marketing initiatives will include not only distribution through eye doctor recommendation, but also direct-to-consumer programs. The Company will also explore acquiring other companies, product lines and intellectual property that may be complementary or supplementary as part of its efforts to expand the business, which acquisitions could be for cash, stock or a combination thereof.
Sales Force
 
The Company plans to use a combination of digital strategies, virtual communication, direct-to-consumer campaigns and direct sales activity with eye doctors to promote its products. At the end of 2020, the Company had two highly experienced sales personnel, both Doctors of Naturopathy. During 2021, the Company intends to add sales team members in the field to conduct direct sales activities for eye doctors, to perform virtual educational campaigns for practice follow-up with doctors and their staffs and to support the direct-to-consumer campaigns. The Company also intends to initiate significant follow-on communication activity with patients who have begun taking the nutritional products, to spur higher compliance and patient retention.

International Expansion Strategy
 
The Company intends to continue to pursue strategies for distribution of its existing products and unique nutritional formulations in Asian markets. In the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company received its first order for a novel immune support product from the Malaysian company, Ho Wah Genting Berhad “HWGB.” The order was subsequently delivered in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The total order value was $890,000. The Company also has several products under development for the U.S. market, most notably a vision support and energy drink known as EPIQ-V, which the Company believes it may be successfully distributed in Asia.
Ocular Care
 
Based on management’s knowledge of the industry, the Company believes that Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin are the only medical foods in the ocular health space. Thus, with regard to the ocular health market no such data is available regarding medical foods. In an attempt to illustrate the market potential for Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin, the Company has examined ocular health products in the dietary supplement market as the closest appropriate data set available. The use of dietary supplements to enhance health and well-being is a longstanding and increasing trend. According to the Council for Responsible Nutrition, 73% of adults in the United States reported taking dietary supplements in 2020. According to Global Newswire, worldwide sales of supplements is estimated to reach $230.73 billion by 2027. Supplementation has recently generated much interest among eye health professionals, due largely to the publication of the AREDS study, which was supported by the prestigious US National Eye Institute, showing nutrition can potentially slow the AMD epidemic.

● | The prevalence of AMD appears to be lower and more variable in the developing nations as compared to more developed countries. Healthcare experts believe this will likely change for the worse with increasing life expectancy, changing lifestyles and increase in viewing computer monitors and other devices. 

 
Due to an aging population, the AMD, Glaucoma and Cognitive Decline epidemics are growing, creating a significant market for the Company’s products.
 
Marketing Lumega-Z to Practitioners
 
In order to reach the large, expanding AMD patient population, the Company has primarily marketed Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin to patients through ophthalmologists and optometrists. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 19,216 ophthalmologists and over 44,000 optometrists currently practicing. There are more than 213,000 ophthalmologists worldwide. This marketing reach will be achieved through a combination of collaboration with industry-specific publishers, peer-to-peer promotion using key opinion leader clinicians, organic and paid search engine optimization and marketing, and other content-driven & educational approaches.
 
The MapcatSF® has demonstrated itself to be an effective tool to promote Lumega-Z. The Company has determined that the value of the MapcatSF is through this utilization. The Company intends, as part of its efforts to directly target eye doctors as part of its marketing strategies, to continue to deploy the MapcatSF in this fashion, with a focus of assigning the MapcatSF to clinics to build and maintain relationships with the clinics and assist the physicians in making a determination to recommend Lumega-Z to their patients. The Company believes that continued deployment of MapcatSF devices in this fashion will build effective relationships with physicians and their clinics, expand the awareness of the Company’s products and increase sales of Lumega-Z.
 
As noted earlier, these marketing efforts targeting eye doctors will be supplemented by a variety of direct-to-consumer campaigns and the use of more efficient and cost-effective virtual strategies for educating and connecting with consumers.
 
Marketing the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 to Practitioners
 
Contrast sensitivity is currently one of the standard tests for clinical trials relating to ocular surgeries and treatments, and the CSV-1000 is considered the benchmark for these applications. In addition, there is an increasing need for functional vision assessment in everyday clinical practice, as a means of measuring the effect of disorders such as cataract and macular degeneration on the patient’s functional vision, and the impact of treatment of these conditions on the patient’s vision. The Company will concentrate its efforts on increasing the use of contrast sensitivity in everyday clinical practice, as a means of targeting the optometry and ophthalmology markets, which consists of over 34,000 and over 18,000 doctors, respectively, in the United States.
 
The Company expects to continue to sell the CSV-1000 for the foreseeable future and add the CSV-2000 to these marketing efforts. The CSV-2000 is not yet approved by the local organizations equivalent to the FDA in many countries, and this process can take up to one or more years. The CSV-1000 will continue to be sold exclusively in those countries during that time period. The Company sold its first CSV-2000 in February of 2020 and sold two units for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
The Company currently owns and has exclusive rights to 4 U.S. patents and 2 U.S. patent applications and 3 foreign patent applications covering its products and product candidates.

Trade Secrets
 
The MapcatSF® device employs a proprietary algorithm for correcting macular pigment optical density measurements with respect to lens density effects. More particularly, the proprietary algorithm adjusts the photopic luminosity function for the age equivalence of the subject’s lens using a relationship disclosed by Sagawa and Takahashi (J. Opt. Soc. Am. 18, 2659-2667). The algorithm is embedded in an integrated circuit block designed in such a way as to make it difficult to reverse engineer.
 
VectorVision’s CSV-1000 has proprietary testing charts that are not only copyright protected but can only be reproduced accurately by using special lithographs. These lithographs are kept secure, with very limited access, and are closely guarded trade secrets.
 
The AcQviz technology, the basis for vision test standardization for the CSV-2000 product line, is protected by two ITUS patents.
 
The formulations for Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin have been submitted for US patent protection.
 
Trademarks
 
The Company utilizes trademarks on all current products and believes that having distinguishing marks is an important factor in marketing its products. The Company has five U.S. registered trademarks on the principal register at the USPTO. These marks are listed below. The Company has three foreign registered trademarks for its products and product candidates at this time and is evaluating whether additional foreign trademark protection is appropriate. U.S. trademark registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms. The Company also currently has common law trademark rights for the use of its marks, including common law trademark rights to the NUTRIGUARD mark. Other trademarks include Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin, VectorVision, CSV-1000 and CSV-2000.
Copyrights
 
In addition to patent and trademark protection, VectorVision has three copyrights registered with the U.S. Copyright Office relating to the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 medical devices. VectorVision also has common law copyright protection on the testing charts contained in the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 medical devices, which includes Vision Testing Chart #1, Vision Testing Chart #2 and Vision Testing Chart #3.
Products Manufacturing and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company outsources the manufacturing of its medical food products, nutraceutical product line and medical devices to contract manufacturers. The Company processes orders through purchase orders and invoices with each manufacturer. The Company believes that there are multiple alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for its products in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor.
Government Regulation
 
Medical Foods
 
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (“FDCA”), products are regulated on the basis of their intended use. Their intended use is determined by the objective factors surrounding their use. Numerous categories and subcategories of products exist under the FDCA that could relate to the Company’s products, such as foods, food additives, dietary supplements, GRAS food components, new drugs, GRAS and Effective (“GRAS/E”) drugs for over the counter use, and GRAS/E drugs for use under the supervision of a physician. The categories overlap and products can fall within more than one category depending on their intended use.
 
The FDA is primarily responsible for regulating medical foods. A medical food is defined under the FDCA as a “food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.”
 

13
--


The FDA advises that it considers the statutory definition of medical foods to “narrowly” constrain the types of products that fit within the category of food. FDA regulations further describe medical foods as a product that: (i) is a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube; (ii) is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone; (iii) provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation; (iv) is intended to be used under medical supervision; and (v) is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
 
Medical foods do not require approval or review by FDA prior to marketing. FDA does not require pre-market safety or efficacy studies (similar to or comparable to Phase 2 & 3 trials for prescription drugs). However, a company must have data to demonstrate that the formula, when taken as directed, meets the distinctive nutritional requirements of the particular disease or condition.
 
Like any evolving area, especially where no premarket approval is required, the FDA reserves the right to raise questions about the qualification of products within any category. The Company and its Scientific Advisory Board examine the distinctive nutritional requirements of a disease.
 
The labeling for medical foods must comply with all applicable food labeling requirements, except for those specific requirements from which medical foods are exempt. Medical foods are exempt, for example, from the labeling requirements for nutrient content claims and health claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (see 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(5)(A)). As with all food labels, printing must be legible, and many required elements must be conspicuous, such as a statement of identity, which is the name of the food; the statement: “Must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider;” the quantity; the ingredients listing; the name and address of the distributor, among other requirements.
 
All ingredients in medical foods must be either generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or approved food-additives. Many ingredients have been determined by the FDA to be GRAS and are listed as such by regulation. Other ingredients may achieve self-affirmed GRAS status through a panel of experts on that particular substance that author a GRAS Report. The standard for an ingredient to achieve GRAS status requires not only technical demonstration of non-toxicity and safety, but also general recognition and agreement on that safety by experts in the field. All ingredients used in the Company’s medical foods are either FDA-approved food additives or have GRAS status. Because medical foods are typically taken with prescription drugs, the developer must assess whether any medical food/drug interactions pose a risk.
 
Medical foods manufacturers must register with FDA pursuant to the Bioterrorism Act before producing foods. Manufacturers of foods also must follow current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. Entities that manufacture, package, label or hold food products must follow applicable cGMP regulations. These regulations focus on practices that ensure sanitary and cleanly conditions of manufacturing facilities. The Company engages contract manufacturers to manufactures its medical foods. .
 
The Federal Trade Commission has primarily responsibility to regulate the advertising of foods, including medical foods. Under the FTC Act, all advertising claims, both express and implied, must be truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated.
 
Enforcement by the regulators is post-market, mostly via FDA inspections of food facilities, including packaging, distribution facilities, and fulfillment houses, as well as the manufacturer. The FDA and FTC also gathers material at trade shows and conferences and examine websites.

Nutraceutical Regulation
 
The FDA regulates nutraceuticals as “dietary supplements” under the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) as a separate regulatory category of food. Under DSHEA, a company is responsible for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading. Dietary supplements do not need approval from FDA before they are marketed. Except in the case of a “new dietary ingredient,” where pre-market review for safety data and other information is required by law, a firm does not have to provide FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety or effectiveness before or after marketing a product.
 
Dietary supplement manufacturers must register with FDA pursuant to the Bioterrorism Act before producing supplements. Manufacturers of dietary supplements also must follow current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. Entities that manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplement products must follow applicable cGMP regulations. These regulations focus on practices that ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength and composition of dietary supplements.
 
Congress defined the term “dietary supplement” in DSHEA as “a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals; a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of the ingredients listed above.” A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a “dietary ingredient” intended to supplement the diet. The “dietary ingredients” in these products may include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites and can also be extracts or concentrates. Dietary supplements are produced in the form of tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.
 
According to the FDA, a drug is an article intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. While nutraceuticals are not intended to cure or treat disease, both dietary supplements and drugs may be intended to affect the structure or function of the body. Dietary supplements that contain structure/function claims on their labels must bear the disclaimer: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and truthfulness of these claims; they are not approved by FDA. Moreover, dietary supplements are supposed to enhance the diet, not be used as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet, and not supposed to be taken alone as a substitute for any food or medicine.
 
The DSHEA requires that a manufacturer or distributor notify FDA if it intends to market a dietary supplement in the U.S. that contains a “new dietary ingredient.” A new dietary ingredient is an ingredient marketed after October 15, 1994. The manufacturer must demonstrate to FDA that the new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for use in a dietary supplement. There is no authoritative list of dietary ingredients that were marketed before October 15, 1994. Therefore, manufacturers are responsible for determining if a dietary ingredient is “new.”
 
Under DSHEA, a company is responsible for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading. Dietary supplements must meet all applicable regulations for food labeling. The DSHEA also requires certain disclaimers if structure/function or other health claims are made on the product label.
 
Medical Device Regulatory Requirements
 
To fall within the purview of the FDA, a product must first meet the definition of a “device” under the FDCA.. Section 201(h) of the FDCA defines a device as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is ... intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.”
 
FDA categorizes medical devices in three distinct classes based on the potential health risks to the public – Class I, Class II, and Class III. Device classifications are determined by the FDA based on the risk the medical device presents to the patient and the level of regulatory control required to ensure the safety and effectives of the device. Medical devices are classified as Class I, II or III based upon the controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and factors relevant to this determination include the device’s intended use, technological characteristics, and the risk to patients if the device were to fail. Class I devices, which are subject only to general controls, generally represent the lowest-risk category of devices, while Class III devices, which are subject to general controls and premarket approval, generally represent the highest-risk devices. Class II devices typically require premarket notification to FDA and clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA prior to marketing (unless an exemption applies).

The FDA also regulates the labeling and manufacturing of medical devices. Medical device manufacturers must register the facilities and list their devices with the FDA. Manufacturers are subject the current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, which govern activities such as the design, processing, testing, packaging, distribution, and storage of devices. Manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA.
 
While the FDA governs the labels and labeling of medical devices, the FTC governs the advertising of most devices. Under the FTC Act, all advertising claims, both express and implied, must be truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated.
 
The Company is registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer under registration number 3010367547. The MapcatSF is listed with the FDA as a Class I medical device. With the assistance of regulatory affairs consultants, the Company has determined the applicable product code for the MapcatSF is HJW and the applicable Code of Federal Regulation is 886.1050. The FDA has determined that this particular predicate device, and related product code, is a Class I medical device. Based on this, the Company believes the MapcatSF is correctly classified as a Class I medical device and does not require any premarket approval.
 
VectorVision is registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer under registration number 1527853. The CSV-1000, CSV-2000 and the ESV-3000 medical devices are listed with the FDA as Class I medical devices. The applicable product code for these devices is HOX and the applicable Code of Federal Regulation is 886.1150. As Class I medical devices, the CSV-1000, CSV-2000 and the ESV-3000 devices do not require premarket approval.
 
Stark Law
 
Congress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This law and its supporting regulations, which have been amended and expanded substantially, are commonly referred to as the “Stark Law,” and prohibit a physician from making any referral of a Stark Designated Health Service (“DHS”) to an entity with which the physician has any kind of financial relationship, unless all of the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception are met. Stark covered DHS include both outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostic testing that are reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have similar laws, some of which can apply to all payors and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that its arrangements with its customers are in compliance with the federal and any state Stark Laws, the Stark Laws present different levels of risks as to the Company’s two lines of business: (1) sale of the Company’s medical food, Lumega-Z, and medical device, the MapcatSF; and (2) the Company’s performance of TCD testing.
 
These products are neither prescription drugs nor are they reimbursable under any federal program at present. The federal Stark Law is thus inapplicable. Further, the Company’s believes that these products are also not covered under any potentially applicable state Stark Laws. The federal Stark Law, however, includes an exception for the provision of in-office ancillary services, including a physician’s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs, provided that the physician meets specified requirements. To the extent that the products might become reimbursable under a federal program, or otherwise become covered under the Stark Law, the Company believes that the physicians who use the Company’s medical device, the MapcatSF, purchase the CSV-1000, CSV-2000 or ESV-3000, or recommend its medical foods, Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin, to their patients are aware of these requirements. However, the Company does not monitor their compliance and has no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with Stark II. If it were determined that the physicians who use the Company’s medical device or prescribe medical foods purchased from the Company were not in compliance with Stark II, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Anti-Kickback Statute and HIPAA Criminal Laws
 
The federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”) applies to Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal programs. AKS prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase, or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of goods, including drugs, covered by the federal health care programs. At present, the Company does not participate in any federal programs and its products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or any other state or federal program. The AKS is a criminal statute with criminal penalties, as well as potential civil and administrative penalties. The AKS, however, provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” for particular types of transactions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws and their own anti-kickback laws, some of which can apply to all payors, and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with both federal and state AKS laws, the AKS laws present different levels of risks as to the Company’s two lines of business: (1) sale of the Company’s medical foods, Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin, and medical device, the MapcatSF; and (2) the Company’s performance of TCD testing.
 
At present, the Company’s products are not reimbursable under any federal program. If, however, that changes in the future and it were determined that the Company was not in compliance with the AKS, the Company could be subject to liability, and its operations could be curtailed. Moreover, if the activities of its customers or other entity with which the Company has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the AKS and the Company, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, the Company could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.
 
HIPAA Compliance and Privacy Protection
 
HIPAA established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: (1) health plans, (2) health care clearing houses, and (3) health care providers who conduct certain health care transactions electronically. Covered Entities must have in place administrative, physical and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Additionally, some state laws impose privacy protections more stringent than HIPAA’s. There are also international privacy laws, such as the European Data Directive, that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact the Company’s business in the future.
 
HITECH Act
 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act promotes the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology. The HITECH Act addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information, in part, through several provisions that strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of the HIPAA rules.
 
Physician Sunshine Act
 
Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. The Centers for Medicine and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.
 
Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act applicable organizations are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships they have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act preempts similar state reporting laws, although some companies may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, are ambiguous. Because the Company’s medical devices are Class I, not subject to premarket approval, and not reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program the Company believes it is not currently subject to the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements. As the Company pursues commercialization of its medical devices, these requirements will be reevaluated to determine their applicability to the Company’s activities.

The Federal False Claims Act
 
The Federal False Claims Act provides for the imposition of extensive financial penalties (including treble damages and fines of over $22,000 for every false claim) if a provider submits false claims to any governmental health program either knowingly or in reckless disregard or in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claims at issue. Liability under the False Claims Act can arise from patterns of deficient documentation, coding and billing, as well as for billing for services that are deemed not to have been medically necessary for the treatment of the patient. Many states have their own False Claims Acts as well. The Company was billing governmental health care programs for the TCD testing, and the False Claims Act is thus potentially applicable to the Company’s operations. The Company put in place a fraud and abuse compliance program that was designed to ensure that the Company’s documentation, coding and billing for TCD tests were accurate and compliant. Any patterns of uncorrected deficiencies in documenting, coding and billing for TCD tests, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.
State Regulatory Requirements
 
Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the Corporate Practice of Medicine (“CPOM”), anti-kickback and false claim regulations. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require that a physician obtain a license to dispense prescription products. When considering the commencement of business in a new state, the Company consults with healthcare counsel regarding the expansion of operations and utilizes local counsel when necessary.
 
Many states prohibit or otherwise regulate under CPOM rules the extent to which non-licensed personnel may be involved in the practice of medicine or otherwise employ licensed personnel. Related state rules further limit the extent to which fees for professional services may be shared or “split” between parties. Under the TCD Testing line of business, such rules in some states my impact the Company’s relationship with the radiologists who will be reading and interpreting the results of the TCD tests, and thereby providing the “professional component” of such tests. The Company is structuring its financial and billing relationships with such radiologists to be in compliance with applicable state rules. Failure to comply with state CPOM and fee splitting rules, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.
 
Other United States Regulatory Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of food and medical devices products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws. In addition, the Company may be subject to federal and state laws requiring the disclosure of financial arrangements with health care professionals.
Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 
The Company may eventually be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, product design, manufacturing, labeling, product registration and approval, and sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, generally the Company must obtain separate authorization for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in those countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The authorization or approval process varies from country to country.
