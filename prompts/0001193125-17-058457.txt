Our Network Solutions 
 Our network solutions are engineered to provide industry-leading cost, capacity, coverage, reliability and aero-performance. Our global satellite network is designed to meet the needs of the approximately 20,000 commercial aircraft comprising the global commercial aircraft market. Our ATG network targets approximately 22,000 business aircraft and commercial regional jets in North America. The amount of data delivered by our networks to and from aircraft increased 60% in 2016 compared to the prior year. We expect continued rapid growth in data volumes on our network. 

 | Global Satellite Solutions for CA: 2Ku/Ku. We operate a global Ku-band satellite network that is currently comprised of 27 satellites operated by SES, Intelsat and other major providers and 19 teleports owned and operated by Gogo. The capacity, speed, coverage and reliability of this network are continually being improved, as we incorporate additional satellites, including high throughput satellites (HTS), which are expected to come online beginning in 2017, and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites thereafter. We offer two types of airborne equipment that use this network, 2Ku and Ku. As of December 31, 2016, 2Ku was installed on 94 aircraft operated by five of our airline partners, and was awarded but not yet installed on approximately 1,400 aircraft. 2Ku employs two low-profile, proprietary satellite antennas with higher spectral efficiency, superior equatorial performance, and lower drag and fuel burn as compared to competing satellite antennas. 2Ku delivered peak speeds to the aircraft above 20 Mbps in 2016, and will deliver peak speeds above 100 Mbps in 2017, as HTS and our next generation modem are deployed. As of December 31, 2016, our Ku service also delivered peak speeds over 20 Mbps and will deliver peak speeds above 50 Mbps in 2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Global Satellite Solutions for BA: Iridium and SBB. BA provides global satellite services using the Iridium and SBB networks. We are the largest reseller of the Iridium satellite network to the business aviation market, providing primarily voice services. The SBB satellite network provides near global coverage from three geostationary Inmarsat satellites and delivers peak data transmission rates up to 432 Kbps.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | North American Solutions for CA-NA and BA: ATG-4/ATG. Our ATG network, uses 3MHz of licensed spectrum in the 850MHz band, approximately 250 terrestrial cell sites and a fiber optic backhaul network to deliver peak speeds of 3.1 Mbps for ATG and 9.8 Mbps for ATG-4 in the lower 48 states and parts of Canada and Alaska. We recently announced development of our next generation ATG network, which will leverage our existing ATG network by employing 60MHz of unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band, a proprietary LTE modem and a beam-forming antenna to produce an expected peak speed to the aircraft above 100 Mbps. This new ATG technology is expected to be available in 2018 and will be primarily targeted at larger business aviation aircraft and smaller commercial aircraft in North America.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our ATG network offers a smaller, lighter, less expensive and faster-to-install antenna, compared to satellite solutions, which reduces drag, fuel burn and associated operating costs for the market of approximately 22,000 business and commercial regional jets in North America that rarely fly over large bodies of water. As of December 31, 2016, we had 898 aircraft equipped with ATG service and 1,719 aircraft equipped with ATG-4 service in CA-NA, and 4,172 aircraft equipped with ATG service in BA. We expect to begin providing Gogo Biz 4G, an ATG-4 solution, on BA aircraft in 2017. 
 

 | Airborne Equipment. We offer complete packages of airborne equipment for each of our ATG and satellite technologies through after-market and OEM distribution channels. Airborne equipment includes modems, servers, wireless access points, and antennas. The antennas for Ku and 2Ku satellite services are more complex than the ATG antenna and require additional equipment to point the antenna at the satellite and a radome to cover the antenna. The equipment for approximately 200 of the 2Ku awarded aircraft will be installed by OEMs. For CA, we also offer installation, certification, and warranty and maintenance services. For BA, we tailor our equipment offering to accommodate a wide range of aircraft from small jets and turboprops to larger jets with global range. Approximately half of the airborne equipment installed on BA aircraft in 2016 was sold through OEMs.

Our Services 
 We generate a substantial majority of our service revenue from passenger connectivity services. Additional service revenue is derived primarily from wireless in-flight entertainment services and to a lesser extent from airline support services and emerging connected aircraft services. 
 

 | Passenger Connectivity Services. Our connectivity services allows passengers to connect to the Internet from their personal electronic devices and access corporate and personal applications, including streaming services on our higher capacity networks. In CA, we offer a variety of pricing options to passengers, airlines and third parties tailored by devices, routes, bandwidth and session durations, in addition to monthly and annual subscriptions. In BA, we offer a variety of connectivity services generally priced per aircraft per month.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Passenger Entertainment Services. Through Gogo Vision, our video-on-demand product accessible from passengers personal electronic devices, commercial and business aircraft passengers can access a large library of entertainment options, which currently include on-demand movies and television shows. In 2015, we introduced Gogo TV, which delivers live television content to passengers on satellite-equipped flights using our in-cabin network.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Connected Aircraft Services. Our emerging Connected Aircraft Services (CAS) enable commercial airlines and business aircraft operators to improve the passenger experience and enhance operational efficiency by leveraging the connectivity we provide to the aircraft. Key data from aircraft sensors, databases and crew inputs can be combined with ground inputs to provide comprehensive and real-time visibility into operations. For example, currently CAS supports route optimization, turbulence avoidance, electronic flight bag applications and real-time credit card processing and weather data.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Aircraft Operator Services. We provide the end-to-end capabilities required to accommodate a broad range of customers, which include the development of custom portals for passenger access, 24-hour network monitoring, performance reporting, and account support to manage connectivity programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths 
 

 | Innovative Network Technology. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for 25 years, as evidenced by the nine network technologies, six of which are proprietary to Gogo, that we have deployed during this time. In addition, we hold more than 100 patents, most of which relate to network technology. We currently offer the broadest and most innovative array of in-flight connectivity technologies available in the market, including 2Ku, Ku, ATG-4/ATG, SBB and Iridium and expect our next generation ATG technology to be available in 2018. The breadth of our technologies allows our customers to select the best solution based on aircraft sizes and routes. Our latest generation global satellite solution, 2Ku, will produce peak speeds to the aircraft above 100 Mbps in 2017, once HTS and our next generation modem are deployed. Our next generation ATG network will also have peak speeds in excess of 100 Mbps. We are also conducting research and development in areas that include LEO satellites and a fully electronic phased array antenna.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The open architecture of the 2Ku system enables us to obtain satellite capacity from several existing and anticipated satellite operators without the need for antenna swaps or other invasive changes to the aircraft. The open architecture is facilitated by our proprietary antenna design and our investments in modem and antenna positioner hardware and software. Our strategy does not include owning or operating satellites; rather, we prefer to lease satellite capacity to allow flexibility and adapt to the rapid innovations in the satellite industry. Several HTS will be launched by our providers in 2017 and 2018 and we expect the emergence of LEO satellites in the future. Satellite service providers often incorporate our research and development in the design and performance parameters of next generation satellites which we expect will improve global coverage and redundancy and increase capacity and peak speed. Our open architecture allows us to adapt to these innovations and to provide the bandwidth our customers and their passengers demand now and in the future.

 | Global Aircraft Operations. There are unique requirements that separate aviation from terrestrial markets and scale and expertise specific to this market are required for success. Gogo supports the largest fleet of connected aircraft in the world and we have acquired significant technological and operational know-how and developed long-term and robust supplier relationships in both business and commercial aviation. We installed or materially upgraded hardware on approximately 1,900 business and commercial aircraft in 2016. In commercial aviation, we have the capability to install ATG equipment overnight and satellite solutions within three days, and to deploy software upgrades remotely. During 2016, we provided maintenance to customer aircraft that flew more than four million flights to six continents during the year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Customizable Platform. Our customers require a hardware and software platform that allows connectivity-enabled services to be deployed quickly, easily and flexibly. For example, our airline partners have designed custom passenger portals that rely on Gogos platform for many functions, including user accounts and passwords, payments, entertainment and other stored content. Additionally, our platform provides hosting, reporting, data labels, storage and other capabilities for CAS. In 2016, our platform powered increasingly customized portals for ten airlines, supported more than 75 million visitors and processed more than 50 million connectivity sessions and entertainment views.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 The four key drivers fueling Gogos growth and financial performance are: increasing the number of Gogo-connected aircraft, increasing average revenue per aircraft, reducing investment per aircraft and improving margins. 
 Increase Number of Gogo-Connected Aircraft 
 Airlines have not yet made the decision to install broadband connectivity on nearly half of the global fleet of approximately 20,000 commercial aircraft and less than 20% of the global fleet of nearly 30,000 business aircraft is currently broadband connected. Furthermore, approximately 40,000 new commercial aircraft are expected to be produced over the next 20 years. We expect that nearly all of the worlds commercial aircraft and a rapidly increasing percentage of business aircraft will be broadband connected over the next decade. 
 

 | Commercial Aviation. As of December 31, 2016, we provided our services on 2,943 commercial aircraft, an increase of 14% from the prior year. In addition, we have definitive contracts, letters of intent or memorandums of understanding in place to install our equipment and provide our services on approximately 700 additional aircraft. Our growth strategy is to target the approximately 10,000 additional unserved existing aircraft by leveraging our established retrofit capabilities and the new aircraft market by increasing the availability of our systems for factory installation by Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Business Aviation. As of December 31, 2016, the business aviation market was comprised of approximately 22,000 business aircraft in North America and approximately 7,600 business aircraft in the rest of the world, and we had approximately 7,400 business aircraft online, principally in North America. We increased the number of broadband business aircraft online by nearly 800 in 2016. Our growth strategy is to continue to leverage our existing ATG network, broad suite of service options and recently announced next generation ATG network to expand in North America, and to use 2Ku and other satellite technologies to grow our business internationally. In 2016, we introduced cockpit services and expanded our pricing options by introducing hourly pricing plans targeting the untapped turboprop and light jet segments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Average Revenue per Aircraft 
 We expect to continue to grow average revenue per aircraft (ARPA) by increasing the take rates for passenger connectivity and the adoption of additional services, including entertainment and CAS. 
 Our strategies for increasing ARPA include the following: 
 

 | Increase Passenger Adoption of Connectivity. The adoption of mobile devices and the demand for continuous Internet access have surged in recent years, and most passengers now carry personal electronic
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 
 

devices in flight. This trend creates a significant opportunity for increased adoption of our services from the fewer than 7% of passengers on Gogo-equipped commercial aircraft who used our connectivity services in 2016. We expect passenger usage to increase significantly, and our goal is to connect every passenger on every aircraft through the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Network Capacity. Our technology roadmap provides the bandwidth for a ground-like experience, including video streaming, for all passengers on every flight. The greater than ten-fold increase in capacity and peak speed provided by 2Ku and next generation ATG, as compared to our ATG-4 technology, will enable rapid growth in passenger adoption.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand Payers and Services. With the introduction of 2Ku and the increased bandwidth speeds it provides, we can offer tiered services that allow passengers or airlines to select from various levels of functionality (for example browsing vs. streaming). To date, a majority of our CA service revenue has been paid by passengers. We expect service revenue from airlines and other third parties to grow, as airlines increasingly purchase bandwidth for their passengers and for their own use and as companies such as T-Mobile are paying Gogo to make our services available to their customers while in-flight. Through BA, we continue to introduce flexible pricing for our broadband and voice services, allowing aircraft operators and owners various options based on data usage, flight frequency and the number and size of aircraft serviced.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Usage of Wireless Entertainment. Gogo Vision was available on nearly all Gogo-connected aircraft in CA and approximately 190 BA aircraft as of December 31, 2016. Through our Gogo Vision platform, airlines offer passengers a library of movies and TV shows for wireless streaming to personal devices. In 2016, most of our airline customers stopped charging passengers for the service and began offering free access. As a result, Gogo Vision had more than 20 million views in 2016, double the prior year. We expect wireless entertainment views to continue to grow rapidly, driven by increased awareness of the service, additional content, integration with seatback screens and introduction of live television services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enable CAS. We expect that the demand by airlines for connectivity- based applications that improve the passenger experience and operational efficiency will increase significantly over the next several years. This trend will drive data usage on our network and a demand for platform services from Gogo. We are interfacing our equipment with the data buses on aircraft and are developing the hardware and software platforms that facilitate the development and deployment of applications. CAS currently supports route optimization, turbulence avoidance, electronic flight bag applications and real-time credit card processing and weather data.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Reduce Our Investment per Aircraft 
Our investment per aircraft is the installed cost of airborne equipment less the proceeds received from the airline. In 2016, we significantly reduced the installation cost per 2Ku aircraft by shortening the installation time from eight days to three days, and reduced equipment cost through engineering improvements and volume discounts. Furthermore, based on agreed-upon terms for our 2Ku awarded but uninstalled aircraft, proceeds from airlines as a percentage of 2Ku installation costs will increase from 2017 to 2018. In addition, our ability to leverage our growing portfolio of supplemental type certificates (STCs) will further reduce the cost of and time required to install new fleets. 
 Improve Margins 
We have made substantial investments in our network technologies, aircraft operations and platform in order to serve aircraft operators globally. As we leverage these investments by adding aircraft online and increasing revenue per aircraft, our margins will improve. For instance, in CA-ROW, we have purchased substantial global satellite capacity and invested in global sales, account management, aircraft engineering and certification, installation and maintenance capabilities. The growth of CA-ROW aircraft online will improve our margins per aircraft, per megabyte and overall by the end of 2018, but we will not see margin improvement in 2017 due to costs associated with the launch of new airlines in CA-ROW and OEM channel initiatives. For CA-NA, the improved ARPA from the additional bandwidth provided by 2Ku deployments is expected to improve margins beginning in 2018, with margin improvement from next generation ATG expected thereafter. 
 
7 
 
Contracts with Airline Partners 
 In CA, we enter into connectivity agreements with our airline partners under which the airlines commit to have our equipment installed on some or all of the aircraft they operate, and we commit to provide passenger connectivity and/or entertainment services, and in some circumstances CAS, on such aircraft. We have the exclusive right to provide Internet connectivity services on Gogo-installed aircraft throughout the term of the agreement in contracts with airline partners from which we derive a substantial majority of our CA revenue. The majority of our contracts with our airline partners have 10-year terms, with staggered expiration dates occurring on a fleet by fleet basis based on installation dates or on a contract basis, depending on the contract. Under our current contracts, the first expiration will occur in 2017 and the last in 2027 or later, depending on the timing of future installations. 
 Historically, our CA business has offered airline partners a turnkey model, under which we provide the airline with the full range of our services, charge the passenger for passenger connectivity or Gogo Vision services at prices we determine and remit to the airline a specified percentage of passenger revenue. Under such model, for satellite-based connectivity services, the airline typically pays Gogo a monthly fee for network monitoring and management services. We also offer and provide the airlines the option to adopt an airline-directed model, whereby the airline partner has flexibility to determine which of the many end-to-end services it wants Gogo to provide, which services it wants to provide itself and how it wishes to price the services provided to passengers. For example, an airline may elect to be the retailer for in-flight connectivity and entertainment services to its passengers, rather than using Gogo as the distributor. In such case, we will determine with the airline a fee structure that compensates us for the connectivity provided and the bandwidth consumed as well as any other services provided by Gogo. 
 Depending on the contract, installation and maintenance services may be performed by us and/or the airline. When we provide such services, under some agreements we include charges for installation and maintenance in our equipment pricing package; in other circumstances, the airline pays us directly for such services. In addition, under contracts with airline partners from which we derive a substantial majority of our CA revenue, we are obligated, subject to certain limitations, to upgrade or improve the ATG equipment installed on certain aircraft to ATG-4, and to obtain STCs, at our expense. Under certain contracts, we provide equipment credits or other incentives based on the number of aircraft installed with our equipment and the timing of such installations. Our contracts with airline partners set forth specified timelines for the installation or delivery of our airborne equipment, as well as service level commitments and our failure to meet such timelines or service level commitments, generally requires us to pay penalties or liquidated damages to the airlines and in certain circumstances may result in our airline partners being permitted to terminate all or a portion of the contract. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our CA BusinessA failure to maintain airline satisfaction with our equipment or the Gogo service could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. 
 As of December 31, 2016, under agreements with eight of our airline partners, the scope of the services included Gogo Vision and we are discussing with other airline partners the possibility of providing Gogo Vision on their installed fleets. We also provide under certain agreements content filtering and CAS, such as real-time credit card processing for passenger food and beverage purchases, flight crew access to real-time weather information, electronic flight bags and voice services in the cockpit. 
 Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines accounted for approximately 27% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have three contracts with Delta Air Lines. The contract for ATG service on Delta Air Lines mainline and regional jet fleets expires on the 13-year anniversary of specified installation milestones, which will occur in 2022 and 2025, respectively. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines for Ku-band satellite service on its international fleet and for 2Ku service expire in 2027. 
 Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by American Airlines (including legacy US Airways aircraft) accounted for approximately 23% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 
8 
 
 On February 24, 2017, we replaced our multiple contracts with American Airlines (including the contract originally entered into with US Airways) with one unified agreement (the Unified Agreement) covering aircraft installed or to be installed with our ATG and ATG-4 technologies and to be installed with our 2Ku technology. The Unified Agreement has different expiration dates for different fleet types. Generally, the term for each fleet type, other than those on which 2Ku will be installed, expires on the 10-year anniversary of the date on which 90% of such fleet type has been installed with our ATG equipment, or when the fleet types are retired or deinstalled, with the first expiration date occurring in 2019 and the last in 2025. The Unified Agreement will expire with respect to the 2Ku-installed fleet in 2019. 
 Each of our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines provides for early termination by the airline in specified circumstances and allows the airline to terminate the contract should the percentage of passengers using the Gogo service on the airlines flights not meet certain thresholds. We currently experience, and for the last five years have experienced, connectivity take rates in excess of those thresholds. In addition, under the Unified Agreement, American Airlines has the right at any time to terminate Gogo service on approximately 550 mainline aircraft on which our ATG service is currently provided, and we currently expect such aircraft to be deinstalled over the next several years. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit these airlines to terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of other certain contractually stipulated events, including our failure to meet service level requirements and the circumstance in which another company provides an alternate connectivity service that is a material improvement over our passenger connectivity service, such that failing to adopt such service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our CA BusinessWe are dependent on agreements with our airline partners to be able to access the passengers. Payments for our passenger services have provided, and we expect will continue to provide, a significant portion of our revenue. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from these agreements on a timely basis or to renew any existing agreements upon expiration or termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our CA BusinessIf we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our ability to maintain sufficient network capacity and our business could be materially and adversely affected and Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our CA BusinessA failure to maintain airline satisfaction with our equipment or the Gogo service could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. Our contracts with these airlines also permit the airline to terminate the agreement with respect to certain fleets on specified dates, subject to payment of a specified termination fee. If our contracts with Delta Air Lines or American Airlines were to be terminated in whole or in significant part for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 No other contract accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 Installation and Maintenance 
 We have two assembly facilities and have fostered installation and maintenance relationships to provide quality service in our product offerings. Our CA and BA assembly, installation and maintenance activities take place at FAA-certified production facilities in Bensenville, Illinois and Broomfield, Colorado, respectively. The facilities are FAA-certificated repair stations and are operating in accordance with FAA-issued ratings and quality control systems, pursuant to FAA regulations. The repair stations authorized activities include receiving, inspecting, equipment and system testing, kitting, warehousing and completion of regulatory shipping documentation. We work with our airline partners and third-party vendors to install and maintain our equipment on aircraft. Some of our airline partners choose to use their own mechanics to provide installation and maintenance services, in which case we provide training and on-site installation support and logistics. Other airlines look to us for these services as all of our installation and maintenance vendors meet the certification requirements established by the airlines and the FAA.

Technology Infrastructure 
 Our proprietary ATG and satellite networks and technology platforms, consisting of both hardware and software in the aircraft and on the ground, have been designed and developed to create highly compelling user experiences and enable future domestic and international service and product growth, while managing the bandwidth and regulatory constraints associated with in-flight media and content delivery. We have developed sophisticated custom software and hardware that optimizes the air-to-ground link (direct air-to-ground and satellite-based) and traffic through the ability to monitor end-to-end network performance from the ground. Our network and systems architecture was designed to evolve with best of breed technologies and enable us to employ new technological innovations across our own ATG network and third-party satellite networks using Ku-band satellite service. 
 Our expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $45.9 million, $50.1 million and $40.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Our ATG Network 
 In 2006, we acquired through an FCC auction, an exclusive nationwide license for 3 MHz ATG spectrum operating in the 800 MHz band (the ATG License), which is the only licensed broadband spectrum reserved for ATG services. In the second quarter of 2013, we consummated the acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC (Airfone), through which we acquired the FCC license for 1 MHz of ATG spectrum (1 MHz ATG License) held by LiveTV, LLC (LiveTV). In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary the exclusive rights to use Canadian ATG spectrum for which SkySurf is the primary licensee (the License Agreement). The License Agreement has an initial term of ten years and is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. 
 We have coverage over the contiguous United States and portions of Alaska and Canada. As of December 31, 2016, our ATG network consisted of approximately 250 cell sites. In 2018, we expect to start upgrading the ATG network to provide our next generation ATG services, and we expect to add more cell sites over the next several years to maintain efficient delivery of our growing mobile broadband services. These sites are connected to our data centers, which are in turn connected to the Internet. This connectivity is provided by a state-of-the-art Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and a flexible and scalable IP-based infrastructure. The cell sites are connected to the MPLS network using fiber-optics (Ethernet & DS3), microwave where required or copper (T1). 
 In order to increase bandwidth speeds and provide additional capacity in North America, we recently announced development of our next generation ATG network, which will employ 60MHz of unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band and provide peak speeds to the aircraft above 100 Mbps. This network will utilize LTE technology and coexist with and leverage our existing ATG network and spectrum. We expect this new technology to be available beginning in 2018 and to be targeted primarily at larger business aviation aircraft and smaller commercial aircraft in North America. 
 Our Satellite Networks 
 We provide near-global Ku-band satellite service using transponder capacity from our satellite providers. Our first generation Ku service was commercially launched in 2013, and we announced 2Ku, our latest generation satellite service in 2014. We obtained our first 2Ku STC in late 2015, and 2Ku became commercially available to passengers in 2016. 2Ku employs two low-profile, highly efficient satellite antennas (one for transmission to the aircraft and the other for transmission from the aircraft) that provide twice the spectral efficiency of our Ku service and significantly improve coverage in equatorial regions and results in less drag and fuel burn as compared to other satellite alternatives. Our 2Ku satellite antennas can be used in conjunction with all Ku-band satellites in operation today and are designed to be compatible with HTS as they come online beginning in 2017 and with LEO satellites expected at a later time. 
 
10 
 
Our Iridium service is supported by a network of 66 Iridium satellites. In addition, we launched SBB service in 2014, which is supported by three geostationary (Inmarsat I-4) satellites. Our high bandwidth offering of Global Xpress Jet ConneX became operational in 2016 and is supported by three satellites. 
 Our Airborne Network 
 Our airborne equipment includes core module components (including an onboard server, or ACPU, wireless access points, or WAP, and optionally a content loading device, or CLD, and handsets for cockpit/crew use) and technology-specific communication components (including a modem, amplifier, antenna and radome). We leverage standard technology and components in our system where available and design our system by selecting, assembling and packaging components that can withstand temperature, pressure and vibration on aircraft in-flight. Passengers connect to our service through our in-cabin Wi-Fi network. We are continuing to innovate and develop advanced technologies for storage, processing and connectivity for the in-cabin network. 
 Our customized airborne network allows us to manage data traffic in real time in order to mitigate capacity constraints through sophisticated bandwidth management and to place cached entertainment and other content directly on airborne network servers, both of which increase the speed and quality of our service. 
 Our Ground Network (Data Centers and Network Operations Center (NOC)) 
 Our data centers, which service our ATG and satellite technologies, provide redundant telecommunications connections to the Internet and contain numerous servers associated with hosting our in-flight and ground portals and the network nodes that enable the rich set of features offered through the Gogo platform. Additionally, we have started to offload portions of our network to cloud-based services. Most of the data center nodes are common across our ATG and satellite technologies, while some nodes are technology specific. 
 The NOC, located in our Chicago, Illinois facility, serves as the central location that monitors daily network operation, conducts network diagnostics and coordinates responses to any performance issues on the ground or in the air. The NOC provides 24 hours a day, 365 days a year management and surveillance of network performance and activities through the use of network management and reporting systems. These systems interface with all network elements and have the ability to monitor the connection and status of all our equipped aircraft in-flight, regardless of the technology used to provide in-flight connectivity. 
 Competition 
 Commercial Aviation 
 Our key competitors include Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Inmarsat, OnAir, Panasonic Avionics Corp., Rockwell Collins/ARINC, Thales/LiveTV, ViaSat and Zodiac Inflight Innovations, all of which provide different technologies and strategies to provide in-flight connectivity and/or entertainment. We believe we are the only telecommunications company focused exclusively on global aviation and its unique connectivity requirements. We believe the key differentiating factors between us and our competitors include: technology solutions, geographical coverage, operational excellence, and service models offered to airlines. The strategic priorities, offerings and capabilities of our competitors vary, including the variety of technologies available for various aircraft types, the ability to offer in-flight Internet solutions as well as entertainment offerings such as live television and traditional hard-wired in-flight entertainment systems, the ability to cost-effectively provide offerings on a global basis, the ability to manage capacity constraints, and the ability to offer, incorporate and manage new in-flight connectivity technologies and solutions as they become available. 
 Business Aviation 
 Gogo is the only equipment and service provider of three networks: ATG, SBB and Iridium. We compete against both equipment and telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including, 
 
11 
 
 Honeywell Aerospace, Rockwell Collins, Satcom Direct and ViaSat. Also, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Panasonic Avionics Corp. and SmartSky Networks all recently announced that they intend to enter the business aviation market. 
 Licenses and Regulation 
 Federal Aviation Administration 
 The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. We regularly obtain STCs for each aircraft type operated by each airline partner on whose aircraft our equipment will be installed and separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different airlines. 
 After obtaining an STC, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturing Authority, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facilitys production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. 
 Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a No Hazard Determination for our cell sites which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites we may first be required to obtain such a determination. 
 Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. 
 In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. 
 Foreign Aviation Regulation 
 According to international aviation convention, the airworthiness of FAA-certified Gogo equipment installed on U.S.-registered aircraft is recognized by civil aviation authorities (CAAs) worldwide. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. 
 
12 
 
The FAA holds bilateral agreements with a number of certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (BAA) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness (IPA) provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircrafts country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate (VSTC). For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each airline partners service in any country in which they register aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on our airline partners fleet. 
 U.S. Department of Transportation 
 The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transport to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including in-flight entertainment (IFE) and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee recently issued a resolution which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. Since a final rule on IFE has not been issued, however, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. 
 Federal Communications Commission 
 Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless operations. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCCs prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. 
 Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, our BA business provides some of its voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, our BA segment provides an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. 
 We offer connectivity service in the United States to commercial and business aviation aircraft through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license that operates in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See ATG License Terms and Conditions. 
 Previously, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services were classified as information services, and not as telecommunications services. Therefore, these services were not subject to FCC common carrier regulation. However, effective June 12, 2015, the FCC reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services in an order released March 12, 2015 (Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order also adopted broad new net neutrality rules. For example, covered broadband providers may not block access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. Broadband providers also may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. In addition, broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other 
 
13 
 
 lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind, and they may not prioritize the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contain an exception for reasonable network management. The Open Internet Order recognizes that whether a network management practice is reasonable varies according to the broadband technology involved, and we believe provides more flexibility to implement network management practices in the context of Gogos capacity-constrained air-to-ground and satellite broadband networks. 
 The FCC order also imposes new disclosure requirements on broadband providers, including more granular network performance reporting requirements. The FCC temporarily exempted smaller providers, such as Gogo, from its enhanced disclosure requirements. The exemption was recently extended until February 2022. 
 Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCCs data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (CMDS) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft, and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be commercially reasonable. The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. The Open Internet Order did not alter Gogos obligations with respect to data roaming, but the FCC has committed to revisiting data roaming rules in the future. 
 In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible by persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision service. 
 In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold other FCC licenses, including microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network, two fixed satellite earth station licenses used for network testing and support, one experimental license used for testing equipment, two aircraft radio licenses, an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the U.S. and foreign points, and a non-exclusive license at 3650 MHz, which currently does not authorize operational use and would require registration with the FCC of transmitter site locations prior to commencing use. We also hold a license for blanket authority to operate Ku-band satellite transceivers on up to 2,000 aircraft, which allows us to provide domestic and international broadband service (although some countries require additional authorizations of their own). 
 ATG License Terms and Conditions 
 The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide substantial service to aircraft and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. 
 Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no substantial service obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was recently granted for an additional 10-year term. 
 Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. 
 A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a similar agreement between the U.S. and Mexico is in the process of being negotiated. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee. In 2012, we entered into the License 
 
14 
 
 Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The renewal of the primary spectrum license will depend upon the satisfaction by Gogo and SkySurf of certain conditions set forth in the license, including, without limitation, a network build-out requirement which has been met. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness and renewal of the primary spectrum license, issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf on June 30, 2009, which expires on June 29, 2019. 
 Prior to spectrum coordination with the ATG licensee in Mexico, the coordination agreement could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels, and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Once a provider of air-to-ground services is licensed in Mexico, we hope to negotiate an arrangement that will provide seamless connectivity on flights between Mexico and the U.S. 
 Equipment Certification 
 We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of CA or BA services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCCs technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. 
 Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations 
 As noted above, the Open Internet Order reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services. Certain statutory provisions of Title II now apply to these broadband Internet access services, including provisions that impose consumer privacy protections such as Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) requirements. Following that issuance of that order, the FCC conducted a separate rulemaking proceeding to update its CPNI rules, and on October 27, 2016, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules for broadband Internet access service providers and for voice providers, such as BA, which were already subject to the older CPNI rules. The new rules govern, among other things, the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information and customer proprietary information, notice and consent practices, cybersecurity, and data breach notifications. A portion of the privacy rules became effective on January 3, 2017, and we believe we are in compliance with these rules and obligations to the extent they are applicable. Other portions of the new rules are scheduled to become effective later this year. The data security obligations are scheduled to become effective March 2, 2017, although the FCC has announced plans to stay the effectiveness of at least some of these obligations. The data breach-notification requirements will become effective the later of Executive Branch approval or June 2, 2017; and the notice and customer approval provisions will become effective on the later of Executive Branch approval or December 4, 2017. However, these rules are subject to possible revisions that could result from the consideration of various pending petitions for reconsideration of the rules. As currently written, the new privacy and data security rules are expected to increase our compliance obligations in certain respects, and we are currently evaluating what, if any, specific effect they may have on our operations. 
 We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Although the FTCs authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been clearly delineated, FTC officials have publicly stated that they view the FTC as having jurisdiction over Internet service providers non-common carrier services. Some of our services are subject to the FTCs jurisdiction. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that, inter alia: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the companys actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. 
 
15 
 
We collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information is intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website, applicable law and our contractual obligations to airlines, BA customers and other third parties, as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to state mini-FTC Acts, which also prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. 
 While we have implemented reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information, cyber-attacks on companies have increased in frequency and potential impact in recent years and may be successful despite reasonable precautions and result in substantial potential liabilities. 
 As we expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On April 27, 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), scheduled to take effect on May 25, 2018, which may result in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the European Union impose restrictions on transferring data to countries that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. The United States is a jurisdiction whose processes these countries do not deem adequate for purposes of cross-border personal data transfers. 
 Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and European Union member state laws that permit the cross border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Gogo has entered into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union and Switzerland to legitimize these transfers. There is a risk that these standard contractual clauses may be invalidated by the Court of Justice for the European Union as a lawful data transfer mechanism on the grounds that they do not provide adequate protection of European data subjects personally identifiable information. There is also a risk that EU data protection authorities may investigate or bring enforcement actions with criminal and administrative sanctions. Such actions could also damage our business and harm our reputation. 
 Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection 
 The FCCs Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based BA services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. 
CALEA 
 The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service 
 
16 
 
 providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. Our network has been confirmed as compliant with CALEA by a third-party tester as of May 18, 2011. 
 Foreign Government Approvals 
 In connection with our satellite service, we have implemented a process for obtaining any required authority needed to provide our service over the airspace of foreign countries, or verifying that no additional authorization is needed. Each country over which a Gogo-equipped aircraft flies has the right to limit, regulate (e.g., through a licensing regime) or prohibit the offering of our service. We may not be able to obtain the necessary authority for every country over which a partner airline flies. For some countries, we have not been and do not expect to be able to obtain a definitive answer regarding their potential regulation of our service, and we may incur some regulatory risk by operating over the airspace of these countries. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements could result in penalties being imposed on Gogo and/or on its airline partners, allow airline partners affected by such requirements to terminate their contracts with us prior to expiration or, under a contract with one of our airline partners, require us to pay liquidated damages. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and Regulation. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Moreover, even countries that have previously provided clearance for our service have the right to change their regulations at any time. 
Seasonality 
 The demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect our overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. 
 We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we held United States patents expiring on dates ranging from February 2019 to January 2035, and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from August 2017 to November 2034. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. 
 We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, Gogo, Gogo Biz and Gogo Vision, although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. 
 We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would 
 
17 
 
 be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for aircards, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for aircards, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements as well as certain licenses to commercially available software are material to our business. 
 We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and airline partners. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,183 employees, including 358 in product and engineering, 533 in network operations, 117 in sales and marketing, and 175 in general and administrative. Of such employees, 257 are employed in our BA operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
