ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an early-stage blank check company incorporated in February 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our “initial business combination.”
Recent Events
 
On March 5, 2021, our sponsor acquired 100 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $250.00 per share. On March 15, 2021, we effected a 64,687.5-for-one forward stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reclassified those issued and outstanding shares into shares of Class B common stock. On June 21, 2021, we effected an approximately 1.11-for-one forward stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock. On October 26, 2021, we effected an approximately one-for-1.11 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock. At the time of our IPO, the sponsor held 6,468,750 founder shares (reflecting an aggregate capital contribution of approximately $0.004 per share). The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon completion of the IPO. On November 19, 2021, our sponsor transferred 20,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors at their original purchase price. In addition, at the closing of our initial business combination, our anchor investor will be entitled to purchase from our sponsor an aggregate of 12.5% of the number of founder shares outstanding upon the final closing of the IPO, at a purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share.
 
On November 19, 2021, we completed our IPO of 25,875,000 units, including 3,375,000 units purchased by the underwriter pursuant to the over-allotment option granted by the Company to the underwriter. Each “Unit” consists of one share Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Public Warrant”), with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $258,750,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,350,000 shares of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to our sponsor, the anchor investor and the underwriter at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $12,350,000.
 
A total of $263,925,000, comprised of $253,575,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,056,250 of the underwriter’s deferred fee) and $10,350,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
On January 7, 2022, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade on Nasdaq the Class A common stock and Public warrants included in the units under the symbols “LFAC” and “LFACW,” respectively. Those units not separated will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “LFACU” and each of the shares of Class A common stock and warrants that are separated will trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “LFAC” and “LFACW,” respectively.

Our Business Model
 
Although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management and board to identify and acquire a business with a disruptive business model that may provide opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns in the financial technology or services, technology, digital asset or consumer sectors. We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that their contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, and investment bankers will enable us to pursue an attractive set of opportunities. Our management team believes that its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives will remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy.
 
Our management team’s objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and create value for our stockholders by applying a disciplined strategy of underwriting intrinsic worth and partnering with management to build long-term stockholder value. Our management team intends to apply a disciplined approach which will focus on (i) large addressable market opportunities; (ii) attractive business models with strong competitive advantages; (iii) businesses with significant opportunities for growth; and (iv) capable management teams looking for a value-added partner. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Our management team has an in-depth understanding of high growth business opportunities where we believe technology is creating disruption, and the ability to leverage technology to increase stockholder value.
 
Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing attractive investments across a number of sectors, including financial technology, a sector that is a focus for us, which we believe presents an opportunity to take advantage of the intersection of technology, process improvements and business model innovations. In addition, our team has significant hands-on experience working with private companies in preparing for and executing an initial public offering and serving as active owners and directors post-public offering by working closely with these companies to continue their transformations and help create value in the public markets.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company with a disruptive business model that could benefit from a hands-on owner with extensive operational experience in the financial technology or services, technology, digital asset or consumer sectors that complements the experience of our management team and board of directors and can benefit from their extensive knowledge of these sectors. Our acquisition strategy will leverage our management team’s network of proprietary transaction sources where we believe a combination of the relationships, knowledge and experience of our management and board members could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or properties to improve their overall value proposition.
 
Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team’s extensive experience in both investing in a wide variety of industries and business situations. We expect these networks will provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be sourced from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Members of our management team are communicating with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies or assets that we believe:

● | can utilize the extensive networks and insights we have built in the financial technology or services, technology, digital asset or consumer sectors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been incorrectly valued by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders. We will seek to acquire the target on terms and in a manner that leverages our management team’s experience in investing within the financial technology or services, technology, digital asset or consumer sectors. Potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is in good standing with any applicable regulatory authorities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet some or all of the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
Initial Business Combination 
 
The Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, based upon its assessment of the target, including, but not limited to, the target’s assets, operating results, and prospects. In connection with our board of directors’ determination as to its opinion of the fair market value of the target business, our board of directors may, in its discretion, seek the analyses and advice of third parties on which the board may rely, including seeking to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the fair market value of business combinations. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such advice or opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such advice or opinion. We can offer no assurance our board of directors will seek such advice or opinion in connection with our initial business combination, or will be able to obtain such advice or opinion if desired. Additionally, pursuant to the Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We may raise additional proceeds to complete an acquisition opportunity by making a specified future issuance. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B common stock, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of the IPO plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of our Class B common stock agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B common stock at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B common stock, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A common stock. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our common stock.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will comply with any applicable regulatory requirements and own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in an initial business combination transaction.
 
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses, and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review including, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us (including any relevant and applicable regulatory filings). We cannot currently ascertain the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process. Any costs incurred with respect to prospective target businesses with which we do not ultimately complete an initial business combination will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with such persons, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.

Members of our management team and our independent directors own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our executive officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such executive officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. Each of our executive officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity or is subject to other contractual restrictions. Accordingly, if any of our executive officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which they have then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such executive officer’s or director’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law, they will need to honor their fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. We do not expect, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or executive officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in their capacity as a director or executive officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
Status as a Public Company 
 
We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting fees, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, after a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
Although we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250.0 million as of the prior June 30th and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th.
 
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 1909 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75201, and our telephone number is (214) 740-6105. We pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 1909 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75201 or on our website, www.lfcapital.co.
