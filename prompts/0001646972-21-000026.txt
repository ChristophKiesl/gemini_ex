Item 1 - Business
Overview
Albertsons is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States, with both strong local presence and national scale. We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our stores. We maintain a website (www.AlbertsonsCompanies.com) that includes additional information about the Company. We make available through our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Retail Operations
As of February 27, 2021, we operated 2,277 stores across 34 states and the District of Columbia under more than 20 well known banners including Albertsons, Safeway, Vons, Pavilions, Randalls, Tom Thumb, Carrs, Jewel-Osco, Acme, Shaw's, Star Market, United Supermarkets, Market Street, Haggen, Kings Food Markets and Balducci's Food Lovers Market. Additionally, as of February 27, 2021, we operated 1,727 pharmacies, 1,313 in-store branded coffee shops, 400 adjacent fuel centers, 22 dedicated distribution centers, 20 manufacturing facilities and various digital platforms. Our stores operate in First-and-Main retail locations and have leading market share within attractive and growing geographies. We hold a #1 or #2 position by market share in 67% of the 121 metropolitan statistical areas ("MSAs") in which we operate. Our portfolio of well-located, full-service stores provides the foundation of our omni-channel platform, and we have continued to enhance our capabilities to meet customer demand for convenience and flexibility. Our rapidly growing Drive Up & Go curbside pickup service is currently available in approximately 1,420 locations. In addition to our long-established home delivery network, we also collaborate with third parties, including Instacart for rush delivery as well as DoorDash for delivery of our prepared and ready-to-eat offerings. We now offer home delivery services across more than 2,000 of our stores and 12 of the country's top 15 MSAs by population. We seek to tailor our offerings to local demographics and preferences of the markets in which we operate. Our Locally Great, Nationally Strong operating structure empowers decision making at the local level, which we believe better serves our customers and communities, while also providing the systems, analytics and buying power afforded by an organization with national scale.
Segments
We are engaged in the operation of food and drug retail stores that offer grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services. Our retail operating divisions are geographically based, have similar economic characteristics and similar expected long-term financial performance. Our operating segments and reporting units are made up of 12 divisions, which are reported in one reportable segment. Each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Across all operating segments, the Company operates primarily one store format. Each division offers, through its stores and digital channels, the same general mix of products with similar pricing to similar categories of customers, have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments and purchase merchandise from similar or the same vendors. 
Products
Our stores offer grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services. We are not dependent on any individual supplier; only one third-party supplier represented more than 5% of our sales for fiscal 2020.
Merchandising and Manufacturing
We offer more than 13,000 high-quality products under our Own Brands portfolio. Our Own Brands products resonate well with our shoppers, as evidenced by Own Brands sales of over $14.8 billion in fiscal 2020, an increase of over 13% compared to fiscal 2019. 
Own Brands continues to deliver on innovation with more than 1,200 new items launched in fiscal 2020 and plans to launch approximately 800 new Own Brands items annually over the next few years. For example, innovation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 included the launch of new items ranging from pickles in Open Nature, herbs and spices in O Organics, family packs in frozen fruits and vegetables helping to stretch the family budget, and specialty olives in Signature Reserve. Our plant based portfolio expanded to 56 items with $37.6 million in sales in fiscal 2020. We are excited about our O Organics and Open Nature brands, which posted a combined 15.1% growth in sales year-over-year, with over 2,000 items, and we plan to introduce approximately 100 new items for these brands in fiscal 2021. In addition to new item innovation and brand development, Own Brands continues to focus on package redesign to refresh shelf presence and comply with new regulatory nutrition guideline changes.
As measured by units for fiscal 2020, 10.4% of our Own Brands merchandise was manufactured in Company-owned facilities, and the remainder of our Own Brands merchandise was purchased from third parties. We closely monitor make-versus-buy decisions on internally sourced products to optimize their quality and profitability. In addition, we believe that our scale will provide opportunities to leverage our fixed manufacturing costs in order to drive innovation across our Own Brands portfolio. As of February 27, 2021, we operated 20 food production plants. These plants consisted of seven milk plants, four soft drink bottling plants, three bakery plants, two ice cream product plants, two grocery/prepared food plants, one ice plant and one soup plant. 
Distribution
As of February 27, 2021, we operated 22 strategically located distribution centers, approximately 36% of which are owned or ground-leased. Our distribution centers collectively provide approximately 66% of all products to our retail operating areas.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing efforts involve collaboration between our national marketing and merchandising team and local divisions and stores. We augment the local division teams with corporate resources and are focused on providing expertise, sharing best practices and leveraging scale in partnership with leading consumer packaged goods vendors. Our corporate teams support divisions by providing strategic guidance in order to drive key areas of our business, including pharmacy, general merchandise and our Own Brands. Our local marketing teams set brand strategy and communicate brand messages through our integrated digital and physical marketing and advertising channels. We operate in 121 MSAs and are ranked #1 or #2 by market share in 67% of these markets. We maintain price competitiveness through systematic, selective and thoughtful price investment to drive customer traffic and basket size. We also use our just for U loyalty program, including both personalized deals and digital coupons, as well as gas and grocery rewards, to target promotional activity and improve our customers' experience. We have 25.4 million households currently enrolled in our loyalty program. We have achieved significant success with active participants in our just for U program, which drives higher sales and customer retention. We have recently deployed and are continuing to refine cloud-based enterprise solutions to quickly process proprietary customer, product and transaction data and efficiently provide our local managers with targeted marketing strategies for customers in their communities. By leveraging customer and transaction information with data driven analytics, our "personalized deal engine" is able to select, out of the thousands of different promotions offered by our suppliers, the offers that we expect will be most compelling to each of our more than 30 million weekly customers. In addition, we use data analytics to optimize shelf assortment and space in our stores by continually and systematically reviewing the performance of each product.
Raw Materials
Various agricultural commodities constitute the principal raw materials used by us in the manufacture of our food products. We believe that raw materials for our products are not in short supply, and all are readily available from a wide variety of independent suppliers.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws, including those relating to waste management, air emissions and underground storage tanks. In addition, as an owner and operator of commercial real estate, we may be subject to liability under applicable environmental laws for clean-up of contamination at our facilities. Compliance with, and clean-up liability under, these laws has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, liquidity or operating results.
We work hard to maintain the highest standards of environmental stewardship (including sustainably sourced products). As our most recent sustainability report shows, we recycled more than 25 million pounds of plastic film and 780 million pounds of cardboard from our operations and completed over 1,400 energy efficiency projects across 475 facilities. Moreover, 100% of our Own Brands Waterfront BISTRO and Open Nature seafood is sourced to meet our Responsible Seafood Policy, achieving our commitment three years ahead of our 2022 goal.
Human Capital
As of February 27, 2021, Albertsons Companies, Inc. employed approximately 300,000 full- and part-time associates who serve our more than 30 million weekly customers. We recognize that our associates are a key component of delighting our customers. As such, we are proud to offer them myriad opportunities to grow and advance their careers. For example, we provide our associates with training and development opportunities through on-the-job training, mentoring programs, eLearning and classroom-style learning. We have also partnered with industry associations to provide access to relevant continuing retail education opportunities through colleges around the country. Over the last year our associates from the front lines to our offices completed over six million hours of training through various programs. In fiscal 2020, more than 60,000 of our associates celebrated at least 15 years of service, and more than 43,000 of them celebrated over 20 years of service.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to advancing diversity and inclusion by helping ensure that everyone — customers, associates, people in the neighborhoods in which we operate and business partners — are treated with courtesy, dignity and respect and have equal access to resources, products, and opportunities to succeed. 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion and thoughtful people practices is a core element of our philosophy, ensuring our associates in our stores, offices, distribution centers and other operations reflect the diverse communities we serve. We believe in a diverse and inclusive workplace that fosters personal growth, develops talent and harnesses the power of different and unique perspectives. We recognize and appreciate the variety of backgrounds and characteristics that make individuals unique, while providing a work environment that promotes and celebrates individual and collective achievement.
We believe that diverse perspectives strengthen and enrich our stores, our Company and our society. Diversity and inclusion are components of our programs for recruitment, development and training of associates and leaders. We provide opportunities for each person in our company to contribute their ideas, talents and enthusiasm to our success. Associates can participate in various associate resource and network groups, such as the Women’s 
Inspiration and Inclusion Network ("WIIN"), the Hispanic Leadership Network, the Asian Network, the African American Leadership Council, and the Albertsons Pride Alliance. 
We support equal employment opportunity in hiring, development and advancement for all qualified persons without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or any other status protected by law. We provide reasonable accommodations for applicants and associates with disabilities. We will not tolerate unlawful discrimination in any aspect of employment, nor will we tolerate harassment of any individual or group on the basis of any protected characteristic. Over the past few years, more than 241,000 associates have completed Diversity and Inclusion Training.
Cultural Principles
As a company, our purpose is to bring happiness and well-being to families and communities, because life happens around food. To achieve our purpose, we focus on a set of six fundamental values:
•Inclusivity: We always value everyone's perspective.
•Compassion: We always treat each other and our customers with kindness and respect.
•Teamwork: We always support and recognize each other.
•Competition: We always act with integrity to win over the customer.
•Learning: We always strive to grow and develop ourselves and others.
•Ownership: We always take actions to drive our success.
Total Rewards
We offer health and wellness benefits to keep our associates at their best along with a competitive compensation package. This includes comprehensive wages and benefits to meet the varying needs of our associates and their families. Our benefit programs include health care insurance, dental, vision, life, disability and other forms of insurance benefits, paid time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, associate assistance programs and 401(k) plans among many others, based on eligibility. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided enhanced hourly pay, including bonuses to frontline associates and paid time off to associates who tested positive or were quarantined due to exposure, resulting in more than $400 million in additional compensation.
Labor Relations
As of February 27, 2021, approximately 210,000 of our 300,000 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. During fiscal 2020, collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 27,000 employees were renegotiated. Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 67,000 employees have expired or are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2021. We have sought to actively manage our participation in multiemployer pension plans through active negotiations with union officials, pension plan trustees, other contributing employers and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") in order to best provide our employees fair wages, comprehensive retirement packages and other benefits.
Community
Throughout the nation, in the neighborhoods served by our stores, the passion of our employees and the generosity of our customers serve as the backbone of our history of giving back to these communities. It is the foundation of our business. We champion giving back, and we are proud that our associates and our Company contribute funds, talent and time to the causes that are important in the many communities in which we operate.
As a grocer, no greater cause hits closer to home for us than hunger relief. Each year, we donate millions of pounds of food to food banks, pantries and other agencies that are on the front lines in the fight against hunger in America through Nourishing Neighbors. Our 2,277 stores support hunger relief efforts and other community causes through fundraising campaigns in conjunction with the Albertsons Companies Foundation, our nonprofit.
The Albertsons Companies Foundation supports causes that impact our customers' lives. Our stores provide the opportunity to mobilize funding and create awareness in our neighborhoods through our employees' passion, partnerships with our vendors and the generous contributions by our customers.
Overall, as a company, we work in collaboration with thousands of local organizations and seek to improve the quality of life in the communities we serve. We take pride in ensuring that most of the funds we raise stay in local communities and reflect what is important to our employees and customers.
During fiscal 2020, along with the Albertsons Companies Foundation, we gave $260 million in food and financial support, including $94 million through our Nourishing Neighbors Program to ensure those living in the communities in which we operate have enough to eat. In addition, 65,000 people were connected with SNAP benefits through our funding. We also made a $5 million commitment to organizations supporting social justice, including the National Urban League and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. These efforts have helped millions of people in the areas of hunger relief, education, cancer research and treatment, social justice and programs for people with disabilities and veterans' outreach.
We are proud of who we are, the products we offer and the people we have the pleasure of serving every day. We will continue to do the right thing, for the right reasons, and hold ourselves accountable.

Seasonality
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature, but a larger share of annual revenues may be generated in November and December due to the major holidays.
Competitive Environment
The food and drug retail industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors that affect our business are location, quality, price, service, selection, convenience and condition of assets such as our stores. The operating environment for the food and drug retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense competition, aggressive expansion, increasing specialization of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and consolidation.
We face intense competition from other food and/or drug retailers, supercenters, club stores, online retailers, specialty and niche supermarkets, "limited assortment" stores, drug stores, general merchandisers, wholesale stores, discount stores, convenience stores, natural food stores, farmers' markets, local chains and stand-alone stores that cater to the individual cultural preferences of specific neighborhoods, restaurants and a growing number of internet-based home delivery and meal solution companies. We and our competitors engage in price and non-price competition which, from time to time, has adversely affected our operating margins. Our competition includes, but is not limited to, traditional and specialty supermarkets, natural and organic food stores, general merchandise supercenters, membership clubs, online retailers, home delivery companies, meal kit services and pharmacies. Our competitive position depends on successfully competing on product quality and selection, store quality, shopping experience, customer service, convenience and price.
