ITEM 1  Business 
 Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois in December 1927, as successor to the business of Chicago Rivet & Specialty Co. The Company operates in two segments of the fastener industry: fasteners and assembly equipment. The fastener segment consists of the manufacture and sale of rivets, cold-formed fasteners and parts and screw machine products. The assembly equipment segment consists primarily of the manufacture of automatic rivet setting machines, automatic assembly equipment and parts and tools for such machines. For further discussion regarding the Companys operations and segments, see Note 6 of the financial statements which appears on page 10 of the Companys 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders. The 2016 Annual Report is filed as an exhibit to this report. 
 The principal market for the Companys products is the North American automotive industry. Sales are solicited by employees and by independent sales representatives. 
 The segments in which the Company operates are characterized by active and substantial competition. No single company dominates the industry. The Companys competitors include both larger and smaller manufacturers, and segments or divisions of large, diversified companies with substantial financial resources. Principal competitive factors in the market for the Companys products are price, quality and service. 
 The Company serves a variety of customers. Revenues are primarily derived from sales to customers involved, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture of automobiles and automotive components. Information concerning backlog of orders is not considered material to the understanding of the Companys business due to relatively short production cycles. The level of business activity for the Company is closely related to the overall level of industrial activity in the United States. During 2016, sales to two customers exceeded 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues. Sales to TI Group Automotive Systems, LLC accounted for approximately 19% and 21% of the Companys consolidated revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to Fisher & Company accounted for approximately 12% of the Companys consolidated revenues in 2016 and 2015. 
 The Companys business has historically been stronger during the first half of the year. 
 The Company purchases raw material from a number of sources, primarily within the United States. There are numerous sources of raw material, and the Company does not have to rely on a single source for any of its requirements. 
 Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not of significant importance to the business of the Company. 
 The Company does not engage in significant research activities, but rather in ongoing product improvement and development. The amounts spent on product development activities in the last two years were not material. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company employed 231 people. 
 The Company has no foreign operations. Sales to foreign customers represent approximately 12% of the Companys total sales.
