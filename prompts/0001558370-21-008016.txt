Item 1.    Business
Overview
For many years we have developed and marketed high performance memory products, including “Very Fast” static random access memory, or SRAM, that are incorporated primarily in high-performance networking and telecommunications equipment, such as routers, switches, wide area network infrastructure equipment, wireless base stations and network access equipment. We sell these products to leading original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers including Nokia.  In addition, we serve the ongoing needs of the military, aerospace, industrial, test and measurement equipment, automotive and medical markets for high-performance SRAMs. Based on the performance characteristics of our products and the breadth of our product portfolio, we consider ourselves to be a leading provider of Very Fast SRAMs. We utilize a fabless business model, which allows us both to focus our resources on research and development, product design and marketing, and to gain access to advanced process technologies with only modest capital investment and fixed costs.
Beginning in November 2015 with the acquisition of an Israeli company, our principal strategic objective has been the development of in-place associative computing solutions for applications in evolving new markets such as “big data” (including machine learning and deep convolutional neural networks (“CNNs”)), natural language processing, computer vision, and cyber security. Our commercialization efforts for our initial Associative Processing Unit (“APU”) products are focused on applications using similarity search. Similarity search is used in visual search queries for ecommerce and molecular structure similarity search applications for drug and vaccine discovery. Our extensive experience in developing high speed synchronous SRAMs enhances our ability to develop hardware artificial intelligence (AI) products and solutions with long term reliability. Even as we develop in-place associative computing solutions, we continue to be committed to the synchronous SRAM market, supplying both exceedingly high densities not available elsewhere, and robust high-quality radiation-tolerant and radiation-hardened space grade parts.
We were incorporated in California in 1995 under the name Giga Semiconductor, Inc. We changed our name to GSI Technology in December 2003 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 2004 under the name GSI Technology, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 1213 Elko Drive, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, and our telephone number is (408) 331-8800.

Industry and Market Background
Associative Processing Unit Computing Markets
With the vast amount of data currently being generated and the demand for faster processing of that data, processor speeds are continuing to increase. However, existing systems that move data back and forth between the processor and memory are not able to provide the fast response times required by real time “big data” applications. Faster response times are also needed to meet the demands of developers in such markets as cyber security and computer vision. For example, in the automotive market, advanced driver assistance systems require a tremendous amount of image processing to be accomplished in real time. 
Our commercialization efforts for the APU product are initially focused on similarity search applications and other applications that can leverage the math-in-place capabilities of the APU. We see demand for the APU in artificial intelligence applications, including approximate nearest neighbor searches, natural language processing, cryptography, and synthetic aperture radar as well as other fields where the technology’s superior speed at a very low power consumption is needed.
 Similarity search uses a technique called distance metric learning, in which learning algorithms measure how similar or related objects are. Our APU is well suited for very fast similarity search because its design enables distance metric learning using fast computation speeds with high degrees of accuracy. Our APU is further differentiated from other solutions in the market by its scalability for very large datasets. The use of visual search, a subset of similarity search, is forecasted to grow rapidly as AI is adopted by the online retail industry. The APU has demonstrated the ability to increase the rate of computation for visual search by orders of magnitude with greater accuracy and reduced power consumption. This kind of performance has the potential to transform online retailers’ capabilities to run search queries and improve customers’ online shopping experience.
The APU’s higher speeds and increased accuracy in similarity search has been shown to speed drug discovery, which can potentially lower drug discovery costs, an important consideration for research organizations dependent on funding. The APU is well suited for enhancing drug discovery work because it can perform similarity searches using very descriptive molecular representations in a virtual environment. This can significantly reduce the cost of developing drugs by allowing virtual screening and requires less use of physical laboratories. Use of AI products like the APU could reduce costs, increase drug efficacy and safety, and increase speed to market thereby potentially saving billions of dollars. For these reasons, the APU is drawing interest from prospective customers in the pharmaceutical and genomics industries.
Our associative computing technology utilizes in-memory associative processor structures to address the bottlenecks that limit performance and increase power consumption in CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs when processing large datasets. By constantly having to move operands and results in and out of devices with ever increasing processing speeds and bus speeds, current solutions are focused on memory transfers rather than addressing the basic computation problem. By changing the computational framework to parallel processing and having search functions conducted directly in a processing memory array, the APU has the potential to greatly expedite computation and response times in “big data” applications. We believe that our state-of-the-art circuit design expertise will enable us to develop high-quality associative processors based upon our patented, in-place associative computing technology and algorithms. We are creating a new category of computing products that are expected to have substantial target markets and a large new customer base in those markets. Our associative computing products have shown to improve system performance, reduce query response times from hours to seconds and at the same time significantly reduce power consumption and system cost.

New Markets for the APU
The APU is capable of processing large data arrays without having to simultaneously transfer data and input new data. Not only does this capability provide a very cost competitive solution for large database similarity search, but the mathematical capabilities of the APU also create new opportunities for using real-time causal processing. Furthermore, GSI’s expertise in developing radiation-tolerant components creates new opportunities in the growing market for AI products that can be used in low earth orbit and space applications, where other AI products are not able to survive the harsh environment. These are all additional markets experiencing growth that could benefit from our technology.
APU Board Level Product
Our APU technology is currently being used in the medical industry, and is being evaluated in digital signal processing, face recognition, and cybersecurity markets. Our current product is a half-length PCIe card that will fit into a blade, rack, or desktop server. There is a higher capability full length card being introduced this year and as part of our strategy to expand the total addressable market for our board product, GSI is developing other form factors and product configurations.
High-Speed Synchronous SRAM Market Overview
Over the past 20 years, the demand for high-speed synchronous SRAMs has been dominated by the networking and telecom industry, which incorporates SRAM into high-performance routers, switches, and other end-products. The networking and telecom industry’s demand for high-speed synchronous SRAMs has accounted for more than 70% of the total addressable market while the remaining market consisted of military/defense and aerospace applications, audio/video processing, test and measurement equipment, medical and automotive applications, and other miscellaneous applications.
However, for the past decade the networking and telecom market demand for high-speed synchronous SRAMs has been steadily declining due to the industry trend of embedding greater amounts of SRAM into each generation of ASICs/controllers products, thereby reducing the need for external SRAMs. We expect this decline in demand from the networking and telecom market to continue. As a result, the demand for external high-speed synchronous SRAMs in new end-products is being driven by what had previously been considered secondary markets, the greatest of those being military/defense and aerospace applications. Such applications require a combination of high densities and high random transaction rates that GSI is well positioned to serve, being the only SRAM manufacturer to offer 288Mb densities as well as offering the highest truly random transaction rate in the industry – 1866 million transactions per second (MT/s). To further serve the military/defense and aerospace markets, GSI has been focusing on qualifying its products for space/satellite applications to capitalize on opportunities resulting from the development of near-earth orbiting satellite mega constellations, as well as the more traditional geo-stationary earth orbit satellite communication platforms and national assets. 
High-Speed Synchronous SRAM Products
We offer four families of high-speed synchronous SRAMs – SyncBurst™, NBT™, SigmaQuad™, and SigmaDDR™. They feature high density, high transaction rate, high data bandwidth, low latency, and low power consumption. We commit to offering our products for longer periods of time than our competitors, typically ten years or more following their initial introduction, including die shrinks. 
These four product families provide the basis for approximately 10,000 individual part numbers. They are available in several density and data width configurations and are available in a variety of performance, feature, temperature, and package options. Our products can be found in a wide range of networking and 

5



telecommunications equipment, including core routers, multi-service access routers, universal gateways, enterprise edge routers, service provider edge routers, optical edge routers, fast Ethernet switches and wireless base stations. We also sell our products to OEMs that manufacture products for military and aerospace applications such as radar and guidance systems and satellites, for professional audio applications such as sound mixing systems, for test and measurement applications such as high-speed testers, for automotive applications such as smart cruise control, and for medical applications such as ultrasound and CAT scan equipment.
Synchronous SRAM timing is controlled by a clock that defines its operating frequency. Some are “common I/O” (common input/output data bus), and some are “separate I/O” (separate input and output data busses). Additionally, some are “single data rate” (SDR), in which one unit of data is transferred per clock cycle, and some are “double data rate” (DDR), in which two units of data are transferred per clock cycle. The “Quad” in our SigmaQuad product name refers to its ability to send and receive DDR data simultaneously, in the same clock cycle. 
SyncBurst™ and NBT™ SRAMs.     Synchronous Burst (SyncBurst) and No Bus Turnaround (NBT) SRAMs implement a common I/O, SDR bus protocol. SyncBurst SRAMs were originally developed for microprocessor cache applications, but eventually migrated to many diverse applications. NBT SRAMs are offshoots of the SyncBurst SRAM architecture and were developed specifically to address the needs of networking and telecom applications. They feature a bus protocol designed to minimize or eliminate idle cycles when switching between read and write operations. Both families can perform burst data transfers or single data transfers at the discretion of the user. Both families come with pipeline and flow-through mode options.
Our SyncBurst and NBT SRAMs are available in densities from 4 Mb to 288 Mb (four times greater than the nearest competition), with operating frequencies up to 400 MHz (up to sixty percent greater than other suppliers). They can be operated with supply voltages of 1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3V.
SigmaQuad™ and SigmaDDR™ Products.    SigmaQuad SRAMs implement a separate I/O, DDR bus protocol, while SigmaDDR SRAMs implement a common I/O, DDR bus protocol. They were developed specifically to meet the rapidly growing density and random transaction rate requirements of networking and telecom applications, requirements that NBT SRAMs are unable to meet, and have been used extensively in those markets for the past 15 years. They include the highest performance SRAMs available in the market today, with random transaction rates up to 1866 MT/s – forty percent greater than the nearest competition. Both product families have burst-of-2 and burst-of-4 options.
We have developed several generations of SigmaQuad and SigmaDDR SRAMs, with increasing performance capability, referred to as Type-I, Type-II, Type-II+, Type-IIIe, and Type-IVe. They are available in densities from 18Mb to 288Mb (two times greater than the nearest competition), with operating frequencies up to 1333 MHz. They can be operated with a range of supply voltages depending on the generation. 
RadHard and RadTolerant SRAM Products. We have committed to introduce and market radiation-hardened, or “RadHard”, and radiation-tolerant, or “RadTolerant”, SRAMs for aerospace and military applications such as networking satellites and missiles. Our initial RadHard and RadTolerant products are 288 megabit, 144 megabit, and 72 megabit devices from our SigmaQuad-II+ family. We have also expanded to include 144 megabit, 72 megabit, and 32 megabit SyncBurst and NBT SRAMs RadTolerant products to enable the avionics and other space platforms that have historically leveraged smaller asynchronous devices. The RadHard products are housed in a hermetically-sealed ceramic column grid array package, and undergo a special fabrication process that diminishes the adverse effects of high-radiation environments.

​
● Seek new market opportunities. We intend to supplement our internal development activities by seeking additional opportunities to acquire other businesses, product lines or technologies, or enter into strategic partnerships, that would complement our current product lines, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise provide growth opportunities.
​
Customers
Historically, our primary sales and marketing strategy has been to achieve design wins with leading OEMs in the networking and telecommunications markets and the other markets we serve. With the development of our new in-place associative computing products, we are focusing sales and marketing efforts in the markets for “big data” (including CNNs), natural language processing, computer vision and cyber security with our initial focus in this area being for similarity search applications including facial recognition, drug discovery and drug toxicity, signal and object detection and cryptography.
The following is a representative list of our OEM customers that directly or indirectly purchased more than $500,000 of our SRAM products in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------+---+----------+---+-----------------
BAE Systems | | Ciena | | General Dynamics
Honeywell | | Lockheed | | Nokia 
Rockwell | | ​ | | ​ 

​
Many of our OEM customers use contract manufacturers to assemble their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues is derived from sales to these contract manufacturers and to consignment warehouses who purchase products from us for use by contract manufacturers. In addition, we sell our products to OEM customers indirectly through domestic and international distributors.
In the case of sales of our products to distributors and consignment warehouses, the decision to purchase our products is typically made by the OEM customers. In the case of contract manufacturers, OEM customers typically provide a list of approved products to the contract manufacturer, which then has discretion whether or not to purchase our products from that list.
Direct sales to contract manufacturers and consignment warehouses accounted for 43.7%, 33.7% and 41.3% of our net revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 54.7%, 61.3% and 56.0% of our net revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

​
Nokia was our largest customer in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. Nokia purchases products directly from us and through contract manufacturers and distributors. Based on information provided to us by its contract manufacturers and our distributors, purchases by Nokia represented approximately 39%, 38% and 45% of our net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. To our knowledge, none of our other OEM customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in any of these periods.
Sales, Marketing and Technical Support
We sell our products primarily through our worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors. As of March 31, 2021, we employed 18 sales and marketing personnel, and were supported by over 200 independent sales representatives, which we believe will enable us to address an expanded customer base with the continuing introduction of our associative computing products in fiscal 2022. We believe that our relationship with our U.S. distributor, Avnet, puts us in a strong position to address the Very Fast SRAM memory market in the United States. We currently have regional sales offices located in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel and the United States. We believe this international coverage allows us to better serve our distributors and OEM customers by providing them with coordinated support. We believe that our customers’ purchasing decisions are based primarily on product performance, availability, features, quality, reliability, price, manufacturing flexibility and service. Many of our OEM customers have had long-term relationships with us based on our success in meeting these criteria.
Our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, these orders are not firm and hence we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales. We have recently experienced price increases for raw materials and manufacturing services due to the tightness in the semiconductor market and have responded with increased pricing to our customers. We typically provide a warranty of up to 36 months on our products. Liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to replacement of defective products.
Our marketing efforts are, first and foremost, focused on ensuring that the products we develop meet or exceed our customers’ needs. Historically, those efforts have been focused on defining our high-performance SRAM product roadmap by working closely with key customers to understand their roadmaps and to ensure that the products we develop meet their requirements (primary aspects of which include functionality, performance, electrical interfaces, power, and schedule). More recently, our marketing efforts have been expanded to include marketing the new in-place associative computing products that we are developing. Our marketing group also provides technical, strategic and tactical sales support to our direct sales personnel, sales representatives and distributors. This support includes in-depth product presentations, datasheets, application notes, simulation models, 

9



sales tools, marketing communications, marketing research, trademark administration and other support functions. We also engage in various marketing activities to increase brand awareness.
 We emphasize customer service and technical support in an effort to provide our OEM customers with the knowledge and resources necessary to successfully use our products in their designs. Our customer service organization includes a technical team of applications engineers, technical marketing personnel and, when required, product design engineers. We provide customer support throughout the qualification and sales process and continue providing follow-up service after the sale of our products and on an ongoing basis. In addition, we provide our OEM customers with comprehensive datasheets, application notes and reference designs and access to our FPGA controller IP for use in their product development.
Manufacturing
We outsource our wafer fabrication, assembly and wafer sort testing, which enables us to focus on our design strengths, minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing technologies. Our engineers work closely with our outsource partners to increase yields, reduce manufacturing costs, and help assure the quality of our products.
Currently, all of our SRAM and APU wafers are manufactured by TSMC under individually negotiated purchase orders. We do not currently have a long-term supply contract with our foundry, and, therefore, TSMC is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specified period, in any specified quantity or at any specified price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. Our future success depends in part on our ability to secure sufficient capacity at TSMC or other independent foundries to supply us with the wafers we require.
The majority of our current SRAM products are manufactured using 0.13 micron, 90 nanometer, 65 nanometer and 40 nanometer process technologies on 300 millimeter wafers at TSMC. Our current in-place associative computing products are manufactured at TSMC using 28 nanometer process technology.
Our master die methodology enables multiple product families, and variations thereof, to be manufactured from a single mask set. As a result, based upon the way available die from a wafer are metalized, wire bonded, packaged and tested, we can create a number of different products. The manufacturing process consists of two phases, the first of which takes approximately eight to twelve weeks and results in wafers that have the potential to yield multiple products within a given product family. After the completion of this phase, the wafers are stored pending customer orders. Once we receive orders for a particular product, we perform the second phase, consisting of final wafer processing, assembly, burn-in and test, which takes approximately ten to eighteen weeks to complete. This two-step manufacturing process enables us to significantly shorten our product lead times, providing flexibility for customization and to increase the availability of our products.
All of our manufactured wafers, including wafers for our APU product, are tested for electrical compliance and most are packaged at Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, which is located in Taiwan. Our test procedures require that all of our products be subjected to accelerated burn-in and extensive functional electrical testing which is performed at our Taiwan and U.S. test facilities. Our radiation-hardened products are assembled and tested at STS, located near our Sunnyvale, California headquarters facility.
Research and Development
We have devoted substantial resources in the last five years on the development of a new category of in-place associative computing products. Our research and development staff includes engineering professionals with extensive experience in the areas of high-speed circuit design, including SRAM design, DRAM design and systems level networking and telecommunications equipment design, and are well suited for the development of our 

10



associative computing products. Additionally, we have assembled a team of software development experts in Israel needed for the development of the various levels of software required in the use of our associative computing products. The design process for our products is complex. As a result, we have made substantial investments in computer-aided design and engineering resources to manage our design process.
Competition
Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies, some of which have substantially greater resources, offer other types of memory and/or non-memory technologies and may have longer standing relationships with OEM customers than we do. Unlike us, some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabs, which may, at times, provide them with capacity, cost and technical advantages.
Our principal competitors include Cypress Semiconductor (Infineon Technologies AG), Integrated Silicon Solution, Micron and REC for our SRAM products. NVIDIA Corporation and Intel Corporation are prospective competitors for our in-place associative computing products. Other competitors are expected to enter this field as well. While some of our competitors offer a broader array of products and offer some of their products at lower prices than we do, we believe that our focus on performance leadership provides us with key competitive advantages.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for “big data” and memory products for the networking and telecommunications markets depends on a number of factors, including:
● product performance, features, quality, reliability and price; 
● manufacturing flexibility, product availability and customer service throughout the lifetime of the product; 
● the timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors; and 
● our ability to anticipate and conform to new industry standards.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors based on these factors. However, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to any of these factors. Our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business.
The market for networking memory products is competitive and is characterized by technological change, declining average selling prices and product obsolescence. Competition could increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products. This increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share.
In addition, we are vulnerable to advances in technology by competitors, including new SRAM architectures as well as new forms of DRAM and other new memory technologies. Because we have limited experience developing IC products other than Very Fast SRAMs, any efforts by us to introduce new products based on new technology, including our new in-place associative computing products, may not be successful and, as a result, our business may suffer.

11



Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property. We believe that it is important to maintain a large patent portfolio to protect our innovations. We currently hold 113 United States patents, including 62 memory patents and 51 associative computing patents, and have in excess of a dozen patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are also important in maintaining our competitive position. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, distributors, customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information. Our intellectual property rights, if challenged, may not be upheld as valid, may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation. We or our foundry from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past. We have been subject to other intellectual property claims in the past and we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future. Litigation by or against us relating to allegations of patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. Licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us. If we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us, we could incur substantial liabilities and be required to suspend the manufacture of products or the use by our foundry of certain processes.
Human Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2021, we had 178 full-time employees, including 110 engineers, of which 88 are engaged in research and development and 52 have PhD or MS degrees, 18 employees in sales and marketing, 10 employees in general and administrative capacities and 66 employees in manufacturing. Of these employees, 62 are based in our Sunnyvale facility, 59 are based in our Taiwan facility and 42 are based in our Israel facility. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled, engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Compensation and benefits
​
Our goal is to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adhering to our company values. We offer competitive compensation and benefit programs including a 401(k) Plan, stock options for all employees, flexible spending accounts and paid time off. 

12



Diversity, inclusion and belonging
​
We are committed to our continued efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports the global workforce and the communities we serve. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our executive leadership team.
Health and safety
​
We are committed to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Our policies and practices are intended to protect our employees and surrounding communities in which we operate.
In fiscal 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business including the practice of social distancing, wearing face coverings mandated by state and local regulations, and maintaining a quarantine for employees determined to be in close contact with a COVID-19 case. For example, since March 2020, except for our employees located in Taiwan, the majority of our employees have worked from home around the world. In May 2021, with the surge in COVID-19 infections in Taiwan, our employees in Taiwan have begun working from home under alternating schedules
