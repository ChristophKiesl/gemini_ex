DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
Bio Lab Naturals, Inc.
 
History
 
Our predecessor, Vyta Corp, was incorporated in Nevada in June 1996. Until June 2009, Vyta Corp, through its wholly owned subsidiary BioAgra, LLC, was involved in the sale and manufacturing of a natural additive for use in the animal feed industry. On May 15, 2009, Vyta Corp ceased its operational activities. On June 30, 2009, Vyta Corp filed a Form 15-15D, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to cease its filing obligations under the Securities Act of 1934. On August 20, 2010, it changed its state of incorporation to Delaware and on November 5, 2010, and through a holding company reorganization reorganized as Bio Lab Naturals, Inc. (the “Company or “Bio Lab”). Its predecessor was divested as a subsidiary.

The Company changed its year end from June 30th to December 31st and, therefore, the consolidated financial statements include a short year as of and for the period July 1, 2019 (Inception) through December 31, 2019.
 
Reorganization Activities
 
On August 20, 2010, Vyta Corp (Nevada) executed a redomicile merger with its wholly owned subsidiary Vyta Corp (Delaware). As a result of the merger the Company’s corporate domicile moved from Nevada to Delaware. On September 16, 2010, Vyta Corp and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 10 Vyta, Inc., with Bio Lab Naturals, Inc. entered into a Holding Company Reorganization/Merger Transaction pursuant to Delaware Statute 251(g), whereby the Company was reorganized with 10 Vyta, Inc., with Bio Lab Naturals, Inc. being the survivor holding company, and 10 Vyta was divested thereafter. The shareholders of the Company became the shareholders of Bio Lab Naturals, Inc. (hereinafter the “Company”) with no change in the number of shares.
 
In 2010, the Company executed a merger with Bio Protein, Inc. As part of the merger, the Company exchanged 40 shares of its outstanding common stock for one share of Bio Protein, Inc. (Colorado.) This merger was rescinded April 10, 2013 and 6,868,260 shares were agreed to be cancelled. The name was changed back to Vyta Corp, but such was changed back to Bio Lab Naturals, Inc. when there failed to be shareholder approval.
 
The Company agreed to a merger with Set Net Global, Inc. in 2015 and changed its name, but the merger was never completed and the name was returned to Bio Lab Naturals, Inc.
 
On December 31, 2019, Bio Lab Naturals, Inc., PTL Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“PTL Acquisition Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bio Lab Naturals, Inc., domiciled in Colorado and Prime Time Live, Inc. (“PTL”), a Colorado corporation entered into a Plan of Reorganization. PTL Acquisition Sub merged with PTL where PTL Acquisition Sub became the surviving entity in exchange for one share of the Company’s common stock being issued for each share of PTL’s 5,500,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock. A total of 6,931,061 shares of the Company’s common stock were cancelled. PTL Acquisition Sub changed its name to Prime Time Live, Inc.
 
On September 17, 2019, PTL was incorporated in the State of Colorado and effective October 11, 2019, acquired all of the event services business of Prime Time Mobile Event Screens LLC (“PTMVES”) in exchange for PTL issuing 350,000 shares of its common stock to the owner of PTMVES. The transaction was accounted for by PTL as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805.
 
Our executive offices are located at 7400 E. Crestline Circle, Suite #130, Greenwood Village, CO 80111 and the telephone number is (720) 273-0433. We maintain a website at www.primetimeliveevents.com, and such website is not incorporated into or a part of this filing.
 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2020, our last fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:
 

5
-


- | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:
 
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
 
Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. 
 
Prime Time Live, Inc.
 
Summary 
 
Our subsidiary, Prime Time Live, Inc., is a Denver, CO based company that specializes in providing clients with high resolution mobile LED screens for entertainment, corporate, civic and sporting events. PTL, that included its predecessor PTMVES has been in the event services business since 2011. Its main operations are derived from its 30’ x 18’ LED mobile video display. This display is mounted in a 53 ft. trailer with an accompanying MQ Whisper Watt generator that can power the LED screen for 50 hours, and therefore, provides our clients with true portability.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, PTL generated $21,000 in event screen rental fees from 2 events. For the year 2019, PTL and its predecessor, PTMVES generated $139,562 in event screen rental fees from 16 events.
 
There are yet any revenues or commitments from either its promotional offers for sponsors or fan villages.
 On November 13, 2020, PTL signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Insane Impact, LLC to act as Insane Impact’s exclusive distributor of Insane Impact Products. Insane Impact shall provide leads of LED screens for PTL sales and rental to our customers.
 Screens 
 
At December 31, 2020, Prime Time Live, Inc. owned two different screen sizes. The 30’ x 18’ mobile LED screen that was installed inside a 53 ft. trailer and an 8’ x 5’ mobile LED screen that is towed by a mid-size SUV. The 30’ x 18’ screen was sold during January 2021 for $14,700 and the 8’ x 5’ mobile LED screen is new where less than 10 hours have been used. The Company has yet to decide how it will replace the 30” x 18” mobile LED screen.

-

Sponsors 
 
Prime Time Live, Inc. will offer companies sponsorship opportunities by placing the sponsor’s name on the side of the semi-truck in addition to advertising on the LED screens. PTL is still determining the time frame of when this service will be offered and the fees charged for such services.
Fan Villages 
 
Prime Time Live, Inc. offers event planners an opportunity to create a fan village. A fan village is the main place at the event where people can purchase refreshments, watch the entertainment, and interact with sponsors. Prime Time Live, Inc.’s fan village is created for each event to increase people’s desire to stay for longer periods of time. PTL is in the infancy stages of when this concept will be offered as well as the revenue generated.
Going Forward
 
Prime Time Live, Inc. plans to:
 

· | Refurbish its 53 ft. semi-trailer during the first quarter of 2021 at a cost of approximately $115,000 in order to lease it to third parties during the year 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We anticipate needing an estimated $150,000 in capital to continue our business operations and expansion. We do not have committed sources for these additional funds and will need to be obtained through debt or equity placements or a combination of those. We previously achieved a private placement of $262,000 for interim capital.
 
Below is an overview of the Bio Lab’s corporate structure.

COVID-19
 In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged and has subsequently spread worldwide. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. The Company continues to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations at the national, state, and local level to evaluate possible extensions to all or part of such closures.
 As the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and rapidly evolving, the Company's plans as described above may change. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Ongoing Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19
 
Operations, Liquidity, and Capital Resources
 
Companies have undertaken and are generally in the process of making a diverse range of operational adjustments in response to the effects of COVID-19. These adjustments are numerous and include a transition to telework; supply chain and distribution adjustments; and suspending or modifying certain operations to comply with health and safety guidelines to protect employees, contractors, and customers, including in connection with a transition back to the workplace. These types of adjustments may have an effect on a company that would be material to an investment or voting decision, and affected companies should carefully consider their obligations to disclose this information to investors. Companies also are undertaking a diverse and sometimes complex range of financing activities in response to the effects of COVID-19 on their businesses and markets. These activities may involve obtaining and utilizing credit facilities, accessing public and private markets, implementing supplier finance programs, and negotiating new or modified customer payment terms. The SEC has required a discussion of COVID-19 related considerations, specific facts and circumstances and make disclosures to address the following questions:

· | What are the material operational challenges that management and the Board of Directors are monitoring and evaluating?
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We are
challenged by the gathering restrictions under state and local rules and lack of events due to cancellation.



· | How and to what extent have you altered your operations, such as implementing health and safety policies for employees, contractors, and customers, to deal with these challenges, including challenges related to employees returning to the workplace?
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have
kept our employees to nominal, using contract service providers. We have not implemented “customer” health and
safety as it is not applicable to our business. Event promoters deal with those issues.



· | How are the changes impacting or reasonably likely to impact your financial condition and short- and long-term liquidity?
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The changes
will not impact our financial condition.



· | How is your overall liquidity position and outlook evolving?
--+-------------------------------------------------------------



We have
improved our liquidity through our private placement of $262,000 and the outlook is better for improved revenues.



· | To the extent COVID-19 is adversely impacting your revenues, consider whether such impacts are material to your sources and uses of funds, as well as the materiality of any assumptions you make about the magnitude and duration of COVID-19’s impact on your revenues. Are any decreases in cash flow from operations having a material impact on your liquidity position and outlook?
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



COVID-19
has reduced our historical revenues by 100%. The bans on events and gatherings are very material to our sources and use of funds.
Our reduced cash flows from operations has materially impacted our growth aspirations.



· | Have you accessed revolving lines of credit or raised capital in the public or private markets to address your liquidity needs?
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have
not used lines of credit, but we have raised $262,000 in a private placement of our common stock.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



No. If
we cannot continue with capital raising, we will not be able to sustain any significant operations.



· | Are you at material risk of not meeting covenants in your credit and other agreements?
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Not applicable.

Not applicable.



· | Are there estimates or assumptions underlying such metrics the disclosure of which is necessary for the metric not to be misleading?

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There
is no impact of these reductions upon our ability to generate revenues or meet financial obligations.



· | Are you able to timely service your debt and other obligations?
--+----------------------------------------------------------------



Yes, we
have no debt and other obligations are minimal.



· | Have you taken advantage of available payment deferrals, forbearance periods, or other concessions? What are those concessions and how long will they last?
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Not applicable.



· | Do you foresee any liquidity challenges once those accommodations end?
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Not applicable.



· | Have you altered terms with your customers, such as extended payment terms or refund periods, and if so, how have those actions materially affected your financial condition or liquidity?
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have
not altered terms with customers.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have
not provided concessions or modified terms of arrangements that will have a material impact.

· | Are you relying on supplier finance programs, otherwise referred to as supply chain financing, structured trade payables, reverse factoring, or vendor financing, to manage your cash flow?
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Not applicable



· | Have you assessed the impact material events that occurred after the end of the reporting period, but before the financial statements were issued, have had or are reasonably likely to have on your liquidity and capital resources and considered whether disclosure of subsequent events in the financial statements and known trends or uncertainties in MD&A is required?
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There
are no material events occurring after the end of the reporting period but before financial statements were issued which would
have any effect on liquidity or capital resources and there are no new trends or uncertainties needed to be disclosed.


Government Assistance – The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)
 
The CARES Act includes financial assistance for companies in the form of loans and tax relief in the form of deferred or reduced payments and potential refunds. Companies receiving federal assistance must consider the short- and long-term impact of that assistance on their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources, as well as the related disclosures and critical accounting estimates and assumptions. We have not received any financial assistance from the banks or any government agency.

no loans.

--+-------------------------------------------------------

A Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
 
The SEC has advised that Management should consider whether conditions and events, taken as a whole, raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance of the financial statements. There is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern due to continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and we make the following disclosure:

· | Are there conditions and events that give rise to the substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern?
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Yes, the
continuation of COVID-19 prohibitions will continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to grow, maintain and expand our
business and generate revenues.



· | For example, have you defaulted on outstanding obligations?
--+------------------------------------------------------------



No.



· | Have you faced labor challenges or a work stoppage?
--+----------------------------------------------------



Not applicable.



· | What are your plans to address these challenges?
--+-------------------------------------------------



Our Company
can only wait for COVID-19 to recede so that its events for medium to large gatherings are allowed again.



· | Have you implemented any portion of those plans?
--+-------------------------------------------------



No.


INDUSTRY ANALYSIS AND HISTORY
 
Barriers to Entry in the Event Production Industry
 
There is one major barrier to entry into the Event Production Industry which is capital. We have very limited capital with which to compete in this industry. Many other competitors have been in the business for many years and have very large capital resources and an established reputation. Our barriers to entry are, in addition to lack of capital, lack of reputation, lack of recognition, part-time management, lack of financial history to raise money, and lack of equity in our Company upon which to base a capital raise.
Competitive Factors Impacting Our Ability to Gain Market Share
 
Our competition enjoys advantages which may prevent us from achieving a market share due to our competitors’ known reputations, large funding abilities, competent management, and capital resources all of which will impede our abilities to achieve market share.
 
Competitive Factors in the Industry
 
There are numerous entities, large advertising companies, and private investors which will compete for the same business in which we intend to engage. We will be at a significant disadvantage to all of these other competitors for the foreseeable future. All of our competitors should be considered to be far better capitalized than we are.


12
--

Registrant’s Competitive Position in the Industry
 
Registrant is an insignificant participant in the event production industry and cannot be expected to obtain a market share even discernable percentage wise. Without a large infusion of capital, it will remain a very small participant in the industry.
Historical Track Records
 
Our Company has no historical track record and we should be deemed a pure start-up of earning or operating with all of the risks of an unproven Company (see “Risk Factors”).
COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
 
Competition
 
There are a large number of companies and individuals engaged in the event production industry; accordingly, there is a high degree of competition. Almost all of the companies and individuals so engaged have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we do.
 
We are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the funding of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
 
Investment Company Act of 1940
 
Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities within the definitions and parameters which would make us subject to the “1940 Act.” In the event we engage in business activities that result in us holding investment interests in a number of entities, we might become subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an Investment Company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. Under no circumstances does the Company intend to become an investment Company and its activities and its financial statement ratios of assets and cash will be carefully monitored and other activities reviewed by the Board to prevent being classified or inadvertently becoming an investment Company which would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
As a fundamental concept, the 1940 Act requires registration of companies that invest and manage funds to invest for others and trade in securities of other companies. Those companies that cross a threshold of 40% of assets in cash and stock in other companies may be required to register. Investment companies may issue face amount certificates, be a Unit Investment Trust, or be a mutual fund. We intend to do several things to remain outside of the 1940 Act: a) we will not trade in securities of other companies or manage investments for others, b) we intend to carefully monitor our ratios of cash and securities to total assets to avoid crossing the 1940 Act threshold, c) we do not intend to issue face amount certificates, d) we do not intend to distribute profits and dividends to our shareholders on an annual or shorter basis, if ever, e) we do not pass through profits and losses to our shareholders on a tax basis, f) we will not issue Units in investment trusts, g) we will not act as a mutual fund, and h) we will not invest funds on behalf of others.
 
We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3(c)(4) and (5) of the 1940 Act.
 
Markets.
 
Our market is highly competitive and constantly changing. Commercial success is frequently dependent on capital availability, the effectiveness and sufficiency of which are very difficult to predict accurately.

13
--

Governmental Regulation.
 
Federal Regulations.
 
We are subject to regulations by securities laws as a public Company. We do not intend to become an investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, but if we exceed certain thresholds of certain assets or our business operations cease to fall within certain exemptions, we might inadvertently become subject to the Act.
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations.
 
We are not involved in operations with environmental considerations for our business.
 
State Regulations.
 
Certain states may require that we obtain a Local Business License. We intend to address this on an as needed basis. We know of no other regulations that would affect our business for temporary screen locations for events as the locations generally allow our screens.
 
For additional information about these matters, see “Risk Factors.”
 
LICENSES
 
None.
 
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
 
None.
 
BACKLOG OF ORDERS
 
We currently have no backlogs of orders for sales, at this time.
 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
 
We have no government contracts.
 
COMPANY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We are not conducting any research.
 
NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED
 
We have 3 independent contractors who work approximately 20 hours per week. All officers and directors work approximately 10 hours per week under their appropriate responsibility.
 
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES/ASSETS
 

(a) | Real Estate. | None.

Our executive offices are located in Denver, Colorado. We do not own any real property but lease an office space consisting of approximately 1100 sq. ft. among all our corporate and subsidiary locations. We believe that substantially all our property and equipment is in good condition, subject to normal wear and tear, and that our facilities have sufficient capacity to meet the current needs of our business.
 
REPORTS TO SECURITIES HOLDERS
 
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10-K annually and Form 10-Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8-K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
