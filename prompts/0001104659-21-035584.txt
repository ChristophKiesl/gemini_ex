Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (“Business Combination”). We were formed as Automalyst LLC, a Delaware limited liability company on March 13, 2018, and converted into a Delaware corporation on August 24, 2020. We consummated an initial public offering (“Public Offering”) on October 14, 2020.
 
We intend to use the cash proceeds from our Public Offering and Private Placement (as defined below) as well as additional issuances, if any, of our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt, including the Private Investment in a Public Company (“PIPE Investment”), to complete the Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
The Company’s management team is led by Tilman Fertitta, our Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Handler, our Co-Chairman and President. Mr. Fertitta is the sole shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TJF, LLC (“TJF Sponsor”) and Mr. Handler is the Chief Executive Officer of Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“JFG Sponsor”), and its largest operating subsidiary, Jefferies Group LLC, a global investment banking firm. The Company’s sponsors are TJF Sponsor and JFG Sponsor (collectively, the “Sponsors”).
 
On October 14, 2020 we consummated a $500,000,000 Public Offering consisting of 50,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (“Unit”). Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Class A common stock”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously, with the closing of the Public Offering, we consummated a $12,000,000 private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 8,000,000 warrants (“Sponsor Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The Sponsor Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering except that, so long as they are held by our Sponsors or their permitted transferees, (i) they are not redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our Sponsors until 30 days after the completion of our initial Business Combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.

Prior to the Public Offering, in 2018, JFG, through a subsidiary, purchased 100% of the membership interest in the Company for $1,000. On August 24, 2020, TJF purchased 51.7% membership interest in the Company for $1,070. Simultaneously, the Company converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and its previously outstanding membership interests converted into shares of Class B common stock. The total number of authorized shares of all classes of capital stock to 401,000,000, of which 380,000,000 shares are Class A common stock; 20,000,000 shares are Class B shares at par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”); and 1,000,000 shares are preferred stock at par value $0.0001 per share. The Sponsors held an aggregate of 11,500,000 Class B shares based on the proportional interest in the Company. On September 16, 2020, the Company conducted a 1:1.25 stock split of the Founder Shares so that a total of 14,375,000 Founder Shares were issued and outstanding. An aggregate of 1,875,000 Founder Shares were forfeited because the underwriters did not exercise their over-allotment option. As of December 31, 2020, JFG and TJF owned an aggregate of 12,500,000 Founder Shares based on their proportional interest in the Company.
 
Upon the closing of the Public Offering and Private Placement, $500,000,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Public Offering and the Private Placement (including $17,500,000 of deferred underwriting commissions) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, other than the withdrawal of interest to pay tax obligations, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released until the earliest of: (i) the completion of the Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any shares of Class A common stock included in the Units being sold in the Public Offering (“Public Shares”) properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the Business Combination by October 14, 2022 (within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering); or (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination by October 14, 2022, subject to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account can only be invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we had a balance in cash and investments held in trust of $500,078,624. As of December 31, 2020, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes. We expect to pay our franchise tax liability of $71,388 from the trust earnings in the first quarter of 2021.
 
The remaining $12,000,000 held outside of trust was used to pay underwriting commissions of $10,000,000, loans to our Sponsors, and deferred offering and formation costs. As of December 31, 2020, we had an unrestricted balance of $1,017,406 to satisfy our working capital purposes.

Proposed Business Combination
 
On January 24, 2021, our board of directors, unanimously approved an agreement and plan of merger, dated January 24, 2021, by and among the Company, Helios Sun Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), HMAN Group Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Hillman Holdco”) and CCMP Sellers’ Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative thereunder (in such capacity, the “Stockholder Representative”) (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). If the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the transactions under the Merger Agreement are consummated, Merger Sub will merge with and into Hillman Holdco with Hillman Holdco surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Proposed Transaction”). Hillman Holdco is a holding company that indirectly holds all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of The Hillman Group, Inc., which, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries (Hillman Holdco, The Hillman Group, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, collectively, “Hillman” and each such entity, a “Hillman Group Entity”), is in the business of providing hardware-related products and related merchandising services to retail markets in North America. In connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, the Company will be renamed “Hillman Solutions Corp.” and is referred to herein as “New Hillman” as of the time following such change of name.
 
Consummation of the Proposed Transaction is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Proposed Transaction and certain other actions related thereto by our stockholders and Hillman Holdco’s stockholders, and the availability of a minimum amount of cash in the Trust Account (and/or from other specified sources, if necessary), after giving effect to redemptions by the Company’s public stockholders, if any. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain circumstances.
 
For additional information regarding Hillman Holdco, Hillman, the Merger Agreement and the Proposed Transaction, see the Proxy Statement/Prospectus initially filed by the Company on February 3, 2021.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing the Business Combination.
 
Subscription Agreements
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement on January 24, 2021, we entered into the subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, including JFG Sponsor (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to issue and sell in private placements an aggregate of 37,500,000 shares of our Class A common stock to the PIPE Investors for $10.00 per share (the “PIPE Private Placement”).
 
The PIPE Private Placement investment is expected to close substantially concurrently with the Closing. In connection with the Closing, all of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, including the shares of Class A common stock issued to the PIPE Investors, will be exchanged, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of New Hillman common stock.
 
The shares of New Hillman common stock to be issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. We will grant the PIPE Investors certain registration rights in connection with the PIPE Private Placement. The PIPE Private Placement is contingent upon, among other things, the closing of the Proposed Transaction.

A&R Letter Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, our Sponsors, each member of our Board and each of our executive officers entered into an amended and restated letter agreement (the “A&R Letter Agreement”). Like the letter agreements entered into by such persons in connection with our initial public offering or their appointment to the board, pursuant to the A&R Letter Agreement each of our Sponsors, directors and members of the management team have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares (as defined below) and public shares in connection with the completion of the Proposed Transaction; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination by October 14, 2022, or to provide for redemption in connection with a Business Combination and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by October 14, 2022, although they will be entitled to redemption or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the prescribed time frame; (iv) vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of the Proposed Transaction, (v) not to transfer or sell (subject to certain limited exceptions) (1) the founder shares until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the reported closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading-day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property, or (2) the private placement warrants and the Class A common stock underlying such warrants, until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
In addition, the A&R Letter Agreement provides that, at the Closing, (i) our Sponsors will waive any adjustment to the conversion ratio set forth in our governing documents or any other anti-dilution or similar protection with respect to the shares of Class B common stock (whether resulting from the PIPE Private Placement or otherwise), and (ii) the Sponsors will forfeit an aggregate of 2,828,000 shares of our Class B common stock otherwise issuable to them upon conversion of their founder shares and that the TJF Founder will forfeit an additional 1,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock otherwise issuable to it upon conversion of its founder shares.

Hillman Holdco Voting and Support Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain Hillman Holdco stockholders (the “Hillman Holdco supporting stockholders”) entered into a voting and support agreement with the Company. Under the Hillman Holdco voting and support agreement, the Hillman Holdco supporting stockholders agreed that they will not transfer, and will deliver a written consent with respect to their shares of Hillman Holdco common stock in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, promptly following the time at which the registration statement of the shares issuable in connection with the Proposed Transaction shall have been declared effective.
Registration Rights Agreement
 
At the Closing, New Hillman, our Sponsors and the Hillman Holdco supporting stockholders will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) New Hillman will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, certain shares of New Hillman common stock and other equity securities of New Hillman that are held by the parties thereto from time to time, (ii) our Sponsors and the Hillman Holdco supporting stockholders will be granted certain registration rights and (iii) our Sponsors will reaffirm the lock-up they agreed to in the A&R Letter Agreement and the Hillman Holdco supporting stockholders will agree to a lock-up under which they will not sell, for the period set forth therein, the shares of New Hillman common stock they will receive in the Business Combination.
 
In addition, the A&R Registration Rights Agreement will provide for shelf, demand and piggyback registration rights. In addition, the A&R Registration Rights Agreement will provide that, notwithstanding such registration rights, affiliates of CCMP shall not transfer any securities of New Hillman for six months following the Closing and each Sponsor shall not transfer its Founder Shares for one year after the Closing, subject to certain customary expectations.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
8

 

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial Business Combination. In the case of an initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our Sponsors, officers, directors or stockholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. The fair market value of our initial Business Combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as a discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
9

 

In any case, we will only complete an initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsors, officers and directors have entered into the A&R Letter Agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination.
 
10

 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules. We currently intend to hold a stockholder meeting to approve the Proposed Transaction.
 
The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.
 
If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, as we plan to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, we will:
 

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
 
If we seek stockholder approval, as we currently intend to do for the Proposed Transaction, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Sponsors will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the A&R Letter Agreement, our Sponsors, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our Sponsors’ Founder Shares and Public Shares they have purchased, we would need only 17,250,001, or 34.5%, of the 50,000,000 Public Shares sold in the Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial Business Combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial Business Combination approved. We intend to give not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Sponsors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the initial Business Combination or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the initial Business Combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, as we currently intend to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial Business Combination.
 
12

 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until October 14, 2022 (24 months from the closing of the Public Offering) to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within the 24-month time period.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 1510 West Loop South, Houston, Texas 77027. The cost for this space is included in the $20,000 per month fee that we pay Fertitta Entertainment, Inc., (an affiliate of TJF Sponsor) for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
 
13

 

Employees
 
We currently have five officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.
Risk Factors Summary
 
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:
 
• We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
 
• Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, and even if we held a vote, holders of our founder shares will participate in such vote, which means we may complete our initial Business Combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.
 
• If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsors and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial Business Combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.
 
• Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential Business Combination may be limited to the exercise of your redemption rights, unless we seek stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination.
 
14

 

• The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into an initial Business Combination with a target.
 
• The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
 
• The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial Business Combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock.
 
• The requirement that we complete our initial Business Combination within 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a Business Combination and may decrease the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential Business Combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial Business Combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.
 
• Our search for a Business Combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets.
 
• We may not be able to complete our initial Business Combination within 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless..
 
• If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed initial Business Combination and reduce the public “float” of our Class A common stock or public warrants.
 
• Since our sponsors, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial Business Combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular Business Combination target is appropriate for our initial Business Combination.
 
• If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial Business Combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for submitting or tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.
 
• Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for Business Combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.

• If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the 24 months after the closing of this offering, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsors, their affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to complete our initial Business Combination.
 
• You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.
 
• You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.
 
• If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock.
 
• Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
