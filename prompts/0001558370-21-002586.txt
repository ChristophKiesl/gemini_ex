Satellite Services
Loral has one operating segment consisting of satellite-based communications services. Loral participates in satellite services operations primarily through its ownership interest in Telesat, a leading global satellite operator. Telesat provides its satellite and communication services from a fleet of satellites in geosynchronous (“GEO”) orbit that occupy Canadian and other orbital locations. Telesat is also developing a planned global constellation of low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellites known as “Telesat Lightspeed.” Loral held a 62.6% economic interest and a 32.6% voting interest in Telesat as of December 31, 2020.
Overview of Telesat’s GEO Satellite Business

Telesat owns and leases a satellite fleet that operates in geostationary orbit, approximately 22,000 miles above the equator. In this orbit, satellites remain in a fixed position relative to points on the earth’s surface and provide reliable, high-bandwidth services anywhere in their coverage areas, serving as the backbone for many forms of telecommunications.
​
At December 31, 2020, Telesat, with approximately $2.1 billion of backlog, provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of 15 in-orbit geostationary satellites and the Canadian Ka-band payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite. Telesat provides video distribution and direct-to-home (“DTH”) video, as well as end-to-end communications services using both satellite and hybrid satellite-ground networks.
Telesat’s GEO satellite fleet offers global coverage with a concentration over the Americas. Telesat has a leading position in the North American satellite video distribution market. Telesat’s GEO satellite fleet and ground infrastructure provide a platform supporting (i) strong video distribution and DTH neighborhoods in North America with blue chip customers and significant contracted backlog, and (ii) connectivity satellite services for customers around the world for backhaul, corporate networks, maritime and aero services, and video distribution and contribution.

Telesat offers its suite of GEO satellite services to more than 400 customers worldwide, which include some of the world’s leading DTH service providers, ISPs, network service integrators, telecommunications carriers, corporations and government agencies. Telesat has established long-term, collaborative relationships with its customers and has developed a reputation for innovation, reliability, and outstanding customer service.

In addition, the orbital locations occupied by Telesat’s GEO satellites provide Telesat with an advantageous position in the markets in which Telesat operates due to the scarcity of available satellite spectrum and the strong neighborhoods Telesat has developed at these locations. As such, Telesat believes its global satellite fleet, access to desirable orbital locations and spectrum rights and strong relationships with its customers position Telesat to maintain its industry leading position as a provider of GEO satellite services, generate significant and predictable cash flows, and capitalize on the growth drivers in the satellite industry and the markets Telesat serves.

Telesat Lightspeed
​
After decades of developing and successfully operating its GEO satellite services business, Telesat has commenced the development of what it believes will be the world’s most advanced constellation of LEO satellites and integrated terrestrial infrastructure, called “Telesat Lightspeed” — a platform designed to revolutionize the provision of global broadband connectivity. LEO satellites operate in a circular orbit around the earth with an altitude typically between 500 and 870 miles. Unlike geostationary satellites that operate in a fixed orbital location above the equator, LEO satellites travel around the earth at high velocities requiring antennas on the ground to track their movement. LEO satellite systems have the potential to offer a number of advantages over geostationary satellites to meet growing requirements for broadband services, both consumer and commercial, by providing increased data speeds and capacity, global coverage, and latency on par with or potentially better than terrestrial services.
​
Telesat Lightspeed has the potential to transform global satellite and terrestrial communications industries, dramatically increasing Telesat’s addressable market from approximately US$18 billion to approximately US$365 billion and significantly expanding its growth potential. Telesat seeks to benefit from its historically strong and stable GEO-based satellite business and, by continuing to develop and deploy Telesat Lightspeed, capitalize on the growing demand for global broadband connectivity.
​
Telesat has been developing Telesat Lightspeed with industry-leading partners for over five years in order to optimize and de-risk Lightspeed’s performance. Telesat Lightspeed has been optimized to serve the fast-growing broadband connectivity requirements of fixed and mobile network operators, aeronautical and maritime users, enterprise customers and governments. Telesat expects to begin launching the first Telesat Lightspeed satellites in approximately two years, with customer beta testing beginning shortly thereafter and commercial services commencing in the second half of 2023.

Telesat Lightspeed is expected to consist of 298 state-of-the-art interconnected LEO satellites coupled with a sophisticated and integrated terrestrial infrastructure to create a fiber-like broadband network for commercial and government users worldwide. Telesat’s fleet is expected to be composed of 78 polar-orbit satellites and 220 inclined-orbit satellites, providing full global coverage but concentrating capacity over geographic regions of highest demand. Additional satellites and ground facilities can be added to the network to meet increased user demand as and when required.

In January 2018, Telesat’s first LEO satellite was successfully launched into orbit. This Phase 1 LEO satellite has demonstrated certain key features of the Telesat Lightspeed system design, specifically the capability of the satellite and customer terminals to deliver a low latency broadband experience. Telesat also installed ground infrastructure at Telesat’s teleport in Allan Park in Canada to support testing with a variety of existing and prospective customers and potential suppliers of the Telesat Lightspeed system hardware who have been participating in trials since the second half of 2018. Telesat has received positive feedback from customers.

In February 2021, Telesat announced that Telesat entered into an agreement with Thales Alenia Space (“TAS”) to be the prime manufacturer of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation and that TAS and its affiliate Telespazio have made a Lightspeed capacity commitment in connection with the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties have provided for continued progress of the program while the financing for the project is being finalized. The execution of the definitive manufacturing agreement, the commencement of full construction activities and the final constellation deployment schedule are subject to, and conditional upon, the progress of the financing for the program.
​
In February 2021, Telesat announced that it had selected MDA Communications Holdings, Inc. (“MDA”) to manufacture the phased array antennas to be incorporated into the Telesat Lightspeed satellites. Under the terms of the agreement Telesat has entered into with MDA, the parties have provided for continued progress of the program while the financing for the project is being finalized.
​
In February 2021, Telesat announced that Telesat entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with the government of Québec for an investment of CAD 400 million into Telesat Lightspeed. Under the terms of the MOU, the investment by the government of Québec will consist of CAD 200 million in preferred equity as well as a CAD 200 million loan. It is expected that a final agreement will be completed in the coming months.

Telesat continues to take a number of steps to continue to progress the Telesat Lightspeed business plan, including putting in place arrangements with launch providers, ground systems operators, and antenna manufacturers (to advance the development of economical and high efficiency antenna systems).

Telesat currently estimates that Telesat Lightspeed will require a capital investment of approximately $5 billion. Telesat anticipates diverse sources of financing to fund the development of Telesat Lightspeed, including (subject to compliance with Telesat’s borrowing covenants) Telesat’s current cash-on-hand, expected cash flows of Telesat’s GEO business, proceeds Telesat expects to receive from the repurposing of C-band spectrum, potential future equity issuance, and future borrowings, including from export credit agencies.

The following competitive strengths characterize Telesat’s business and provide a strong foundation for Telesat Lightspeed:

Telesat is a Leading Global Satellite Operator with 50+ Years of Heritage and a Blue Chip Customer Base

Telesat is a leading global satellite operator with over 50 years of operating experience. Telesat’s state-of-the-art GEO satellite fleet is comprised of 15 satellites and offers global satellite coverage with a concentration over the Americas. Through its deep commitment to customer service and focus on innovation and engineering excellence, Telesat developed strong and long-standing relationships with a diverse range of high-quality, blue chip customers globally. Telesat’s top ten customers have relied on Telesat for an average of 30 years, which Telesat believes is a testament to its outstanding customer service, innovative offerings and deep technical expertise.
Telesat Industry-Leading Engineering Expertise Driving Continuous Innovation

Telesat believes it has an unrivalled track-record of innovation, “firsts,” and commercial success in the global satellite industry, guided by one of the most experienced management teams in the industry. Telesat’s deep technical expertise and commercial focus has enabled Telesat to pioneer many of the industry’s most groundbreaking innovations. Telesat’s engineering excellence is also evidenced in part through its industry-leading satellite consulting activities. To date, Telesat has provided technical support to the development of more than 100 satellite systems for roughly 30 commercial and government customers worldwide, including expertise in satellite design, construction and launch. Telesat believes its accumulated experience and expertise in the design, procurement, launch, operation and commercialization of satellites is unparalleled and will continue to drive Telesat’s innovation into the future.
​
Telesat Portfolio of Strategic and Valuable Orbital Real Estate

Telesat’s GEO satellites occupy orbital locations that provide Telesat with an advantageous position in the markets in which it operates due to the scarcity of available satellite spectrum and the strong neighborhoods Telesat has developed at these locations. Access to these orbital locations, coupled with the high capital intensity of the satellite industry, creates barriers to entry in those markets. Telesat is licensed by the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (“ISED”) to occupy a number of key orbital locations that are well-suited to serve the Americas and support Telesat’s leading position in North America. Internationally, Telesat’s satellites occupy advantageous orbital locations that enable broad pan-regional service with interconnectivity between regions, promoting both intra- and inter- regional services. Telesat also has rights to additional spectrum, including at certain existing orbital locations.
​
Telesat has decades of experience in obtaining and maintaining the licenses and approvals required to operate its existing global satellite and ground station network. As such, Telesat is well positioned to obtain the regulatory approvals required to launch and operate Telesat Lightspeed consistent with Telesat’s commercial and financial objectives. Telesat has secured a license from the government of Canada to launch and operate a LEO satellite constellation using ~4 GHz of Ka-band spectrum, which has priority rights at the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”). Ka-band spectrum is particularly well suited for high performance global broadband networks because it allows wider bandwidth, high data and efficient frequency reuse for user-beam services, as well as the feeder-link beams required to connect the satellites to landing stations. In general, Telesat’s ITU priority requires other LEO systems to ensure that they do not create interference for Telesat Lightspeed. This should allow Telesat Lightspeed to operate as designed, while requiring other systems to take measures, which may adversely impact their operating capabilities, to avoid interfering with Telesat Lightspeed operations. Telesat has also received other licenses and approvals for Telesat Lightspeed and is pursuing a market access plan in priority countries on a global basis.
​
Telesat also has rights to use C-band spectrum, which is also a critical spectrum band for 5G. This spectrum is currently the subject of regulatory proceedings in the United States and Canada, where a portion of this spectrum is being repurposed from satellite use to terrestrial wireless use. In the United States proceeding, Telesat has been awarded $344.4 million in accelerated clearing payments if Telesat undertakes certain tasks by specified deadlines. Telesat may also be eligible to receive funds to clear C-band spectrum in other countries, such as Canada, that would further strengthen Telesat’s financial position and enhance its ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities, such as deployment of Telesat Lightspeed.

Telesat Uniquely Positioned to Revolutionize Global Broadband Connectivity with Telesat Lightspeed

Telesat is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the provision of global broadband internet connectivity with Telesat Lightspeed, which Telesat believes will be one of the most advanced constellations of LEO satellites and integrated terrestrial infrastructure ever conceived. Telesat’s patent-pending LEO architecture is designed to offer an unparalleled combination of capacity, speed, security, reach, resiliency and affordability, with low latency that is on par with the most advanced terrestrial networks. Telesat has secured global priority spectrum rights in Ka-band and has strong government support, including an anchor contract with the government of Canada that Telesat believes will result in CAD 1.2 billion of revenue over 10 years. Telesat’s strong position with Telesat Lightspeed is underpinned, and made possible, by Telesat’s decades of deep commercial, technical, operational and regulatory experience and expertise in the global satellite services market, as well as its long- standing customer relationships.
Telesat Contracted Revenue Backlog and Disciplined Management Supports Strong Revenue Visibility
Because of the mission-critical nature of Telesat’s services and long-term contractual agreements, Telesat has highly recurring revenue from its customers, which provides significant revenue visibility. For the last three years Telesat has had, on average, 81% of each year’s total revenue already under contract at the beginning of the year. Telesat contracted revenue backlog of $2.1 billion for Telesat’s GEO business as of December 31, 2020 represents a multiple of approximately 3.3 times revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. One hundred percent of Telesat’s backlog is non-cancellable or cancellable on economically prohibitive terms. Approximately 47% of Telesat’s revenue is derived from North American DTH customers who signed long-term (~15 years) contracts. Roughly half of Telesat’s revenue is derived from providing vital connectivity services to companies that Telesat has served for decades, including telecommunication companies, mobile network operators, users in the aeronautical and maritime markets, energy and natural resource companies, and governments. As demand for affordable, secure and reliable broadband connectivity continues to increase, Telesat expects that demand for these services from these and similar customers will continue to grow.
Telesat’s Growth Strategy
Telesat plans to grow its business and profitability by supporting its existing customers and services and by developing and deploying Telesat Lightspeed. Telesat Lightspeed is a highly advanced, global, enterprise-grade, integrated satellite and terrestrial network optimized to capture the growing demand for broadband connectivity in certain key market verticals around the world. Core to Telesat’s growth strategy is leveraging Telesat’s longstanding customer relationships, deep technical, operating and regulatory expertise and culture of outstanding customer service and continuous innovation.
The principal elements of Telesat’s growth strategy are the following:
Follow a Disciplined GEO Satellite Operating and Expansion Strategy
Telesat will continue to focus on increasing the utilization of its existing GEO satellite capacity, maintaining operating efficiency and, in a disciplined manner, using its strong cash flows to strengthen its business. Telesat will continue to be disciplined in its satellite replacement and expansion program, seeking to secure high-quality, long-term customers to anchor any new or replacement geostationary satellites in advance of committing to the construction of such satellites. Many of Telesat’s customer service contracts are multi-year in duration and, in the past, Telesat has successfully contracted all or a significant portion of a satellite’s capacity prior to commencing construction. For example, in 2017, Telesat announced that Bell Canada signed a 15-year contract for substantially all of the high-throughput satellite (“HTS”) spot beam capacity over northern Canada on Telesat’s new Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellite. The capacity was used to dramatically enhance broadband connectivity for communities in Nunavut, Canada’s northernmost territory.
​

Capture the Explosive Demand for Global Broadband Connectivity with Telesat Lightspeed
Telesat Lightspeed has been designed to provide fast, affordable, reliable and secure broadband connectivity everywhere on Earth, giving Telesat and its customers a significant competitive advantage in the markets Telesat serves. The network design is optimized to serve users that require fiber-like connectivity beyond the reach of high capacity terrestrial networks. Telesat’s advanced constellation design, patent-pending LEO architecture, global priority spectrum rights, strong government support and decades of deep commercial, technical, operational and regulatory experience has put Telesat in a strong position to capture the growing demand for affordable, high capacity broadband connectivity around the world.
Leverage Valuable Spectrum Rights to Support Investment in Growth Initiatives
Telesat has an opportunity to leverage its valuable spectrum rights (in particular, rights to C-band spectrum) in order to generate funds that can be used to support investment in strategic growth initiatives. On February 28, 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) in the United States issued a final Report and Order on Expanding Flexible use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band. The Report and Order provided that Telesat would receive as much as $344.4 million from the repurposing of C-band spectrum in the United States provided that Telesat takes the necessary actions to move Telesat’s services in the continental United States out of the 3700 — 4000 MHz spectrum band and into the 4000 — 4200 MHz band and take the necessary steps to ensure that Telesat’s end user antennas will not be subject to terrestrial interference. Telesat believes that it can meet all the requirements to receive the $344.4 million.
​
A similar repurposing of C-band spectrum is currently underway in Canada as well, with the government of Canada launching a public consultation on repurposing C-band spectrum in August 2020. In the consultation document, in addition to its own proposal, the government of Canada included a proposal Telesat put forward whereby, as the sole satellite operator licensed to use C-band in Canada, Telesat would accelerate, and be fully responsible for, the clearing of a portion of the C-band spectrum for 5G. In return, Telesat would be compensated for clearing and repurposing the spectrum. Comments were submitted to the government on October 26, 2020, and Reply Comments were submitted on November 30, 2020. Telesat anticipates a decision in 2021.

Opportunistically Engage in M&A Activity to Enhance Competitive Position and Shareholder Value

The satellite industry has, historically, undergone periods of consolidation, both horizontal and vertical.

Recently, two large satellite operators have each acquired a large service provider. A number of satellite operators have also publicly discussed the benefit of, and potential for, consolidation among satellite operators. Thus, there may be another period of horizontal, as well as continued vertical, consolidation in this sector.
 ​
In addition, at this time, the industry is dynamic with some new non-traditional players entering the market. Telesat will be alert to, and will evaluate, merger and acquisition opportunities in a thoughtful and disciplined manner as they arise with the aim of enhancing its competitive position and shareholder value.

Competition
​
Telesat competes against other global, regional and national satellite operators and with providers of terrestrial-based communications services.

Telesat is a leading global satellite operator. Other scaled, global satellite operators include Intelsat S.A. (“Intelsat”), SES S.A. (“SES”), Eutelsat S.A. (“Eutelsat”), and Inmarsat. Telesat also competes against a number of nationally or regionally focused satellite operators around the world. Telesat competes with these operators based primarily on the quality of its services, location of its orbital slots, performance characteristics of Telesat satellites, price, and overall client needs.

The other major LEO satellite systems that have been announced to date are (i) OneWeb, (ii) SpaceX Starlink, and (iii) Amazon Kuiper. Telesat believes that the innovative architecture and advanced technology of Telesat Lightspeed will allow Telesat to compete effectively against any of the other proposed systems.

Telesat believes the combination of the following attributes positions Telesat highly favorably to commercialize Telesat Lightspeed successfully, notwithstanding Telesat’s competitors in the LEO marketplace:
​
Enterprise-grade system: Telesat Lightspeed is focused on enterprise solutions and optimized for that purpose. Telesat’s constellation design, features and functionality will be the most compelling satellite-based enterprise grade network in the world.
​
Vast technical expertise, experience and relationships: As a trusted satellite operator with a highly experienced management team, Telesat has longstanding relationships at the most important levels of the industry (e.g., customers, suppliers and regulators), and an established eco-system of partners to design a technologically-advanced and economical ground infrastructure. By comparison, competitive LEO services are each being offered by a new market entrant with little experience in developing, deploying and operating satellite networks or in providing satellite communication services.

Existing, engaged customer base: Telesat is known and trusted by key customers and has a deep understanding of their requirements. Over 400 telecommunications, enterprise and government customers today rely on Telesat to help plan their future mission critical infrastructure needs.
​
Global regulatory experience: Regulatory compliance is a critical aspect of operating and commercializing a satellite network. Obtaining rights to use spectrum and to gain access to provide service in countries around the world is a complex process. National governments have viewed space, and access to their markets from space, as a critical asset and insist on compliance with their regulations. The framework for non-geostationary orbit (“NGSO”) spectrum rights, both at an individual country level and internationally at the ITU, is evolving, and it is critical to be an active participant in, and have deep knowledge of, these processes. Telesat has extensive experience in all of these areas, as well as credibility with regulators and other industry participants. This has been, and will continue to be, an important competitive advantage for Telesat versus those companies that do not have the same experience as Telesat. 

Priority spectrum rights: Telesat’s ITU priority generally requires other LEO systems to ensure that they do not create interference for Telesat Lightspeed. This should allow Telesat Lightspeed to operate as designed, while requiring other systems to take measures to avoid interfering with Telesat Lightspeed operations, which may adversely impact their operating capabilities. The only country, to date, that has enacted an approach to how constellations coordinate their operations that does not follow the ITU process is the United States. In the United States, the FCC has enacted a rule that requires satellite operators whose license or market access was granted in the first processing round (as is the case for Telesat, SpaceX and OneWeb) to split spectrum in certain circumstances. Under the FCC rules, as the first operator to launch a Ka-band LEO satellite, Telesat should be able to choose which portion of the spectrum it will use. Amazon’s Kuiper system was granted its license in the second processing round and, therefore, must operate on a non-interference basis with respect to all systems granted license or market access in the first processing round.
​
Strong government support: As part of Canada’s commitment to bridge the digital divide inside its borders, Telesat has entered into a partnership with the government of Canada to bring affordable, high-speed internet connectivity across rural, underserved areas of Canada. The partnership is expected to generate CAD1.2 billion in revenue for Telesat over ten years, which includes up to CAD 600 million from the government of Canada. Additionally, the government of Canada will contribute up to CAD 85 million to Telesat through the government of Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund (“SIF”), and Telesat continues to work closely with other provincial, territorial and local governments across Canada —as well as other key regions globally — to support government focus on this goal.

(1) | Telesat’s current estimate of when each satellite will be decommissioned, taking account of anomalies and malfunctions the satellites have experienced to date and other factors such as remaining fuel levels, consumption rates and other available engineering data. These estimates are subject to change and it is possible that the actual orbital maneuver life of any of these satellites will be different from that which Telesat currently anticipates. Further, it is anticipated that the payload capacity of each satellite may be reduced prior to the estimated end of orbital maneuver life. For example, Telesat currently anticipates that Telesat will need to commence the turndown of transponders on Anik F1 prior to the end of orbital maneuver life, as a result of further degradation in available power.

We own 56% of XTAR a joint venture between us and Hisdesat Servicios Estrategicos, S.A. (“Hisdesat”) of Spain. Prior to July 1, 2020, XTAR owned and operated an X-band satellite, XTAR–EUR (the “Satellite”), located at the 29° E.L. orbital slot (the “Orbital Slot”). In addition, prior to July 1, 2020, XTAR leased from Hisdesat 7.2 72MHz X-band transponders on the Spainsat satellite located at 30° W.L. (the “Transponder Lease”). For services provided by Loral, XTAR, until December 31, 2013, was charged a quarterly management fee under a management agreement with Loral (the “Loral Management Agreement”). As of December 31, 2019, the amount due to Loral under the Loral Management Agreement was $6.6 million, and we had an allowance of $6.6 million against this receivable. 
​
On July 1, 2020, Loral, XTAR and Hisdesat restructured their relationship, including, among other things, the following: (i) Hisdesat purchased the Satellite and certain assets related to operation of the Satellite (the “Purchased Assets”) from XTAR; (ii) XTAR’s agreement with Hisdesat to operate the Satellite at the Orbital Slot was terminated and the rights and licenses to operate the Satellite at the Orbital Slot reverted to Hisdesat; (iii) the Transponder Lease was terminated; (iv) XTAR and Hisdesat entered into an agreement under which XTAR will continue to market and sell capacity on the Satellite and on the Spainsat satellite; (v) XTAR and Loral terminated the Loral Management Agreement; and (vi) Loral granted to Hisdesat an option to acquire for nominal consideration, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals, Loral’s membership interests in XTAR. This option has not yet been exercised by Hisdesat. On July 2, 2020, Loral received from XTAR $5.9 million from the proceeds of the sale of the Purchased Assets in full and final settlement of the past due receivable outstanding of $6.6 million under the Loral Management Agreement. As a result, the Company recorded a $5.9 million recovery of an affiliate doubtful receivable and a corresponding reduction in its allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2020.

REGULATION
​
Telesat is subject to regulation by government authorities in Canada, the United States and other countries in which it operates and is subject to the frequency coordination process of the ITU. Telesat’s ability to provide satellite services in a particular country or region is subject also to the technical constraints of its satellites, international coordination, local regulation including as it applies to securing landing rights and licensing requirements.
​
Canadian Regulatory Environment
​
Telesat was originally established by the government of Canada in 1969 under the Telesat Canada Act. As part of the Canadian government’s divestiture of its shares in Telesat, pursuant to the Telesat Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act (1991), or the Telesat Divestiture Act, Telesat was continued on March 27, 1992 as a business corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Telesat Canada Act was repealed and the Canadian government sold its shares in Telesat. The Telesat Divestiture Act provides that no legislation relating to the solvency or winding-up of a corporation applies to Telesat and that its affairs cannot be wound up unless authorized by an Act of Parliament. In addition, Telesat and its shareholders and directors cannot apply for Telesat’s continuation in another jurisdiction or dissolution unless authorized by an Act of Parliament.
​
Telesat is a Canadian carrier under the Telecommunications Act (Canada), or the Telecom Act. The Telecom Act authorizes the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) to regulate various aspects of the provision of telecommunications services by Telesat and other telecommunications service providers. Telesat is currently not subject to detailed rate regulation; the CRTC has, however, retained its powers under the Telecom Act to impose price regulation or other regulatory measures on Telesat in the future, as necessary. In addition, Section 28(2) of the Telecom Act provides that the CRTC may allocate satellite capacity to particular broadcasting undertakings if it is satisfied that the allocation will further the implementation of the broadcasting policy for Canada. 
​
Telesat’s operations are also subject to regulation and licensing by ISED (formerly Industry Canada) pursuant to the Radiocommunication Act (Canada). ISED has the authority to issue spectrum and earth station licenses and establish policies and standards related to the radio frequencies upon which Telesat’s satellites and earth stations depend. The Minister responsible for ISED has broad discretion in exercising this authority to issue licenses, fix and amend conditions of licenses and to suspend or even revoke them. Some of the spectrum licenses under which Telesat operates the Anik and Nimiq satellites require Telesat to comply with research and development and other industrial and public benefit commitments, to pay annual spectrum license fees and to provide all-Canada satellite coverage.
​
ISED traditionally licensed satellite radio spectrum using a competitive licensing process. In 2012, ISED conducted a public consultation on the licensing framework for fixed satellite service (“FSS”) and broadcasting satellite service (“BSS”) in Canada. As a result, effective January 6, 2014, all FSS and BSS licenses are awarded to qualified applicants on a first-come, first-served basis, and spectrum licenses have replaced radio licenses. The term of spectrum licenses is 20 years, with a high expectation of renewal. ISED may, however, issue licenses with a shorter term. Spectrum licenses include standard conditions of license, including milestones for construction, launch and deployment of satellite(s).

ISED is considering reallocating a portion of the C-band frequencies to terrestrial mobile 5G. As a result, Telesat may be required to vacate a portion of the C-band in the future. Satellite and terrestrial operators are seeking additional spectrum to accommodate the expected growth in demand for broadband services and 5G networks. ISED is considering and may adopt new spectrum allocations for terrestrial services that require satellite operators to vacate or share spectrum. 

The Canadian government opened Canadian satellite markets to foreign satellite operators as part of its 1998 World Trade Organization (“WTO”) commitments to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services, with the exception of DTH television services provided through FSS or direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) facilities. In September 2005, the Canadian government revised its satellite-use policy to permit the use of foreign-licensed satellites for digital audio radio services in Canada.

​

17



Since November 2000, pursuant to the CRTC’s Decision CRTC 2000-745, virtually all telecommunications service providers are required to pay contribution charges, which are fees paid into a central fund used to support the provision of video relay service, and to subsidize the cost of providing telephone and broadband service in underserved and high-cost serving areas. The charges payable by a telecom service provider are calculated as a percentage of its Canadian telecommunications service revenues, minus certain deductions (e.g., terminal equipment sales and inter-carrier payments). The rate for 2020 is 0.44%. An interim rate also of 0.44% has been established by the CRTC for 2021.

United States Regulatory Environment

The FCC regulates the provision of satellite services to, from, or within the United States

Telesat’s U.S. licensed satellites operate on a non-common carrier basis. Consequently, they are not subject to rate regulation or other common carrier regulations enacted under the Communications Act of 1934. Telesat pays FCC filing fees in connection with Telesat’s space station and earth station applications and annual license and market fees to defray the FCC’s regulatory expenses. Telesat is part of a coalition that has challenged the FCC’s recent extension of regulatory fees to satellites for which U.S. market access has been granted, but it remains in effect during the pendency of the court challenge. Annual and quarterly reports must be filed with the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) covering interstate/international telecommunications revenues. Based on these reports, USAC assesses Telesat for contributions to the FCC’s Universal Service Fund (“USF”). Payments to the USF are made on a quarterly and annual basis. The USF contribution rate is adjusted quarterly and is set at 31.8% for the first quarter of 2021. At the present time, the FCC does not assess USF contributions with respect to bare transponder capacity (i.e., agreements for space segment only).

The FCC currently grants geostationary-like satellite authorizations on a first-come, first-served basis to applicants which demonstrate that they are legally and technically qualified and that the public interest will be served by the grant. In contrast, applications for non-geostationary-like satellite authorizations are generally dealt with through processing rounds, initiated by public notice or the submission of a lead application. To facilitate the provision of FSS in C-, Ku-, Ka- and V-band frequencies in the United States market, foreign licensed operators can apply to have their satellites either placed on the FCC’s Permitted Space Station List (for certain frequencies) or be granted a declaratory ruling (for other frequencies). Grants include conditions of license including deployment milestones. If more than one non-geostationary system intends to use the same frequencies, coordination is required; however, if coordination cannot be reached, the U.S rules require that band splitting be applied. Under licensing and market access rules, a bond must be posted, starting at $1 million when a geostationary satellite or non-geostationary satellite constellation authorization is granted and escalating to up to $3 million in the case of a geostationary satellite and $5 million in the case of a non-geostationary satellite constellation. The entire amount of the bond may be forfeited if there is a failure to meet the FCC’s milestones for the launch and commencement of operations of the geostationary satellite or the milestones for the deployment and operation of 50% of the satellites in a non-geostationary satellite constellation. The bond and milestone requirements for U.S.-licensed satellites apply equally to authorized foreign-licensed satellites. According to current licensing rules and policies, the FCC will issue new satellite licenses for an initial 15-year term and will provide a licensee with an “expectancy” that a subsequent license will be granted for the replacement of an authorized geostationary satellite using the same frequencies. At the end of the 15-year term, a geostationary satellite that has not been replaced, or that has been relocated to another orbital location following its replacement, may be allowed to continue operations for a limited period of time subject to certain restrictions.

The FCC has reallocated a portion of the C-band frequencies to terrestrial mobile 5G. As a result, Telesat will be compensated to vacate a portion of the C-band by December 31, 2023. As in other jurisdictions, the FCC is considering and may adopt new spectrum allocations for terrestrial mobile broadband and 5G, including in bands that are currently allocated to satellite services.

The United States made no WTO commitment to open its DTH, DBS or digital audio radio services to foreign competition, and instead indicated that the provision of these services by foreign operators would be considered on a case-by-case basis, based on an evaluation of the effective competitive opportunities open to the United States operators in the country in which the foreign satellite was licensed (“ECO-sat test”) as well as other public interest criteria. While Canada currently does not satisfy the ECO-sat test in the case of DTH and DBS service, the FCC has found, in a number of cases, that provision of these services into the United States using Canadian-licensed satellites would provide significant public interest benefits and would therefore be allowed. In cases involving Telesat, United States service providers Digital Broadband Applications Corp., DIRECTV and EchoStar have all received FCC approval to access Canadian-authorized satellites under Telesat’s direction and control in Canadian-licensed orbital locations to provide DTH-FSS or DBS service into the United States.

The approval of the FCC for the Telesat Acquisition and the Skynet Transaction was conditioned upon Telesat’s compliance with commitments made to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security relating to the availability of certain records and communications in the United States in response to lawful United States law enforcement requests for such access.

The export of United States-manufactured satellites and technical information related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services to certain countries are subject to State Department, Commerce Department and Treasury Department regulations.

In 1999, the United States State Department published amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), which included satellites on the list of items requiring export licenses. Effective November 2014, further amendments to the ITAR transferred jurisdiction of certain satellites and related technology to the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department, which also impose license requirements in specified circumstances.

Regulation Outside Canada and the United States
The Brazilian national telecommunications agency, ANATEL, grants exploitation rights for Brazilian satellites to companies incorporated and existing in Brazil. Until October 2019, these exploitation rights were granted to companies which participated in specific auctions conducted by ANATEL. Such requirement of specific auctions was abolished by Federal Law No. 13,879, dated October 3, 2019, which amended the Brazilian General Telecommunications Law. The auction process was replaced by a simpler administrative process to be determined by ANATEL. Under this administrative process, interested companies will continue to be required to demonstrate that they are legally, technically and financially qualified and that the public interest will be served by the grant. ANATEL may also grant exploitation and landing rights for foreign satellites when the public interest is evidenced, provided that the applicant company provides certain specific technical information on the relevant satellite and appoints a legal representative in Brazil (i.e., a company incorporated and existing in Brazil). The landing rights of foreign satellites will be granted to the owner of the space segment or the company which holds the right to operate it, in whole or in part, but the satellite capacity may only be commercialized in Brazil through the local legal representative. In exploitation and landing rights of Brazilian satellites, the rights are granted conditional on payment of applicable fees (payment may be converted into investment commitments) and are valid for up to 15 years (renewable for additional periods provided that the obligations already assumed are fulfilled). In exploitation and landing rights of foreign satellites, the rights are granted conditional on payment of applicable fees and are valid for up to 15 years renewable once for an additional equal period.

ANATEL has authorized Telesat, through its subsidiary, Telesat Brasil Capacidade de Satélites Ltda. (“TBCS”), to operate FSS satellites at the 63° WL orbital location. In December 2008, TBCS entered into a new 15-year Concession Agreement with ANATEL which obligates TBCS to operate a Ku-band satellite in accordance with Brazilian telecommunications law and contains provisions to enable ANATEL to levy fines for failure to perform according to the Concession Agreement terms. In May 2015, TBCS was the successful bidder in an ANATEL auction for Ka-Band and planned Ku-band frequency rights at the 63° WL orbital location and the associated 15-year Concession Agreements were signed on March 2, 2016. Telesat’s Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites are located at 63° WL and make use of these frequency rights.

In addition, ANATEL has accredited TBCS as legal representative in Brazil of two non-Brazilian satellites: Telstar 12 VANTAGE and Anik G1.

19



Telesat owns the Telstar 18 VANTAGE satellite, which currently operates at the 138° EL orbital location under an agreement with APT. APT has been granted the right to use the C- and Ku-band frequencies at the 138° EL orbital location by The Kingdom of Tonga. APT is the direct interface with the Tonga regulatory bodies. Because Telesat gained access to this orbital location through APT, there is greater uncertainty with respect to Telesat’s ability to maintain access to this orbital location and the frequencies.
​
 Telesat owns and operates the portion of the ViaSat-1 satellite (115° WL) payload that is capable of providing service within Canada. ViaSat-1 operates in accordance with a license granted by the FCC in the United States. However, by virtue of an intergovernmental arrangement between the United States and the United Kingdom, ViaSat-1 operates in accordance with ITU networks filed by the United Kingdom regulatory agency, OFCOM, on behalf of the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency and Isle of Man satellite frequency filings are filed with the ITU by OFCOM. ManSat Ltd. (“ManSat”) has been granted rights by the Isle of Man government to manage all aspects of Isle of Man satellite frequency filings. Both Telesat and ViaSat have a commercial relationship with ManSat. ViaSat and Telesat have agreed to cooperate in their dealings with ManSat with respect to the ViaSat-1 satellite for OFCOM and ITU purposes. The Ka-band and portions of the Ku-band frequencies on Telstar 12 VANTAGE, portions of the Ka-band frequencies on Telstar 18 VANTAGE and the Ka-band frequencies on Telstar 19 VANTAGE, are also filed with the ITU by ManSat on behalf of Telesat.

Landing Rights and Other Regulatory Requirements

Many countries regulate satellite transmission signals to, and for uplink signals from, their territory. Telesat has landing rights in major market countries worldwide. In many jurisdictions, landing rights are granted on a per-satellite basis and applications must be made to secure landing rights on replacement satellites.
International Regulatory Environment -- International Telecommunication Union 

The ITU, a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for administering access by member states to frequencies in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The ITU Radio Regulations set forth the process that member states must follow to secure rights for geostationary satellite networks and non-geostationary satellite systems to use frequencies and the obligations and restrictions that govern such use. The process includes, for example, a “first-come, first-served” system for gaining access to certain frequencies, time limits for bringing the frequencies into use by launching one satellite, and in the case of non-geostationary satellite systems, milestones associated with the deployment of additional satellites in the system. In the case of geostationary satellite networks only, certain frequencies at specified orbital locations have been reserved in perpetuity for individual administrations’ use.

Canada, the United States and other member states have rights to use certain frequencies. Telesat has been authorized by its ITU filing administrators (Canada, USA, Brazil, United Kingdom and Northern Ireland) to use certain frequencies. In addition, through commercial arrangements, Telesat has the right to use certain frequencies for which the Kingdom of Tonga has the rights. Authorized frequencies include those already used by Telesat’s current satellites, and additional frequencies at various geostationary orbital locations or in non-geostationary constellations that must be brought into use within specified time limits.

The ITU Radio Regulations govern the process used by satellite operators to coordinate their operations with other satellite operators to avoid harmful interference. Each member state is required to give notice of, coordinate and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments with the ITU. The filing and registration process is administered by the ITU Radiocommunications Bureau (the “ITU-BR”).

Once a member state has filed its proposed use of frequencies with the ITU, other member states inform that member state and the ITU-BR of any intended use that has the potential to cause interference to either existing operations, or operations that may occur in accordance with priority rights. The member states are then obligated to negotiate with each other in an effort to coordinate the proposed uses and resolve interference concerns. If all outstanding issues are resolved in accordance with the various procedures of the ITU Radio Regulations, the frequencies are entered into the ITU’s Master International Frequency Register (“MIFR”). Registered frequencies are entitled under international law to interference protection from subsequent or nonconforming uses.

20



Under the ITU Radio Regulations, a member state that places a satellite or any ground station into operation without completing coordination could be vulnerable to interference from other systems and may have to alter the operating parameters of its satellite or ground station if harmful interference occurs to other users already entered in the MIFR or that have priority rights.

The process of ITU filing and notification in the MIFR of frequencies spans a period of seven years, or longer, depending upon the frequency band and the various provisions of the ITU Radio Regulations that may be invoked. Telesat’s authorized frequencies are in various stages of the coordination and notification process. Many frequencies have completed the process and have been registered in the MIFR. In other cases, coordination is on-going so that entry into the MIFR is pending. This is typical for satellite operators. Depending upon the outcome of coordination discussions with other satellite operators, Telesat may need to make concessions in terms of how a frequency may be used. The failure to reach an appropriate arrangement with such satellite operators may render it impossible to secure entry into the MIFR and result in substantial restrictions on the use and operations of Telesat’s existing satellites. In the event disputes arise during the coordination process or thereafter, the ITU Radio Regulations set forth procedures for resolving disputes but do not contain a mandatory dispute resolution mechanism or an enforcement mechanism. Rather, the rules invite a consensual dispute resolution process for parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Neither the rules nor international law provide a clear remedy for a party where this voluntary process fails.

Other Orbital Spectrum

Telesat has been authorized by governments to operate using additional frequencies at some of the orbital locations where Telesat is currently operating a satellite. In addition, Telesat has been authorized by governments to operate at other orbital locations where Telesat currently does not have a satellite in service as well as a global LEO constellation in Ka-band and V-band.
​
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
As of December 31, 2020, Telesat owned 23 issued patents, four of which are in the United States. These patents expire between 2025 and 2039. Telesat also has several pending domestic and international patent applications.
​
There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing pending patent applications will be issued. Moreover, there can be no assurance that infringement of existing third party patents has not occurred or will not occur. Additionally, because the patent application process is confidential, there can be no assurance that third parties, including competitors, do not have patents pending that could result in issued patents which Telesat may infringe. In such event, Telesat may be restricted from continuing the infringing activities, which could adversely affect its business, or Telesat may be required to obtain a license from a patent holder and pay royalties, which would increase the cost of doing business.
​
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
​
Telesat’s research and development expenditures are incurred for the studies associated with advanced satellite system designs and experimentation and development of space, satellite and ground communications products. This includes the planned development of Telesat Lightspeed.
