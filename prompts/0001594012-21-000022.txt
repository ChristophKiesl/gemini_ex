ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Investors Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation and the holding company for Investors Bank (the “Bank”). At December 31, 2020, the Company had 361,869,872 common stock issued and 247,929,216 outstanding. 
The Company is subject to regulation as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company neither owns nor leases any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and furniture of the Bank. The Company currently employs as officers only certain persons who are also officers of the Bank and uses the support staff of the Bank from time to time. These persons are not separately compensated by the Company. The Company may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its business in the future.    
The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey. Originally founded in 1926 as a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings and loan association, it has grown through acquisitions and internal growth, including de novo branching. In 1992, the charter was converted to a mutual savings bank and in 1997 the charter was converted to a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank in connection with a reorganization into the mutual holding company structure. In 2019, the charter was converted to a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank.
The Bank is in the business of attracting deposits from the public through its branch network and a secure online channel and borrowing funds in the wholesale markets to originate loans and to invest in securities. The Bank originates multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, one-to four- family residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, construction loans and consumer loans, the majority of which are cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. Securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations, and other securities represented 15.5% of consolidated assets at December 31, 2020. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
COVID-19 Pandemic
During 2020 and continuing into 2021, the entire country has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including social distancing guidelines, closure of non-essential businesses and shelter-at-home mandates, caused a global economic downturn. The economic downturn included an increase in unemployment and a decline in gross domestic product. Since April 2020, the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated above the pre-pandemic unemployment rate. Gross domestic product grew in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 after declining in the first and second quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy have led to actions including the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), the establishment of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and Economic Impact Payments paid directly to eligible individuals from the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds target rate by 150 basis points in March 2020. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, was enacted and included a reopening of the PPP, additional Economic Impact Payments and extension of several unemployment insurance benefit programs and other provisions of the CARES Act.
We continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, its impact on our employees, customers, communities and results of operations. During the first quarter of 2020, the majority of our corporate workforce had transitioned to working remotely and we successfully transitioned to a “limited service” branch model including drive-thru operations and ATM services, as well as in-branch services available by appointment only. During the second quarter of 2020, all of our branches resumed normal operating hours and all lobbies re-opened for our clients. In addition, a portion of our corporate workforce has returned to our corporate offices in some capacity while the remainder continue to work remotely in an effective manner. Proper protocols have been put in place in our branches and corporate offices to ensure the continued safety of our employees and customers.
As a result of the pandemic, certain borrowers are currently unable to meet their contractual payment obligations. In an effort to mitigate these effects, we have worked with our customers in offering short-term modifications in the form of a deferral of payment, or portion thereof. In the absence of other intervening factors, such short-term modifications or deferrals made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings in accordance with the CARES Act. We have also waived and reduced certain fees. While we have continued to support our customers by granting payment deferrals for those experiencing continued hardship because of the pandemic, we have also worked diligently with our customers to ensure a return to current payment status for a significant portion of our clients who have ended their deferral period. At February 14, 2021, loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately $756 million were in COVID-19 related deferment.
We have offered increased mobile deposit limits and increased customer support through our call center and bankers to further support our customers. Our continued focus on digital transformation and implementation of online account opening during 2020 has also benefited our customers. We have also waived and reduced certain fees. In addition, we have participated in government-sponsored programs including PPP and Main Street Lending. During 2020, we originated approximately $335 million of PPP loans and subsequently sold approximately $328 million of these PPP loans to a well-established SBA lender that could continue to assist our customers in the forgiveness process. We will continue to support our customers to ensure they are able to participate in government-sponsored economic relief programs.
We continue to provide support to our communities through grants from the Investors Foundation, as well as through the actions of our employees. Most notably, the Investors Foundation granted $100,000 to Stony Brook University Hospital Foundation on Long Island to support its treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 and will be providing a grant to a regional hospital to establish the Investors Bank Post-COVID Care Center to serve as both a clinical and research-based facility to support and treat post-COVID patients. The Investors Foundation made grants of approximately $4 million during 2020. In 
addition, our employees have provided meals and other support to healthcare workers and their families through the New York metro area.
Our Business Strategy
Since the Company’s initial public offering in 2005, we have transitioned from a wholesale thrift business to a retail commercial bank. This transition has been primarily accomplished by increasing the amount of our commercial loans and core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). Our transformation can be attributed to a number of factors, including organic growth, de novo branch openings, bank and branch acquisitions, as well as product expansion. We believe the attractive markets we operate in, namely, New Jersey and the greater New York metropolitan area, will continue to provide us with growth opportunities. In addition, the Bank has national exposure through our Investors eAccess online deposit platform and our equipment finance, healthcare and leveraged lending portfolios. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business, both consumer and commercial.
Opportunities through Our Attractive Markets 
The primary markets in which we have a retail presence are considered attractive banking markets within the United States, and we believe they will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow. We have expanded our retail franchise to include the suburbs of Philadelphia and the boroughs of New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. With the December 2020 agreement to acquire eight branches from Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc., we will expand our branch footprint by adding two branches in affluent Pennsylvania markets once the transaction closes in 2021. Additionally, we have strengthened our presence in our historic markets throughout New Jersey. We accomplished this expansion through de novo growth and select bank and branch acquisitions. As a result of this growth, the Bank is one of the largest banks headquartered in the state of New Jersey as measured by New Jersey deposits as of June 30, 2020. The markets in which we operate are desirable from an economic and demographic perspective as they are characterized by large and dense population centers, areas of high income households and centers of robust business and commercial activity. Our competition in these markets tends to be from out-of-state headquartered money centers and super-regional financial institutions as well as smaller, local community banks. We believe that as a locally headquartered institution, situated between these extremes, we can compete and capitalize on opportunities that exist in our market area. We continue to examine our branch network to optimize our market presence, which may include branch rationalization plans. 
Many of the counties we serve are projected to experience moderate to strong household income growth through 2026. Though slower population growth is projected for many of the counties we serve, it is important to note that these counties are densely populated. All of the counties we serve have a strong mature market and nearly all have median household incomes greater than the national median.
We face intense competition in making loans as well as attracting deposits in our market area. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, insurance companies and new technology-driven market entrants. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms and mutual funds. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. As of June 30, 2020, the latest date for which statistics are available, our market share of deposits was ranked in the top 10 of total deposits in the State of New Jersey and in the top 20 within the New York metropolitan area for all institutions. 
Diversifying the Loan Portfolio
To further diversify our loan portfolio, we have increased C&I lending by building relationships with small to medium sized companies. In recent years, we have hired a number of experienced C&I lending teams, including a team specializing in the healthcare industry, and in 2018, we acquired an equipment finance team and portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding $335 million of PPP loan originations, we originated $721 million in C&I loans. A significant portion of our C&I loans are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily on properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. In addition, we have national exposure through our equipment finance, healthcare and leveraged lending portfolios. Our Equipment Finance Group originates equipment finance loans and leases which are primarily secured by critical use assets. We have diversified our loan portfolio, as evidenced by the fact that C&I loans represent approximately 17% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2016, when C&I loans were approximately 7% of total loans. Diversifying our loan portfolio will continue to be a major focus of our business strategy going forward, however, we are mindful of concentrations as it pertains to capital. 
Deposit Strategy 
We are focused on generating relationship-based core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). As of December 31, 2020, we had core deposits of $16.81 billion, representing approximately 86% of total deposits. Core deposits are an attractive funding alternative because they are generally a more stable source of low cost funding and are less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. The percent of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits has grown to 19% at December 31, 2020. Despite intense competition for deposits, we will continue to pursue a customer-centric model to meeting their financial needs and continue to invest in branch staff training, product development, de novo branch growth based on existing market presence and acquired branches, as well as commercial deposit gathering efforts. Over the past few years we have developed a suite of commercial deposit and treasury management products, designed to appeal to small and mid-sized businesses and non-profit organizations including electronic deposit services such as mobile and remote deposit capture. 
Our deposit business has become more commercial oriented over the past few years as we attract more deposits from commercial entities, including businesses that borrow from us. The Bank is one of the largest depositories for government and municipal deposits in New Jersey, which provides us with an additional funding source. Government and municipal deposits were 28.2% of our total deposits at December 31, 2020. Our branch network, concentrated in markets with attractive demographics and a high-density population, will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow and improve our deposit base. During 2020, we saw a notable increase in our deposits as a result of the current economic environment including government stimulus and increased savings rates.
Digital Capabilities and Strategy 
In addition to our branch network, we offer online banking capabilities for consumers and small businesses. We are always looking to enhance our mobile and online banking services which allow us to serve our customers’ needs in an omnichannel environment. We offer account opening capabilities on our website and also offer online-exclusive deposit accounts through Investors eAccess, a secure online channel to attract consumer deposits nationwide. Other capabilities include Zelle® for real-time person to person payments, the ability to view personal credit scores, and online alerts. For our commercial customers, we have Small Business Online Banking and Commercial Online Banking, including robust online treasury management services.
In addition to our deposit-related digital capabilities, we continue to enhance our digital capabilities related to originating and servicing loans. We have partnered with ODX, a leading digital small business originations platform, to streamline our small business lending process. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities as a way to enhance the customer experience and deliver our products and services in a safe and secure manner.
Acquisitions 
A significant portion of our historic growth can be attributed to our acquisition strategy. Although management evaluates a number of factors when considering an acquisition, we have maintained a fundamental focus on preserving tangible book value per share. Acquisitions have provided us with the opportunity to grow our business, expand our geographic footprint and improve our financial performance. We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that may present themselves in the future while maintaining the financial and pricing discipline that we have adhered to in the past.
On December 2, 2020, we announced the signing of a definitive purchase and assumption agreement under which we will acquire the eight New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania branches of Berkshire Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc., including the assumption and acquisition of approximately $639.0 million of deposits and $308.0 million of consumer and commercial loans. Completion of the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of all regulatory approvals. 
On April 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Gold Coast Bancorp, Inc. (“Gold Coast Bancorp”) under which we acquired Gold Coast Bancorp. The acquisition included six branches in Nassau and Suffolk counties in suburban Long Island and one branch in Brooklyn, NY, as well as total assets of $535.3 million and deposits of $489.9 million.
On February 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of a $345.8 million equipment finance portfolio. The acquisition included a seven-person team of financing professionals to lead our Equipment Finance Group, which is a part of our commercial lending group and is classified within our C&I loan portfolio. 
Capital Management
Capital management is a key component of our business strategy. As of December 31, 2020, our tangible equity to asset ratio was 10.03%. We continue to manage our capital through a combination of organic growth, stock repurchases, dividends and acquisitions. Effective capital management and prudent growth allows us to effectively leverage our capital, while being mindful of tangible book value for stockholders. Since March 2015, we have repurchased 129.5 million shares totaling $1.56 billion at an average price per share of $12.07. 
We have paid continuous quarterly dividends since September 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our dividend payout ratio per share was approximately 51%. We have recently increased our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share.
Involvement in Our Communities
The Bank proudly promotes a higher quality of life in the communities it serves in New Jersey and New York through employee volunteer efforts and our Charitable Foundations. Employees are continually encouraged to become leaders in their communities and use the Bank’s support to help others. Through the Investors Charitable Foundation, established in 2005, and the Roma Charitable Foundation, which we acquired in December 2013, the Bank has contributed or committed $43.8 million in donations to enrich the lives of New Jersey and New York citizens by supporting initiatives in the arts, education, youth development, affordable housing, financial education, and health and human services. 
Community involvement is one of the principal values of the Bank and provides our staff with a meaningful ability to help others. We believe these efforts contribute to creating a culture at the Bank that promotes high employee morale while enhancing the presence of the Bank in our local markets. We continue to look for opportunities to help the communities we serve including during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Lending Activities
Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, C&I loans, construction loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer and other loans. At December 31, 2020, multi-family loans totaled $7.12 billion, or 34.1% of our total loan portfolio, commercial real estate loans totaled $4.95 billion, or 23.7% of our total loan portfolio, C&I loans totaled $3.58 billion, or 17.1% of our total loan portfolio, and construction loans totaled $404.4 million, or 2.0% of our total loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans represented $4.12 billion, or 19.7% of our total loans at December 31, 2020. We also offer consumer loans, which consist primarily of cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2020, consumer and other loans totaled $702.8 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio.
Our lending strategy at the beginning of 2020 was to continue to diversify our portfolio out of residential and multi-family loans and into higher-yielding C&I loans. This strategy was impacted by the low interest rate environment that began in March 2020, which led to an acceleration of loan prepayments during 2020. As a result of our strategy, the low rate environment during 2020 and the effects of the pandemic, our net loans decreased $895.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, which was driven by a decline in residential loans of $1.02 billion and a decline in multi-family loans of $690.4 million.
    Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan. Commercial loans are comprised of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, C&I loans and construction loans. Our primary focus over recent years has been on the origination of commercial loans.

Multi-family Loans. At December 31, 2020, $7.12 billion, or 34.1%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of multi-family loans. Our policy generally has been to originate multi-family loans in New York, New Jersey and surrounding states, which represent approximately 96% of total multi-family loans at December 31, 2020. The multi-family loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, which were originated at prevailing market rates. Multi-family loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years. 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2020, $4.95 billion, or 23.7%, of our total loan portfolio was commercial real estate loans. We originate commercial real estate loans which are generally secured by industrial properties, retail buildings, office buildings and other commercial properties. As of December 31, 2020, commercial real estate loans in 
New Jersey, New York and surrounding states represent approximately 93% of our commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans which were originated at prevailing market rates. Commercial real estate loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years. 
Commercial and Industrial Loans. At December 31, 2020, $3.58 billion, or 17.1%, of our total loan portfolio were classified as C&I loans. We offer a wide range of credit facilities to C&I clients throughout our geographic footprint and nationally. Our credit offerings are lines of credit, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate term loans, lease financing and letters of credit. A significant portion of our C&I loans are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. Other collateral for these types of loans can be comprised of real estate, equipment and/or a lien on the general assets, including inventory and receivables of the underlying business, and in many cases are further supported by a personal guarantee of the owner. Our product offerings include certain C&I lending subspecialties that originate loans both locally and nationally, including leveraged lending, healthcare lending and equipment finance. Our equipment finance portfolio totaled $839.3 million, or 23.5% of our C&I portfolio at December 31, 2020 and has grown substantially from the $345.8 million portfolio acquired in February 2018. Our equipment finance portfolio, comprised of both loans and leases throughout the U.S., is primarily secured by critical use assets. At December 31, 2020, approximately 32% of our C&I loans were to borrowers outside of New Jersey and New York. 
Construction Loans.  At December 31, 2020, we held $404.4 million in construction loans representing 2.0% of our total loan portfolio. We offer loans directly to owners and developers on income-producing properties and residential for-sale housing units. Generally, construction loans are structured to have a three-year term and are made in amounts of up to 70% of the appraised value of the completed property, or a maximum up to the cost of the improvements. Funds are disbursed based on inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. Construction financing for units to be sold require a pre-sale contract or we will limit the amount of speculative building without a sales contract.
Residential Mortgage Loans.  At December 31, 2020, $4.12 billion, or 19.7%, of our loan portfolio consisted of residential mortgage loans. We originate residential mortgage loans for our loan portfolio and for sale to third parties. During 2020, we sold more of our residential mortgage loans originated into the secondary market. While we have also purchased mortgage loans from correspondent entities including other banks and mortgage brokers, we did not purchase such loans in 2020. Our agreements call for these correspondent entities to originate loans that adhere to our underwriting standards and we generally acquire the loans with servicing rights. 
We offer various loan programs to provide financing for low-and moderate-income home buyers, some of which include down payment assistance for home purchases. Through these programs, qualified individuals receive a reduced rate of interest on most of our loan programs and have their application fee refunded at closing, as well as other incentives if certain conditions are met.
Consumer and Other Loans. At December 31, 2020, consumer loans totaled $702.8 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio. We offer consumer loans, most of which consist of cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2020, cash surrender value loans totaled $411.7 million, or 59% of consumer and other loans. Acceptable credit history and FICO scores are reviewed along with the evaluation of the financial rating of the insurance carrier. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by residences primarily located in New Jersey and New York. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest, with terms generally up to 20 years and to a maximum of $750,000. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest, indexed to the prime rate. 
Loan Originations and Purchases. The following table shows our loan originations, loan purchases and repayment activities with respect to our portfolio of loans receivable for the periods indicated. Origination, sale and repayment activities with respect to our loans-held-for-sale are excluded from the table.

Credit Policy and Procedures
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The credit approval process provides for prompt and thorough underwriting and approval or decline of loan requests. The approval method used is a hierarchy of individual credit authorities for new credit requests and renewals according to the Bank’s credit policies. All commercial credit actions require a total of two signatures, one from the Bank’s business line and one from the Bank’s credit risk management group. Transactions exceeding certain thresholds are submitted to the Bank’s Credit Approval Committee for decision. Consumer and small business transactions are underwritten according to guidelines and policy approved by the Credit Risk Committee. Any exceptions are approved by a credit risk officer. Our credit authority standards and limits are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). Approval limits are established on criteria such as the risk associated with each credit action, amount, and aggregate credit exposure of a borrower. While the Bank’s Board has delegated credit authority and the responsibility to approve authorities for lending and credit personnel to the Chief Credit Officer, the Board regularly monitors credit authority. Credit authorities are based on position, capability, and experience of the individuals. 
Loans to One Borrower. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the Bank’s capital funds. As of December 31, 2020, our regulatory lending limit was $397.0 million. We may lend an additional 10% of the Bank’s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank’s internal policy limit is $150.0 million, with exceptions to this policy communicated to the Board. The Bank reviews these group exposures on a regular basis. The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type. At December 31, 2020, there was one relationship that exceeded the internal limit totaling $178.1 million. The relationship was communicated to the Board and was performing in accordance with its contractual terms as of December 31, 2020. 
Asset Quality. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. We maintain sound credit standards for new loan originations and purchases. We do not originate or purchase sub-prime loans, negative amortization loans or option ARM loans. Our portfolio contains interest-only and no income verification residential mortgage loans. We have not originated residential mortgage loans without verifying income in recent years. At December 31, 2020, these loans totaled $109.0 million. At December 31, 2020, interest-only residential and consumer loans totaled $32.1 million, which represented less than 1% of the residential and consumer portfolio. Although it is not a standard product offering for commercial real estate and multi-family loans, we originate interest-only in addition to amortizing loans in these segments. At December 31, 2020, interest-only loans in these segments totaled $1.25 billion. As part of our underwriting, these loans are evaluated as fully amortizing for risk classification purposes, with the interest-only period generally ranging from one to ten years. In addition, we evaluate our policy limits on a regular basis. We believe these criteria adequately control the potential risks of such loans and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks. Since April 2020, we have, at the request of commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulting from the pandemic, temporarily deferred the payment of principal and/or interest for an agreed-upon period of time. Although a significant portion of these loans are paying interest-only during the deferral period, they are not included in the amount of interest-only loans disclosed in this section.
Direct finance leases are stated as the sum of remaining minimum lease payments from lessees plus estimated residual values less unearned lease income. On an annual basis, the Company reviews the lease residuals and assets currently off-lease for potential impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.6 million as the fair value of certain equipment decreased at a rate greater than originally projected. An additional impairment charge of $2.2 million was recorded on the same equipment class during the year ended December 31, 2020 given the extended downturn in the market for these assets. 
The underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower’s continued ability to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to do so, is dependent on the value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. A borrower’s ability to pay is typically dependent on employment and other sources of income in the case of one-to four-family mortgage loans and consumer loans. In the case of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, repayment is dependent on the cash flow generated by the property; in the case of C&I loans, on the cash flows generated by the business, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets, may also impact a borrower’s ability to pay. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, may also be impacted by a variety of factors including general economic conditions, demographics, maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays, including delays resulting from local, state and federal laws. 
Loan Deferrals. While we have continued to support our customers by granting payment deferrals for those experiencing continued hardship because of the pandemic, we have also worked diligently with our customers to ensure a return to current payment status for a significant portion of our clients who have ended their initial deferral period. At May 4, 2020, loans with an aggregated outstanding balance of $4.3 billion, or 20.1% of total loans, were in COVID-19 related deferment. Since then, customers representing over $3.5 billion have ended their COVID-19 related deferrals and as of February 14, 2021, loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately $756 million, or 3.6% of total loans, were in COVID-19 related deferment. 
The following table presents the balance of deferred loans in the Company’s loan portfolio by loan segment, industry sector and type of deferral as of February 14, 2021 which have not significantly changed since December 31, 2020.

Given the unprecedented uncertainty and continually evolving economic effects and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain. Should current economic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, we expect that this macroeconomic environment will have a continued adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including additional borrower deferral requests, delinquent loans and non-accrual loans. For more information on how the risks related to COVID-19 may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. 
Purchased Financial Assets with Credit Deterioration - Loans.  Loans purchased with credit deterioration (“PCD loans”) are loans acquired that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. PCD loans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 326-20 and are initially recorded at fair value with an allowance recognized on acquisition through a gross-up that increases the amortized cost basis of the asset with no effect on net income. As of December 31, 2020, PCD loans totaled $238.0 million. The Company acquired PCD loans with a par value of $251.5 million and an allowance for credit losses of $4.2 million in its acquisition of Gold Coast on April 3, 2020. See Note 3, Business Combinations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
As of December 31, 2019, purchased credit-impaired loans (“PCI”) totaled $4.1 million. PCI loans had been initially recorded under ASC 310-30 at fair value with no valuation allowance.

Non-Performing Assets. Non-performing assets include loans delinquent 90 days or more, non-accrual loans, performing troubled debt restructurings, real estate owned and other repossessed assets. Loans are classified as non-accrual when they are delinquent 90 days or more or if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We did not have any loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Non-accrual loans increased by $11.8 million to $107.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $95.3 million at December 31, 2019. Included in the amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020 were $4.8 million of C&I loans, $3.7 million of commercial real estate loans and $1.5 million of multi-family loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. Included in the amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2019 were $4.1 million of commercial real estate loans, $3.8 million of commercial and industrial loans and $1.3 million of multi-family loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold a non-performing multi-family loan with a net book balance of $18.1 million. The Company recognized a recovery of $1.9 million in the allowance for credit losses on the sale. During 2019, the Company sold $173,000 of non-performing commercial real estate loans, resulting in $29,000 of additional charge-offs.
The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans increased to 0.51% at December 31, 2020 from 0.44% at December 31, 2019. Our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets increased to 0.47% at December 31, 2020 from 0.46% at December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total non-accrual loans increased to 264.17% at December 31, 2020 from 239.66% at December 31, 2019. For further discussion of our non-performing assets and non-performing loans and the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.

At December 31, 2020, there were $34.5 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructured loans, of which $9.2 million were classified as accruing and $25.3 million were classified as non-accrual. Short-term loan modifications made in good faith to help ease the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not categorized as TDRs in accordance with the CARES Act. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $6.1 million. We recognized interest income of $1.4 million on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate and other assets we acquire as a result of foreclosure, by deed in lieu of foreclosure or repossession are classified as other real estate owned and other repossessed assets until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure or repossession less estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At December 31, 2020, we had other real estate owned of $2.2 million, consisting of 7 residential properties and other repossessed assets of $4.9 million, consisting of 99 pieces of industrial equipment.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified as “doubtful” has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. An asset classified as “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the institution’s books as an asset, without the establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. We classify an asset as “special mention” if the asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. See Note 5, Loans Receivable, Net, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
We are required to establish an allowance for credit losses on loans in an amount that management considers prudent for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. Expected losses are evaluated and calculated on a collective basis for those loans which share similar risk characteristics. Loans which do not share risk characteristics with other loans are evaluated for an allowance on an individual basis. When we classify problem assets as “loss,” we are required either 
to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the NJDOBI and the FDIC, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances.
We review the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
Collateral Dependent Loans. A collateral dependent loan is a loan for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. A loan is individually evaluated when it is a collateral dependent commercial loan with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million and on non-accrual status, a loan modified in a troubled debt restructuring, or is a commercial loan with $1.0 million in outstanding principal if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When the Company determines that the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics of other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for loans secured by real estate, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable, to ensure that the credit loss is not delayed until actual loss. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will charge off the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan. Smaller balance loans are evaluated collectively unless they are modified in a TDR. Such loans include residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and loans not meeting the Company’s criteria for individual evaluation. At December 31, 2020, loans meeting the requirements to be individually evaluated totaled $72.0 million. For further detail on individually evaluated loans, see Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using a modified retrospective approach. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.” Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the allowance for credit losses on loans was a contra-asset valuation account established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represented management’s best estimate of inherent losses that had been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans included allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, “Receivables” and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, “Contingencies.”
A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Allowance for Credit Losses.” 
Our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for credit losses on loans for the periods indicated.

Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses on loans allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for credit losses allocated to each category is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in any particular category as of the balance sheet date and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. For periods prior to 2020, the allowance for credit losses represented management’s best estimate of inherent losses that had been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans.

The allowance for credit losses on loans as of December 31, 2020 is maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in loans at the balance sheet date. However, this analysis process involves a high degree of judgment due to the subjectivity of assumptions used and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment. Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for credit losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if the future economic environment deteriorates from forecasted conditions.
As an integral part of their examination processes, the NJDOBI and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
Securities
The Board has adopted our Investment Policy. This policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest. The Investment Policy is reviewed annually by management and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to approval by the Board. The Board delegates operational responsibility for the implementation of the Investment Policy to the Asset Liability Committee, which is primarily comprised of senior officers. While general investment strategies are developed by the Asset Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our Treasurer. The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed and all securities are considered prudent for investment. Investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the Board at their regularly scheduled meetings.
Our Investment Policy requires that investment transactions conform to Federal and State investment regulations. Our investments purchased may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities issued by various Federal Agencies, State and Municipal subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial 
institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. In addition, the Company may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations.
The Investment Policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Purchase and sale decisions are based upon a thorough pre-transaction analysis of each instrument to determine if it conforms to our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider its effect on our risk-based capital measurement, prospects for yield and/or appreciation and other risk factors.
In December 2013, regulatory agencies adopted a rule on the treatment of certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities as covered funds under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), known as the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2020, none of our securities were deemed to be a covered fund under the Volcker Rule.
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial assets, including debt securities. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.” 
At December 31, 2020, our securities portfolio totaled $4.04 billion representing 15.5% of our total assets. At December 31, 2020, equity securities reported at fair value totaled $36.0 million. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased. At December 31, 2020, $1.25 billion of our debt securities were classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses and $2.76 billion were classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (“CMO”) securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (government-sponsored enterprises) and Ginnie Mae (government agency), and to a lesser extent, a variety of federal and state housing authorities (collectively referred to below as “agency-issued mortgage-backed securities”). At December 31, 2020, agency-issued mortgage-backed securities including CMOs, totaled $3.52 billion, or 87.1%, of our total securities portfolio. 
Actual cash flows on mortgage-backed securities may differ from estimated cash flows over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the yield on such securities. There is reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities. The fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and/or other market variables.
Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.23% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2020 was $3.55 billion, which is $107.1 million more than the carrying value. The unrealized gain is attributed primarily to a decline in interest rates during 2020. At December 31, 2020, we had no allowance for credit losses on mortgage-backed securities.
We also may invest in securities issued by non-agency or private mortgage originators, provided those securities are rated AAA by nationally recognized rating agencies and satisfactorily pass an internal credit review at the time of purchase. Currently, the Company does not hold any non-agency mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio.
Corporate and Other Debt Securities. Our corporate and other debt securities portfolio primarily consists of subordinated debt issued by other financial institutions. In addition, our corporate and other debt securities portfolio contains collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) backed by pooled trust preferred securities (“TruPS”), principally issued by banks and to a lesser extent insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. These securities have been classified in the held-to-maturity portfolio since their purchase. At December 31, 2020, corporate and other debt securities totaled $130.6 million, or 3.2%, of our total securities portfolio.
At December 31, 2020, the TruPS portfolio had a carrying value of $50.1 million, or 1.24% of our total securities portfolio, and a fair value of $67.3 million. TruPS with a carrying value of $15.9 million were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020. Throughout the year we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in valuing our TruPS portfolio. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, our TruPS and other held-to-maturity debt securities are evaluated for expected credit losses. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses on corporate and other debt securities was $3.2 million. Prior to January 1, 2020, an other-than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) analysis was performed. We did not recognize any OTTI charges for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds of $7.3 million from the payoff and paydown of TruPS which resulted in $3.2 million of interest income from securities, as well as a gain of $1.2 million recognized as non-interest income. We continue to closely monitor the performance of our CDO portfolio. 
Municipal Bonds.  At December 31, 2020, we had $246.6 million in municipal bonds which represents 6.1% of our total securities portfolio. These bonds are comprised of $51.9 million in short-term Bond Anticipation or Tax Anticipation notes and $194.7 million of longer term bonds. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses on municipal bonds was $34,000.
Government Sponsored Enterprises. At December 31, 2020, debt securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises held in our security portfolio totaled $113.5 million representing 2.8% of our total securities portfolio. At December 31, 2020, we had no allowance for credit losses on debt securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises.
Equity Securities. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of equity securities was $36.0 million, representing 0.9% of our total securities portfolio. The equity securities portfolio primarily consists of preferred stock carried at a fair value of $29.8 million at December 31, 2020. Equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and other factors. Such investments are carried at their fair value with fluctuations in the fair value of such investments reflected in the consolidated income statement.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits are the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities. Our strategy is to increase core deposit (savings, checking and money market accounts) growth to fund these activities. In addition, we use a significant amount of borrowings, primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”), to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds. Additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities, loan and securities prepayments and maturities, repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, income on other earning assets and retained earnings. While cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. At December 31, 2020, we held $19.53 billion in total deposits, representing 83.8% of our total liabilities. Our long-term deposit strategy has been focused on attracting core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts) as they represent a more stable source of low cost funds and may be less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2020, we held $16.81 billion in core deposits, representing 86.1% of total deposits, of which $886.5 million are brokered money market deposits. At December 31, 2020, $2.72 billion, or 13.9%, of our total deposit balances were certificates of deposit, which included $327.0 million of brokered certificates of deposit. Municipal deposits are a significant source of funds. At December 31, 2020, $5.50 billion, or 28.2%, of our total deposits consisted of public fund deposits from local government entities, predominately domiciled in the state of New Jersey. During 2020, deposits increased by $1.67 billion, or 9.3% partially as a result of the current economic environment including government stimulus and increased savings rates.
We have a suite of commercial deposit products, designed to appeal to small and mid-sized businesses and non-profit organizations. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are all reviewed on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on our current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements and competitive forces. We also rely on personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program to attract and retain deposits.
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to respond to changes in consumer demands and to be competitive in obtaining deposit funds. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates we pay on deposits will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 
We intend to continue to invest in technology platforms and branch staff training, de novo and acquired branches, and to aggressively market and advertise our core deposit products and will attempt to generate our deposits from a diverse client group within our primary market area. We remain focused on attracting and maintaining deposits from consumers, businesses and municipalities which operate in our marketplace. The Bank also utilizes Investors eAccess, a secure online channel, to attract deposits nationwide.

Enterprise Risk Management Framework
    Our Board oversees our risk management process, including the bank-wide approach to risk management, carried out by our management. Our Board approves the strategic plans and the policies that set standards for the nature and level of risk we are willing to assume. The Board receives reports on the management of critical risks and the effectiveness of risk management systems. While our full Board maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees, including Audit, Risk Oversight and Compensation and Benefits committees, oversee risk in certain specified areas. The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board meets quarterly and provides independent oversight of all risk functions. Our Board has assigned responsibility to our Chief Risk Officer for maintaining the Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks in the execution of our strategic goals and objectives and ensure we operate in a safe and sound manner in accordance with the Board approved policies. 
    The Bank’s Management Risk Committee meets regularly and provides governance over risk policy and risk escalation. The ERM framework supports a culture that promotes proactive risk management by all Bank employees, a risk appetite framework with defined risk tolerance limits, and risk governance with a three lines of defense model to manage and oversee risk. In a three lines of defense structure, each line of business and corporate function serves as the first line of defense and has responsibility for identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating risks in their areas. Independent Risk Management serves as the second line of defense and is responsible for providing guidance, oversight and appropriate challenge to the first line of defense. Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense and ensures that appropriate risk management controls, processes and systems are in place and functioning effectively. 
    Our ERM framework is consistent with common industry practices and regulatory guidance and is appropriate to our size, growth trajectory and the complexity of our business activities. The ERM Framework encompasses the following categories of risks; credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, operational risk, model risk, supplier risk, fraud risk, information security including cybersecurity, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,751 full-time employees and 123 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our Company respects, values and invites diversity in our employees, customers, suppliers, marketplace and community. We seek to recognize and develop the unique contributions which each individual brings to our Company, and we are fully committed to supporting a culture of diversity as a pillar to our values and our success. The Company provides multiple opportunities for professional development and growth and we are committed to promoting and improving retention, development and job satisfaction among our employees by providing skills training, peer mentoring and opportunities to interact and collaborate with senior leaders.
The Company reinforces its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion through ongoing efforts to reflect and adapt to the changing demographics of our communities. Our recruitment efforts at all levels of the Company are centered on our commitment to attract diverse, emerging and established talent. In 2019, the Company expanded its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through its “iBelong” initiative. This Company-wide strategic initiative continues to build on and strengthen our internal and external recruiting efforts, our internal policies, the education and development of our employees, and procurement and supplier diversity. During 2020, several programs were adopted and implemented as part of our iBelong 
initiative including the establishment of an employee-driven Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (the “DE&I Council”). The mission and objective of our DE&I Council has been and continues to be to create and execute on our plans to drive a diversity and inclusion strategy and develop the framework for implementing and impacting initiatives, programs, policies and processes. The DE&I Council will also work closely with our business leaders to identify and address specific needs of diverse populations within our Company and our markets. Within 2020, the DE&I Council developed, organized and implemented numerous training, education and awareness activities and campaigns throughout our Company.
We are committed to the good health and welfare of our employees, customers and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges to our Company and our employees to maintain employee and client health and well-being while continuing to be open for business for customers and our communities. Accordingly, we established a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak in our communities that included enhanced employee and customer communication and providing access to evolving safety standards and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state and local governmental agencies, as well as our workplace guidelines for customer and noncustomer environments. In addition, updated information is shared through regular emails and other digital communications with our employees and our customers facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional actions included adjusting our branch hours and lobby usage, for employee and customer safety, while remaining open for business to provide banking services. We continue to encourage employees to work remotely where possible during the pandemic. We also continue to monitor our communities and markets for areas where there is a resurgence or regression of COVID-19 and adjust our branch access accordingly. We also continue to follow and adhere to state and local restrictions related to COVID-19 to the extent applicable to help ensure the safety or our employees and customers. Our branches continue to be open for business and we continue to provide deposit, lending and other banking services, while our mobile and online banking networks are continuously available for digital banking transactions. 
Our Company’s employees actively give their time and talents to their communities through volunteer activities in financial education, economic development, health and human services, and community development. Within 2020, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees donated nearly 1,000 hours in support of more than 60 community organizations and charities. 
Supervision and Regulation
    The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the NJDOBI (the “Commissioner”) as the issuer of its charter, and, as a non-member state chartered commercial bank, by the FDIC as the deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. The Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC each conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and its depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
    As a bank holding company controlling the Bank, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA and to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the “New Jersey Banking Act”) and the regulations of the Commissioner under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies. 
    The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies. The Company is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commissioner and the FDIC. The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. The Company files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of NASDAQ.
    Our business is heavily regulated by both state and federal agencies. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its 
implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. In addition, on May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCP Act”) was enacted. This legislation includes targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial services laws. While there have been some changes to the post-financial crisis framework applicable to the Company, primarily relating to stress testing, the Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
Stress Tests
    Prior to the enactment of the EGRRCP Act, the Dodd-Frank Act required banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual stress tests. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC, in coordination with federal financial regulatory agencies, to issue regulations establishing methodologies for stress testing that provide for at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. The regulations also required banks to publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. The EGRRCP Act has eliminated the annual mandated stress test requirement for banks like us with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion.
    While we are no longer required to conduct annual stress tests, we have advised our regulators that we will continue to conduct stress testing of our loan portfolio and advise our Board and our regulators of the results of such testing.
Volcker Rule
    Under the provisions of the Volcker Rule we are prohibited from: (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for our own account; and (ii) having certain ownership interest in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The final Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. The Company has put in place the compliance programs required by the Volcker Rule and has also implemented a governance and control program to ensure appropriate oversight and ongoing compliance. In 2019, the U.S. banking agencies adopted changes to the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule designed to establish a more risk-based approach to compliance and reduce the complexity of the regulations. The changes were effective January 1, 2020. Regulatory changes to the Volcker Rule effective October 1, 2020, streamlined portions of the rule and loosened certain restrictions so that banks may engage in certain activities that the Volcker Rule was not intended to address but there was no impact to the Company.
Consumer Protection and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision
    The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over all banks, and its examination and enforcement authority applies to banks at or greater than $10 billion in total assets. The Bank is subject to CFPB supervision and examination of compliance with Federal Consumer Protection Laws. In addition, this agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws (“Federal Consumer Protection Laws”) that govern the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing. This includes laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
    The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and for state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. The Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulations and supervision by the CFPB as well as applicable state consumer protection laws and regulations, which will continue to increase our operating and compliance costs.
New Jersey Banking Regulation
    Activity Powers. The Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, commercial banks, including the Bank, generally may invest in:
•real estate mortgages;
•consumer and commercial loans;
•specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies;
•certain types of corporate equity securities; and
•certain other assets.
    A commercial bank may also make investments pursuant to a “leeway” power, which permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC. “Leeway” investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of “leeway” investments. A commercial bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Commissioner. Lastly, New Jersey commercial banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or 
out-of-state commercial banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and the related regulations. See “Federal Banking Regulation — Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks” below.
    Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank’s capital funds. A commercial bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank’s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
    Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a commercial bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the commercial bank. In addition, a commercial bank may not pay a dividend unless the commercial bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or if not, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. See “— Federal Banking Regulation — Prompt Corrective Action” below.
    Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed on insured state banks. See “— Federal Banking Regulation — Capital Requirements” below.
    Examination and Enforcement. The NJDOBI may examine the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The NJDOBI engages in routine annual examinations of the Bank. The Commissioner may order any commercial bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice, and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a commercial bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. The Commissioner may also seek the appointment of receiver or conservator for a New Jersey commercial bank under certain conditions.
Federal Banking Regulation
Capital Requirements.  Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank exercised its AOCI opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential real estate loans, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based 
capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.    
CECL Capital Implications. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit loss to be based on the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company’s relevant financial asset. For more information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.” On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that the Company adopted to delay for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e. a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, the Company will add back to common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”) 100% of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25% of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). After two years, starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of CET1 capital over the three-year period.
Paycheck Protection Program. On April 9, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interim final rule that excludes loans pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve’s PPP Lending Facility from supplemental leverage ratio exposure, average total consolidated assets and Advanced and Standardized risk-weighted assets. Additionally, PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, will receive a zero percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches regardless of whether they are pledged as collateral to the PPP Lending Facility. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, was enacted and included a reopening of the PPP.
Qualitative Capital Factors. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
    The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution’s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank’s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank’s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:
•the quality of the bank’s interest rate risk management process;
•the overall financial condition of the bank; and
•the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
    As of December 31, 2020, the Bank and the Company were considered “well capitalized” under applicable regulations and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as follows:

 | As of December 31, 2020 (1)
 | Actual | | Minimum Capital Requirement with Conservation Buffer | | To be Well Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions (2)
 | Amount | | Ratio | | Amount | | Ratio | | Amount | | Ratio

(2)Prompt corrective action provisions do not apply to the bank holding company.
    Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
    Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a “financial subsidiary” are subject to additional restrictions.
    Federal law permits a state-chartered commercial bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments or real estate development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank’s total assets or $50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary’s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary’s assets with the bank’s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State-chartered commercial banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that are not authorized under federal law. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities.
    Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a credit facility for member institutions. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, established by the respective Boards of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Banks. These policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the FHFA. The FHFA has also established standards of community or investment service that members must meet to maintain access to such long-term advances.
    Safety and Soundness Standards. Pursuant to the requirements of FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to matters such as internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
    In addition, the FDIC adopted regulations to require a commercial bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC. If, after being so notified, a commercial bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of FDICIA. If a commercial bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
    Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured commercial banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices.
    Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law establishes a prompt corrective action framework to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. Those regulations were amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective on the same date. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a 
common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
    Generally, a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a commercial bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Various restrictions, such as restrictions on capital distributions and growth, also apply to “undercapitalized” institutions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
    The Bank was classified as “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework as of December 31, 2020.
    Liquidity. The Bank maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation, in accordance with FDIC regulations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
    Deposit Insurance. The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC, up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
    The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance against all insured depository institutions. Each institution’s assessment is based on the perceived risk to the insurance fund of the institution, with institutions deemed riskiest paying higher assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments on average total assets less tangible capital, rather than deposits. The FDIC’s assessment schedule ranges from 1.5 basis points to 40 basis points of average total assets less tangible capital for institutions of the Bank’s asset size. The FDIC has a more comprehensive approach to evaluating, for assessment purposes, the risk presented by larger institutions such as the Bank. Large institutions (i.e., $10 billion or more in assets) such as the Bank are subject to assessment based upon a detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed.  The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, effective as of July 1, 2016, the FDIC implemented a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act that institutions with assets of $10 billion or more be responsible for increasing the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reached 1.36%, ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC regulations provide that surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more cease upon the DIF reserve ratio reaching the statutorily required minimum. Assessments on large banks for periods subsequent to September 30, 2018 no longer include a quarterly surcharge.
    Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We are not currently aware of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
    In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation was authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO began to mature in 2017 and fully matured in 2019. Consequently, insured banks are no longer paying a FICO assessment.
    Transactions with Affiliates of Investors Bank. Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B.
Section 23A:
•limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital and surplus, as defined in the applicable regulations. Such transactions with all affiliates are limited to an amount equal to 20% of such capital and surplus; and
•requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
    The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
    Pursuant to Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit (i) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (iii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board.
    Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to specific exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
    Privacy Standards. FDIC regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
    The Bank is also required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before it can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
    In addition, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank must provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having the Bank share their non-public personal information for marketing purposes with an affiliate or subsidiary before it can disclose such information.
    The FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies’ expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
    Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC-insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered commercial bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the CRA. Among other things, the current CRA regulations rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
•a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas;
•an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and/or census tracts and businesses; and
•a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
    An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. The Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in our most recent publicly-available federal evaluation, which was conducted by the FDIC in October 2017.
    In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
    In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the Federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. In December 2019, the FDIC, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency that regulates national banks, issued a proposed rule that would significantly amend the CRA regulations. In May 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final rule amending its CRA regulations. The FDIC, however, indicated it was not then prepared to issue a final rule. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA.
Loans to a Bank’s Insiders
    Federal Regulation. A bank’s loans to its insiders — executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (any owner of 10% or more of its stock) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such persons (an insider’s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to the Bank. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank’s capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.
    Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
    In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank’s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
    With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) $100,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank’s capital and surplus. 
    New Jersey Regulation. The New Jersey Banking Act imposes conditions and limitations on loans and extensions of credit to directors and executive officers of a commercial bank and to corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, which are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a commercial bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
Federal Reserve System
    Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank was required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. The requirements were adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board. Required reserves were maintained in the form of vault cash and/or an interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank; or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero, effectively eliminating the requirements, due to a change in its approach to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Board indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements but could in the future if conditions warrant.
Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification
    The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering (“AML”) requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act contains measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related FDIC regulations require the:
•Establishment of AML compliance programs that includes policies, procedures, and internal controls; the appointment of an AML compliance officer; an effective training program; and independent testing;
•Making of certain reports to FinCEN and law enforcement that are designated to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities;
•Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining and maintaining certain records from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;
•Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money-laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious activity;
•Monitoring account activity for suspicious transactions; and
•Impose a heightened level of review for certain high risk customers or accounts.
    The USA PATRIOT Act also includes prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and requires compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications.
    The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the BSA and AML programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities. The Bank has adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements. 
Holding Company Regulation
    Federal Regulation. Bank holding companies, including the Company, are subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Board regulations impose consolidated capital adequacy requirements on bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated regulatory capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The Company is therefore subject to such capital requirements.
    In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 
    A bank holding company is required to provide the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, would be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is as “well capitalized” under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, that has received a composite “1” or “2” rating, as well as a “satisfactory” rating for management, at its 
most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. Notwithstanding that regulation, Federal Reserve Board guidance provides that bank holding companies should notify the Federal Reserve Board of any proposed redemption or repurchase of outstanding stock that will result in a net reduction in total shares outstanding over the quarter. The guidance indicates that such notification is to allow the Federal Reserve Board to review the proposed redemption or repurchase from a supervisory perspective and possibly object to the redemption or repurchase.
    As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is also required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
    In addition, a bank holding company that does not elect to be a financial holding company under federal regulations is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are:
•making or servicing loans;
•performing certain data processing services;
•providing discount brokerage services; or acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor;
•leasing personal or real property; and
•making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare.
    A bank holding company that elects to be a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature. The Company has not elected to be a financial holding company, although it may seek to do so in the future. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if:
•each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well capitalized”;
•each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well managed”;
•each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination; and
•the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board stating that it elects to become a financial holding company.
    Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
    The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulates interstate banking activities by establishing a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching. As amended, this interstate banking and branching authority generally permits a bank in one state to establish a de novo branch at a location in another host state if state banks chartered in such host state would also be permitted to establish a branch at that location in the state. Under these amendments, the Bank is permitted to establish branch offices in other states in addition to its existing New Jersey and New York branch offices.
    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminated most of the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies previously imposed under federal banking laws if certain criteria are satisfied. Certain subsidiaries of well-capitalized and well-managed banks may be treated as “financial subsidiaries,” which are generally permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature, including securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking.
    New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms “company” and “bank holding company” as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey-chartered bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
    Acquisition of Investors Bancorp, Inc. Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control by the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner. 
    Federal Securities Laws. The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    The Company’s common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.
    As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.
Taxation
Federal Taxation 
    General. The Company and its subsidiary are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The Company and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company’s federal tax returns are not currently under audit. 
    The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or its subsidiary.
    Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. 
    Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, the Bank was subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable bad debt tax deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996 pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), which eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987. The Bank has fully recaptured its post-1987 reserve balance. Currently, the Bank uses the specific charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 
    Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 (pre-base year reserves) were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. As a result of the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987 are required to be recaptured into income over a six-year period. However, all pre-base year reserves are subject to recapture if the Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $45.2 million. 
    Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A corporation may carry forward net operating losses arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 indefinitely, subject to a deduction limitation of 80% of taxable income in a given year. However, net operating losses arising in tax years on or before December 31, 2017 are not subject to the 80% limitation deduction. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $4.5 million related to prior acquisitions, arising in tax years prior to December 31, 2017. 
    Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65% when the dividend is received from a corporation having at least 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. A 50% dividends-
received deduction is available for dividends received from a corporation having less than 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation.
CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes a number of changes to the current tax laws. The Company has evaluated the impact of the CARES Act and does not believe the CARES Act has a material financial impact on the income taxes of the Company.
State Taxation 
    New Jersey State Taxation. Generally, the income of corporations and savings institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and allocable to New Jersey is subject to New Jersey tax at a rate of 9.0%. On July 1, 2018, Assembly Bill 4202 (“A.4202”) was signed into law, providing significant revisions to New Jersey’s Corporation Business Tax laws. Among the changes provided for in the new legislation was a surtax, an additional imposition of tax, on corporate taxpayers that have allocated New Jersey net income in excess of $1 million. For tax years 2018 and 2019, the surtax rate imposed was 2.5%; and for tax years 2020 and 2021, the surtax rate was to be 1.5%. On September 29, 2020, Assembly Bill 4721 was signed into law, extending and retroactively increasing the surtax rate to 2.5% through December 31, 2023.
    In addition, A.4202 mandated combined reporting for tax years ending on or after July 31, 2019. In December 2019, a technical bulletin was issued by the State of New Jersey providing clarification on mandatory combined reporting, excluding investment companies and real estate investment trusts. The Company meets the definition of an investment company and one of its indirect subsidiaries meets the definition of a real estate investment trust, and therefore are excluded from combined filing with the Company’s other affiliates and required to file standalone returns.
    Prior to the issuance of the technical bulletin, the Company believed it would file a combined tax return for 2019 and therefore fully utilize its charitable contributions carried over from prior years as the recently reformed New Jersey tax law allows for charitable contributions of a member entity to be subtracted from the combined group’s entire net income. However, due to the clarification, the Company believed it would be excluded from the combined group, and therefore unable to fully deduct the charitable contributions. At December 31, 2019, the Company did not establish another valuation allowance and instead wrote off the state tax effect of the $9.7 million charitable contribution as it expired in 2019.
    New York State Taxation. The New York State corporate franchise tax is based on the federal consolidated taxable income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 6.5%. The amount of revenues that are sourced to New York State can be expected to fluctuate over time. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”) Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. The MTA surcharge for 2020 was 29.4% of a recomputed New York State franchise tax, calculated using a 6.5% tax rate on allocated and apportioned entire net income. The Company and its affiliates are currently under audit with respect to their New York State combined franchise tax return for tax years 2015 and 2016. 
    New York City Taxation. The Company and its affiliates are subject to the combined corporate tax for New York City calculated on a similar basis as the New York State franchise tax, subject to the New York City apportionment rules. The Company and its affiliates are currently under audit with respect to their New York City combined business corporation tax return for tax years 2016 through 2018.
    Pennsylvania Taxation. Considered a mutual thrift institution conducting business in Pennsylvania, the Bank is subject to the mutual thrift institutions tax. The mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5% on apportionable net taxable income and is required to be reported and filed on the annual Net Income Tax Report. Mutual thrift institutions are exempt from all other Pennsylvania corporate taxes.
    Delaware State Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
    Other State Taxation. To a lesser extent, the Company receives income from customers in other states. The Company’s filing obligations with respect to the receipts vary from state to state and depend upon the reporting requirements in the various jurisdictions.
