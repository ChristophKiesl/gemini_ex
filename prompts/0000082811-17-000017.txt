Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We sell our products directly to OEMs, distributors and end-users. We have multiple business units and each unit typically has its own branded product offering and sales organization. These sales organizations consist of varying combinations of our own internal direct sales people as well as exclusive and non-exclusive manufacturers' representative organizations. 
We operate large distribution facilities in Plainfield, Indiana; McAllen, Texas; LaVergne, Tennessee; and Florence, Kentucky, which serve as hubs for our North American distribution and logistics operations. Products are shipped from these facilities to our customers utilizing common carriers and our limited fleet of trucks and trailers. We also operate numerous warehouse and distribution facilities in our global markets to service the needs of our customers. In addition, we have many manufacturer representatives' warehouses located in specific geographic areas to serve local customers.
We derive a significant portion of revenue from our OEM customers. In our HVAC business, our reliance on sales to key OEM customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business, and we expect this customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future in this portion of our business. Despite this relative concentration, we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014.

7

same periods, total research and development and other engineering expenses, which include product and process improvements, were $77.3 million, $78.7 million and $85.0 million, respectively. 
Manufacturing and Operations 
We have developed and acquired global operations in locations such as China, Mexico, Europe, India and Thailand so that we can sell our products in these faster growing markets, follow our multinational customers, take advantage of global talent and complement our flexible, rapid response operations in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, including our own aluminum die casting and steel stamping operations, are an important element of our rapid response capabilities. In addition, we have an extensive internal logistics operation and a network of distribution facilities with the capability to modify stock products to quickly meet specific customer requirements in many instances. This gives us the ability to efficiently and promptly deliver a customer's unique product to the desired location.
We manufacture a majority of the products that we sell, but also strategically outsource components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers. We aggressively pursue global sourcing to reduce our overall costs. We generally maintain a dual sourcing capability in our existing domestic facilities to ensure a reliable supply source for our customers, although we do depend on a limited number of key suppliers for certain materials and components. We regularly invest in machinery and equipment to improve and maintain our facilities. Additionally, we have typically obtained significant amounts of quality capital equipment as part of our acquisitions, often increasing overall capacity and capability. Base materials for our products consist primarily of steel, copper and aluminum. Additionally, significant components of our product costs consist of bearings, electronics, permanent magnets and ferrous and non-ferrous castings.
We use our Regal Business System to drive Performance Excellence. Our Regal Business System provides us with a common language and a common set of business processes, disciplines and Lean Six Sigma tools. It consists of a set of standard reviews throughout the year to assess team progress in serving our customers, shareholders and employees. It is a significant part of our culture and fuels our continuous performance improvements. We believe our people are at the core of everything we do, and their deployment of these tools lead to operational excellence. We have invested in training hundreds of high energy teams, which have generated significant benefits and driven improvements in safety, speed, quality and cost.
Facilities 
We have manufacturing, sales and service facilities in the United States, Mexico, China, Europe, India and Australia, as well as a number of other locations throughout the world. Our Commercial and Industrial Systems segment currently includes 95 manufacturing, service, office and distribution facilities of which 37 are principal manufacturing facilities. The Commercial and Industrial Systems segment's present operating facilities contain a total of approximately 7.5 million square feet of space, of which approximately 33% are leased. Our Climate Solutions segment includes 42 manufacturing, service, office and distribution facilities, of which 18 are principal manufacturing facilities. The Climate Solutions segment's present operating facilities contain a total of approximately 3.3 million square feet of space, of which approximately 48% are leased. Our Power Transmission Solutions segment currently includes 31 manufacturing, service, office and distribution facilities of which 17 are principal manufacturing facilities. The Power Transmission Solutions segment's present operating facilities contain a total of approximately 3.2 million square feet of space, of which approximately 13% are leased. Our principal executive offices are located in Beloit, Wisconsin in an approximately 50,000 square foot owned office building. We believe our equipment and facilities are well maintained and adequate for our present needs.
Backlog 
Our business units have historically shipped the majority of their products in the month the order is received. As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was $355.8 million, as compared to $372.7 million on January 2, 2016. We believe that virtually all of our backlog will be shipped in 2017.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own a number of United States patents and foreign patents relating to our businesses. While we believe that our patents provide certain competitive advantages, we do not consider any one patent or group of patents essential to our business as a whole. We also use various registered and unregistered trademarks, and we believe these trademarks are significant in the marketing of most of our products. However, we believe the successful manufacture and sale of our products generally depends more upon our technological, manufacturing and marketing skills.
