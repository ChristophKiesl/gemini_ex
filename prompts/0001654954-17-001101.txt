 Background and Overview
  RumbleON, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an early stage company with a business plan to create a unique, capital light, and disruptive e-commerce platform facilitating the ability of both consumers and dealers to Buy-Sell-Trade-Finance pre-owned recreation vehicles. It is our goal to have the platform recognized as the most trusted and effective solution for the sale, acquisition, and distribution of recreation vehicles and provide users an efficient, fast, transparent, and engaging experience. Our initial focus is the market for 650cc and larger on road motorcycles, particularly those concentrated in the Harley Davidson brand; we will look to extend to other brands and additional vehicle types and products as the platform matures. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to RumbleON, Inc. as "RumbleON," "RMBL," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our," and similar words.
  Serving both consumers and dealers, RumbleON will make such consumers or dealers a cash offer for the purchase of their vehicle or will provide them the flexibility to trade, list, consign, or auction their vehicle through the website and mobile app of RumbleON and our partner dealers. In addition, RumbleON will offer a large inventory of vehicles for sale on its website and will offer financing and associated products. RumbleON operations are designed to be highly scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model created by forging a synergistic relationship with dealers. RumbleON will utilize partner dealers in the acquisition of motorcycles as well as to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, RumbleON will earn fees and transaction income, and partner dealers will earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales, leads, and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs.
  RumbleON will be driven by a proprietary technology platform, designed by an experienced development team. RumbleON acquired this platform on February 8, 2017 through its acquisition of NextGen (the "NextGen Acquisition"), as more fully described below, and anticipates the platform will be fully implemented by the RumbleON team in partnership with the developer over the next 60 days. The system provides integrated accounting, appraisal, inventory management, CRM, lead and call center management, equity mining, and other key services necessary to drive the online marketplace. Over the past 16 years, the developers of the software have designed and built, for large multi-national clients, a number of successful dealer and high quality online software applications solutions including applications for vehicle appraisal and inventory management, credit reporting and compliance, CRM and lead management, and a vehicle purchase platform. The product suite currently has modules supporting the motorcycle, RV, and marine and auto segments and is easily expandable for additional products in the future.

  Corporate History
  RumbleON, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada in October 2013 as a development stage company under the name Smart Server, Inc. ("Smart Server"). Smart Server was formed to engage in the business of designing and developing computer application software for smart phones and tablet computers to provide customers at participating restaurants, bars, and clubs the ability to pay their bill with their smartphone without having to ask for the check. Smart Server ceased its software development activities in 2015 and, having no operations and no or nominal assets, met the definition of a "shell company" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder. Smart Server continued as a public shell company through the year ended December 31, 2016, however Smart Server engaged in no business or operations during 2016.
  In July 2016, Berrard Holdings Limited Partnership ("Berrard Holdings") acquired 5,475,000 shares of common stock of Smart Server from the prior owner of such shares pursuant to an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, dated July 13, 2016. The shares acquired by Berrard Holdings represented 99.5% of the Smart Server’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Steven Berrard, a director and our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, has voting and dispositive control over Berrard Holdings. The aggregate purchase price of the shares was $148,141. In addition, at the closing, Berrard Holdings loaned Smart Server, and Smart Server executed a promissory note, in the principal amount of $191,858 payable to Berrard Holdings. Effective August 31, 2017, the note was amended to increase the principal amount by $5,500 to $197,358 in aggregate amount payable to Berrard Holdings.
   

 
  
 In October 2016, Berrard Holdings sold an aggregate of 3,312,500 shares of Smart Server common stock to Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other purchasers pursuant to letter agreements (each, a "Purchase Agreement"), dated October 24, 2016. The 2,412,500 shares acquired by Mr. Chesrown represented 43.9% of Smart Server’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The remaining shares owned by Berrard Holdings after giving effect to the transaction represented 39.3% of Smart Server’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The aggregate purchase price for the shares sold in this transaction was $139,125.
  On November 28, 2016, RumbleON completed a private placement (the "Private Placement") with certain accredited investors (the "Purchasers"), with respect to the sale of an aggregate of 900,000 shares of Smart Server common stock at a purchase price of $1.50 per share for total consideration of $1,350,000. In connection with the Private Placement, Smart Server also entered into loan agreements with the Purchasers pursuant to which the Purchasers will loan the Company their pro rata share of up to $1,350,000 in the aggregate upon the request of the Company at any time on or after January 31, 2017 and before November 1, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the convertible promissory note attached to each of the Loan Agreements.
  On January 8, 2017, Smart Server entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "NextGen Agreement") with NextGen Dealer Solutions, LLC ("NextGen"), Halcyon Consulting, LLC ("Halcyon"), and members of Halcyon signatory thereto ("Halcyon Members," and together with Halcyon, the "Halcyon Parties") pursuant to which NextGen agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets of NextGen in exchange for a payment of approximately $750,000 in cash, the issuance to NextGen of 1,523,809 unregistered shares of Company common stock (the "Purchaser Shares"), the issuance of a subordinated secured promissory note issued by the Company in favor of NextGen in the amount of $1,333,333 (the "Acquisition Note") and the assumption by the Company of certain specified post-closing liabilities of NextGen under the contracts being assigned to the Company as part of the transaction. On February 8, 2017, the Company assigned to NextGen Pro, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("NextGen Pro"), the right to acquire NextGen's assets and liabilities (but not any other rights or obligations under the NextGen Agreement). NextGen and the Halcyon Parties are collectively referred to as the "Seller Parties."
  On January 9, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and stockholders holding 6,375,000 of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Amendment") to change the name Smart Server, Inc. to RumbleON, Inc. and to create an additional class of Company common stock. The Certificate of Amendment became effective on February 13, 2017 (the "Effective Date"), after the notice and accompanying Information Statement describing the amendment was furnished to non-consenting stockholders of the Company in accordance with Nevada and Federal securities law.
  Immediately before approving the Certificate of Amendment, the Company had authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (the "Authorized Common Stock"), including 6,400,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the "Outstanding Common Stock," and together with the Authorized Common Stock, the "Common Stock"). Pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, the Company designated 1,000,000 shares of Authorized Common Stock as Class A Common Stock (the "Class A Common Stock"), which Class A Common Stock ranks pari passu with all of the rights and privileges of the Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common Stock will be entitled to 10 votes per share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and (ii) all other shares of Common Stock, including all shares of Outstanding Common Stock shall be deemed Class B Common Stock (the "Class B Common Stock"), which Class B Common Stock will be identical to the Class A Common Stock in all respects, except that holders of Class B Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding.
  Also on January 9, 2017, the Company's Board and stockholders holding 6,375,000 of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock approved the issuance to (i) Mr. Chesrown of 875,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Chesrown, and (ii) Mr. Berrard of 125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Berrard.
  Also, on February 8, 2017 (the "Closing Date"), RumbleON and NextGen Pro completed the NextGen Acquisition in exchange for approximately $750,000 in cash, the Purchaser Shares, the Acquisition Note, and the other consideration described above. The Acquisition Note matures on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Maturity Date"). Interest accrues and will be paid semi-annually (i) at a rate of 6.5% annually from the Closing Date through the second anniversary of such date and (ii) at a rate of 8.5% annually from the second anniversary of the Closing Date through the Maturity Date. The Company's obligations under the Acquisition Note are secured by substantially all the assets of the NextGen Pro pursuant to an Unconditional Guaranty Agreement (the "Guaranty Agreement"), by and among NextGen and NextGen Pro, and a related Security Agreement between the parties, each dated as of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Guaranty Agreement, NextGen Pro has agreed to guarantee the performance of all of the Company's obligations under the Acquisition Note. The descriptions of the Guaranty Agreement and Security Agreement are qualified by reference to copies of these agreements, which are attached as Exhibit 10.12 and 10.13 to this Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference

  Our Strategy
  RumbleON's strategy is to provide a complete online, direct, pre-owned recreational vehicle marketplace solution for both consumers and dealers, while providing dealers access to additional software solutions and services allowing them to earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales leads, and fees earned from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. The recognition of the need for RMBL solutions is the result of our management team gaining a clear understanding of the key drivers of complete supply chain solutions to create a different and disruptive way to both acquire and distribute cars and trucks online from their deep experience in the automotive sector with disruptive businesses such as: AutoNation, Auto America, and Vroom. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to disrupt the pre-owned marketplace in recreational vehicles as it suffers from many of the same negative consumer sentiments and dealer practices that existed in the automotive sector prior to the advent of and the significant influx of new entrants with improved business models. In addition, the recreation vehicle segment lacks the significant competition that exists in the automotive sector due to its fragmented dealer network, relative size and the niche nature of its products. Management believes consumers prefer to transact through a well-designed online/mobile solution, with a broad selection of vehicles at highly competitive prices. RumbleON applications will provide appraisal, cash-offer, vehicle listing or consignment, financing options, and logistics/delivery solutions designed to provide an exceptional consumer experience. We intend to replicate and improve upon the positive attributes of the various "Sell us your car" and other related programs that have proven successful in automotive retail for entities such as AutoNation, CarMax, Carvana, Vroom and others.
  RumbleON dealer strategy is focused on creating a synergistic relationship wherein dealers have the ability to leverage the RumbleON marketplace and dealer services offerings to drive increased revenue through the purchase or sale of vehicles via the online platform and the ability to earn fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. Dealer partners will have the ability to show the complete RumbleON vehicle inventory on their website and will have access to preferred pricing on the acquisition of vehicles. Management believes that partners utilizing the platform will significantly enhance their existing online retail strategies. RumbleON has agreed to add multiple dealers to its network and is in discussions with several other dealers regarding joining the network. RumbleON operations, designed to be both capital and infrastructure light, will leverage the dealer network to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution, thus alleviating the need for RumbleON to operate multiple warehouse locations, reconditioning centers and logistics facilities. RumbleON plans on operating a centralized headquarters, warehouse and call center model while decentralizing inspection and reconditioning activities.
  RumbleON's initial focus on pre-owned Harley Davidson motorcycles provides a targeted, identifiable segment to establish the functionality of the platform and the RumbleON brand. Harley is a highly regarded and dominant brand (approximately 50% market share of new 650 cc+ on road motorcycles according to both Harley-Davidson public filings and the Motorcycle Industry Council) in the motorcycle market with a base of over 3 million preowned motorcycles registered for use in the United States. Management estimates that each year approximately 400,000 preowned Harleys are sold with Harley dealers selling approximately 125,000 units, 250,000 units sold in private consumer and independent dealer transactions, and 25,000 via other means. As Harley-Davidson has discussed in its public filings, Harley’s efforts to grow ridership, including increasing its marketing spend by 65% ($75 million worldwide) in 2016 and driving brand awareness among all customers via dealer hosted experiences and the Harley Davidson Riding Academy, are designed to capitalize on the fact that the percentage of first time motorcycle buyers who purchase a Harley-Davidson has increased from 26% in 2011 to 33% in 2015. This not only is expected to provide a stable market of like equipment and a more informed buyer, but also allows RumbleON to potentially enjoy a halo effect from Harley’s advertising as not all young new buyers will purchase new motorcycles. RumbleON extension into the "metric" brands (Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, etc.) essentially doubles the available market and is a natural extension as these vehicles are often sold or traded for Harley vehicles. The metric market and dealer profile closely mirrors that of the Harley market although it is more highly fragmented. In addition, many of the metric dealers also retail ATVs, UTVs, snowmobiles and personal watercraft providing the next natural product extension after motorcycles leveraging existing dealer relationships.
  RumbleON initially intends to gain market share by targeting the significant number of private consumer transactions. We believe we can drive RumbleON brand recognition and awareness at a relatively low expense by utilizing aggressive digital, social media and guerrilla marketing techniques, as there are few national competitors and consumers are very brand focused and loyal. For example, approximately 15 key motorcycle events such as Daytona Bike Week and the Sturgis Bike Rally attract roughly 4.8 million attendees, many of whom are both motorcycle enthusiasts and Harley consumers. RumbleON intends on having a significant presence at several of these events, with onsite advertising and sales facilities to build brand awareness. In addition, we anticipate engaging with or sponsoring many of the active Harley Owner Group ("HOG") chapters, providing us a targeted audience to which to market RumbleON and showcase the ease with which they can buy, sell, or trade motorcycles. Once motorcycle enthusiasts have sampled the RumbleON website, we believe the unique experience will be compelling and drive organic growth. Over time, management believes RumbleON will be able to build a proprietary database of customers and their interests, which will facilitate customer retention and cross-sell activities.

 Our Market
  We operate in a market with significant scale and breadth of products. The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates that 9.2 million people own 10.1 million motorcycles in the United States; 87% of these are on highway models, our initial targeted segment. Used motorcycle registrations were 1.1 million units in 2015 with new unit sales of approximately 500,000 or approximately $7 billion in new vehicle sales. The owner demographic is favorable to the market outlook as millennials and baby boomers are maturing into the median ranges. The owner group is characterized by brand loyal riding enthusiasts. The median owner age is 47 years with a median income of $62,170 which is approximately 10% above the US average. The dealer market is fragmented with an estimated 5,000 new vehicle retail outlets in the motorcycle segment.
  The ATV, UTV, side-by-side, snowmobile and personal watercraft vehicle ("PWC") markets (collectively with motorcycles, “Powersports”) are a logical next extension for our platform, as there is significant overlap in the motorcycle dealer base with dealers of these products. According to Powersports Business’ 2016 Market Data Book, 2015 registrations for new and used side-by-sides were approximately 250,000 units and ATV unit sales represented an additional 228,000 units. Snowmobile sales were estimated at 57,000 units with PWC sales estimated at an additional 40,000 units.
  As we look to further extend the platform the two largest adjacent segments are represented by the recreational boating industry which generated sales of $26.7 billion in 2015 for boats and trailers and the recreational vehicle (motor vehicle or trailer equipped with living space and amenities found in a home) market which had estimated 2015 retail sales of approximately $16.5 billion.
  Competition
  We will face competition in all of our business segments. The U.S. used recreational vehicle marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and used vehicles; independent dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an outstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of vehicles, breadth and depth of product selection, and value pricing. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing will include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying experience by virtue of our low, no-haggle prices and our customer-friendly sales process; our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on our website. In addition, we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a vehicle from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles.  We believe the principal competitive factors for our ancillary products and services include an ability to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices delivered in an efficient manner to the customer. We will compete with a variety of entities in offering these products including banks, finance companies, insurance and warranty providers and extended vehicle service contract providers. We believe our competitive strengths in this category will include our ability to deliver products in an efficient manner to customers utilizing our technology and our ability to partner with key participants in each category to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices. Lastly, additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we will operate.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
  
 Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy.  Our principal trademark, RumbleON has an application pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Government Regulation
  Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.
 State Motor Vehicle Sales, Advertising and Brokering Laws
  The advertising and sale of new or used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states in which we do business. Although we do not anticipate selling new vehicles, state regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which recreational vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. If our products and services are determined to not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states. In addition, even absent such a determination, to the extent dealers are uncertain about the applicability of such laws and regulations to our business, we may lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of dealers in our network, which would affect our future growth.

 Several states have laws and regulations that strictly regulate or prohibit the brokering of motor recreational vehicles or the making of so-called "bird-dog" payments by dealers to third parties in connection with the sale of motor vehicles through persons other than licensed salespersons. If our products or services are determined to fall within the scope of such laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures, which could be costly, to reduce our exposure to those obligations, including the discontinuation of certain products or services in affected jurisdictions. Additionally, such a determination could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation.
  In addition to generally applicable consumer protection laws, many states in which we may do business either have or may implement laws and regulations that specifically regulate the advertising for sale of new or used recreational vehicles. These state advertising laws and regulations may not be uniform from state to state, sometimes imposing inconsistent requirements on the advertiser of a new or used recreational vehicle. If the content displayed on the websites we operate is determined or alleged to be inaccurate or misleading, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation. Moreover, such allegations, even if unfounded or decided in our favor, could be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant sums in settlements, and could interfere with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states.
   Federal Advertising Regulations
  The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.
 Federal Antitrust Laws
  The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be used by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our dealer network.
  In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.
   Other
  The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability.
Employees
  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had two full-time employees.
