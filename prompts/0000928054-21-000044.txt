Item 1. Business.
General
Flotek Industries, Inc. is a technology-driven chemistry and data company that serves customers in industrial, commercial and consumer markets. 
The Company’s Chemistry Technologies (“CT”) segment develops, manufactures, packages, distributes, delivers and markets specialty chemicals that enhance the profitability of hydrocarbon producers and cleans surfaces in both commercial and personal settings to help reduce the spread of bacteria, viruses and germs. 
The Company’s Data Analytics (“DA”) segment enables users to maximize the value of their processes by providing analytics associated with their hydrocarbon streams in seconds rather than minutes or days. The real-time access to information prevents waste, reduces reprocessing and allows users to pursue automation of their hydrocarbon streams to maximize their profitability.
The Company was initially incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia in 1985. In October 2001, the Company changed its corporate domicile to the State of Delaware. In December 2007, the Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the stock ticker symbol “FTK.” Annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are posted to the Company’s website, www.flotekind.com, as soon as practicable subsequent to electronically filing or furnishing to the SEC. Information contained in the Company’s website is not to be considered as part of any regulatory filing. 
As used herein, “Flotek,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refers to Flotek Industries, Inc. and/or the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. The use of these terms is not intended to connote any particular corporate status or relationship.
Recent Developments
During the second quarter of 2020, the Company acquired 100% ownership of JP3 Measurement, LLC (“JP3”), a privately-held data and analytics technology company, in a cash-and-stock transaction. JP3’s real-time data platforms combine the energy industry’s only field-deployable, inline optical analyzer with proprietary cloud visualization and analytics, which targets an increase of processing efficiencies and valuation of natural gas, crude oil and refined fuels. In conjunction with the acquisition of JP3, the Company created the DA segment.
The Company was impacted by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), a global pandemic that spread throughout the U.S. and the world during 2020. For a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19, see “COVID-19 Effects and Actions” in this Item 7 of this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the risks related to COVID-19, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Description of Operations and Segments
The Company’s continuing operations has two business segments, CT and DA, which are both supported by the Company’s continuing Research & Innovation (“R&I”) advanced laboratory capabilities. Financial information about the Company’s operating segments and geographic concentration is provided in Note 22, “Business Segment, Geographic and Major Customer Information” in Part II, Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.
Chemistry Technologies
The Company’s CT segment includes an energy-focused product line that is comprised of proprietary green chemistries, specialty chemistries, logistics and technology services. The Company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes, delivers and markets reservoir-centric fluid systems, including specialty and conventional chemistries, for use in oil and gas well drilling, cementing, completion, remediation and stimulation activities designed to maximize recovery in both new and mature fields, as well as to reduce health and environmental risk by using greener chemicals. Customers of this product line of 
the CT business segment include major integrated oil and gas companies, oilfield services companies, independent oil and gas companies, national and state-owned oil companies and international supply chain management companies. 
In 2020, the Company leveraged historical expertise, existing infrastructure, personnel, supply chain, research and resident consumer market experience to address the emerging demand for sanitizers, surface cleaners and disinfectants for both commercial and personal use. Rather than operating under relaxed pandemic-related guidelines, the Company sought to produce Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) compliant products by completing all necessary upgrades to its ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Marlow, Oklahoma. Today the Company has a portfolio of U.S. manufactured specialty chemical products to address the long-term challenges created by the current COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future outbreaks. To restore large public gatherings, it is believed that both vaccinations, behavioral changes, sanitizers, surface cleaners, and disinfectants are needed. The Company has made a commitment of being in this market for the long-term.
Data Analytics
Customers of the DA segment span across the entire oil and gas market, including upstream producers, midstream companies, refineries and distribution networks. The segment is continuing its transition to a revenue subscription model from selling its line of Verax analyzers, deployed in the field across the oil and gas sector, to support contracts and software services via its cloud-based Viper software platform. 
In 2020, the DA segment began preparing for international deployments, including export control classification, international certifications and product design modifications to meet the demands of overseas installations. Also in 2020, the Company hired a business development executive who is developing sales opportunities in the international market.
Research & Innovation 
R&I supports both segments through green chemistry formulation, specialty chemical formulations, FDA and EPA regulatory guidance, technical support, basin and reservoir studies, data analytics and new technology projects. The purpose of R&I is to supply the Company’s segments with enhanced products and services that generate current and future revenues, while advising Company management on opportunities concerning technology, environmental and industry trends. The R&I facilities support advances in chemistry performance, detection, optimization and manufacturing. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $7.2 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of research and development expense. In 2020, research and development expense were approximately 13.6% of consolidated revenue. The Company expects that its 2021 research and development investment will continue to support new product development, especially in support of enhanced environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) standards, increased adoption of green chemistry and conventional customization initiatives for its clients.
Discontinued Operations
Previously, the Company’s Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies (”CICT”) segment supplied high value compounds to companies that make food and beverages, cleaning products, cosmetics and other products sold in consumer and industrial markets. The Company classified the assets, liabilities and results of operations for this segment as discontinued operations at December 31, 2018. Effective February 2019, the Company sold the CICT segment.
Seasonality
Overall, operations are not significantly affected by seasonality; however, weather conditions can pose delays in clients’ activity levels. Certain working capital components build and recede throughout the year in conjunction with established purchasing and selling cycles that can impact operations and financial position. The performance of the Company’s services can be susceptible to both weather and naturally occurring phenomena, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the severity and duration of winter temperatures in North America, which impacts natural gas storage levels, drilling activity, commodity prices and operations at the Company’s facilities;
•material deviations from normal seasonality for an extended period can impact access to operations, reduced performance at manufacturing facilities, inability to deploy required personnel, supply chain interruptions, facility damage and customer activity levels;
•the timing and duration of the Canadian spring thaw and resulting restrictions that impact activity levels;
•the timing and impact of hurricanes upon coastal and offshore operations; and
•the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or similar phenomena, which may impact seasonal purchasing and selling cycles.
Product Demand and Marketing
Demand for the Company’s energy-focused products and services in both the CT and DA segments is driven by energy supply and demand, as well as operator desire to deploy improved ESG solutions. Demand for the Company’s energy chemistry products and services is dependent on levels of conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas well drilling and completion activity, both domestically and internationally. Demand for the Company’s U.S. manufactured sanitizing, surface cleaning and disinfecting products in the CT segment is driven by hygiene and cleaning trends and related purchasing behaviors among the commercial, governmental and consumer markets for sanitizing, surface cleaning and disinfecting products and services.
The Company’s products are marketed directly to customers through the Company’s own sales force and through certain contractual agency arrangements. In 2020, the Company participated in industry trade shows, some of which were virtual shows due to COVID-19 pandemic impacts. The Company also publishes technical papers and case studies examining the performance of its chemistries and methodologies for evaluating chemistries more effectively. While the Company’s primary marketing efforts remain focused in North America, a growing amount of resources and effort are focused on emerging international markets, especially in the Middle East. In addition to direct marketing and relationship development, the Company also markets products and services through the use of third-party agents, primarily in international markets. 
Backlog
Due to the Company’s contractual customer relationships and their transactional nature, the Company has historically not had significant backlog order activity.
Intellectual Property
The Company endeavors to protect its intellectual property, both within and outside of the U.S. The Company considers patent protection for all products and methods deemed to have commercial significance and that may qualify for patent protection. The decision to pursue patent protection is dependent upon several factors, including whether patent protection can be obtained, cost effectiveness, and alignment with operational and commercial interests. The Company believes its patent and trademark portfolio, combined with confidentiality agreements, FDA and EPA registrations and licensing, trade secrets, proprietary designs, and manufacturing and operational expertise, are sufficient to protect its intellectual property and provide continued strategic advantage. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 115 granted patents, consisting of 93 patents in our CT segment and 22 patents in our DA segment. In addition, the Company also had 44 pending patent applications filed in the U.S. and abroad, including 32 for the CT segment and 12 for the DA segment. The patents of the CT segment cover various chemical compositions and methods of use. The patents of the DA segment cover various systems and methods of use for online determination of chemical composition and data analysis. In addition, the Company had 60 registered trademarks in the U.S. and abroad, covering a variety of its goods and services.
Competition
The ability to compete is dependent upon the Company’s ability to differentiate its products and services, provide superior quality and service, and maintain a competitive cost structure with sufficient raw material supplies. Activity levels in the oilfield goods and services industry are impacted by current and expected oil and natural gas prices, oil and natural gas drilling activity, production levels, customer drilling and completion-designated capital spending, and customer commitment to improved ESG performance. The unpredictability of the energy industry and commodity price fluctuations creates both 
increased risk and opportunity for the products and services of both the Company and its competitors. The Company’s CT segment also competes with established companies and brands in the sanitizers, surface cleaners and disinfectants market. The DA segment faces competition from other providers of equipment and services for real-time information in the upstream, midstream, refining and distribution market.
Raw Materials
Materials and components used in the Company’s servicing and manufacturing operations, as well as those purchased for sale, are generally available on the open market from multiple sources. When able, the Company uses multiple suppliers, both domestically and internationally, to purchase raw materials on the open market. The prices paid for raw materials vary based on availability, weather, other commodity price fluctuations, contractual obligations, tariffs, duties on imported materials, foreign currency exchange rates, business cycle position and global demand. Higher prices for chemistries and certain raw materials could adversely impact future sales, contract fulfillment and product margins. The Company is diligent in its efforts to identify alternate suppliers in its contingency planning by reducing the number of contractually obligated volumes and utilizing competitive bidding practices to proactively reduce costs and potential supply shortages.
The DA segment currently sources spectrometers from a single supplier. Sufficient inventory exists to meet the expected 2021 needs without additional purchases. Supply chain disruption could adversely impact the results of the segment in the years 2022 and beyond.
Government Regulations
The Company is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including laws related to the environment, occupational safety, health, transportation and trade within the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business. These laws and regulations strictly govern the manufacture, storage, transportation, sale, use and disposal of chemistry products. The Company strives to ensure full compliance with all regulatory requirements.
The Company continually evaluates the environmental impact of its operations and attempts to identify potential liabilities and costs of any environmental remediation, litigation or associated claims. Several products of the CT segment are considered hazardous materials. In the event of a leak or spill in association with Company operations, the Company could be exposed to risk of material cost, net of insurance proceeds, if any, to remediate any contamination. No environmental claims are currently being litigated or investigated, and the Company does not expect that costs related to remediation requirements will have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
