ITEM 1. BUSINESS



In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to “Tuscan,” the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Tuscan Holdings Corp.



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 2018. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On February 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Microvast, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Microvast”) and TSCN Merger Sub Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of ours (“Merger Sub”). The terms of the Merger Agreement are discussed in more detail below. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, our activities were limited to organization activities, the completion of our initial public offering, and the evaluation of possible business combination candidates.



Formation and Initial Public Offering



In November 2018, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares (“founders’ shares”) of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“common stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, to our initial stockholders. In March 2019, we effectuated a stock dividend of 0.2 shares of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 6,900,000 founders’ shares.



In November 2018, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in our initial public offering (“IPO”), an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the stock dividend referred to above) (“representative shares”) at a price of $0.0001 per share.



On March 7, 2019, we consummated the IPO of 24,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000. We refer to the shares underlying the units sold in our IPO as our “Public Shares.”



Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 615,000 Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $6,150,000. The Private Units were sold to Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC, our Sponsor, and EarlyBirdCapital and its designees. The Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.



On March 12, 2019, we consummated the sale of an additional 3,600,000 units that were subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional units, we consummated the sale of an additional 72,000 Private Units at $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $720,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Units, an aggregate amount of $276,000,000 has been placed in the trust account established in connection with the IPO.



Proposed Business Combination



On February 1, 2021, Tuscan entered into the Merger Agreement with Microvast and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Microvast and Microvast will survive the merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tuscan. Under the Merger Agreement, all of the equity interests of Microvast will be converted into an aggregate of 210,000,000 shares of common stock (“closing shares”). The Microvast shareholders and the investors in Microvast’s majority-owned subsidiary, Microvast Power System (Houzhou) Co. Ltd. (“MPS”), will also have the ability to earn an additional 20,000,000 shares of common stock (“earnout shares”) if the daily volume weighted average price of the common stock is greater than or equal to $18.00 for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period (or a change of control occurs that results in the holders of common stock receiving a per share price equal to or in excess of $18.00), during the period commencing on the closing date and ending on the third anniversary of the closing date. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Tuscan and Microvast will jointly acquire 100% ownership of MPS and will discharge certain convertible loans of MPS.





1







Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides that Tuscan will issue an aggregate of 6,736,111 shares of common stock upon conversion (the “Bridge Notes Conversion”) of an aggregate of $57,500,000 outstanding promissory notes issued by Microvast.



Further, on February 1, 2021, Tuscan, the Sponsor, Microvast and certain stockholders of Tuscan entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the Sponsor and certain officers and directors of Tuscan (collectively, the “Sponsor Group”) agreed, among other things, to vote all equity interests of Tuscan held by such member of the Sponsor Group in favor of the approval and adoption of the proposed business combination with Microvast. Additionally, such members of the Sponsor Group have agreed not to (a) transfer any of their equity interests in the Company (or enter into any arrangement with respect thereto) other than as set forth therein or (b) exercise any conversion rights of any equity interests held by such member of the Sponsor Group in connection with the approval of the proposed business combination.



The Sponsor also agreed that, to the extent that certain expenses of Tuscan are in excess of $46,000,000 (unless such expenses shall have been approved by Microvast), the Sponsor will either (i) pay any such excess amount in cash or (ii) forfeit to Tuscan such number of shares of common stock held by the Sponsor that would have a value equal to such excess. The Sponsor also agreed to amend the escrow agreement to make certain adjustments to the terms of the escrow of its shares of common stock as set forth in the Sponsor Support Agreement.



Contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain investors entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”), pursuant to which such investors subscribed for an aggregate value of $482,500,000, representing 48,250,000 shares of Tuscan common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share in a private placement (the “PIPE Financing”) to be consummated immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions. Affiliates of InterPrivate Capital LLC (“InterPrivate”), a co-sponsor of Tuscan, subscribed to purchase 6.5 million shares in the PIPE Financing for an aggregate purchase price of $65 million.



Immediately following the Closing, the former equityholders of Microvast will hold approximately 69.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and the current stockholders of Tuscan will hold approximately 9.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which pro forma ownership (1) assumes no holder of the common stock sold in Tuscan’s initial public offering (such persons, the “Public Stockholders”) exercises its conversion rights in connection with the business combination, and (2) reflects the issuance of an aggregate of 48,250,000 shares of Common Stock in the PIPE Financing and 6,736,111 shares of common stock in the Bridge Notes Conversion, but does not include the effect of any other financing of Tuscan. If the maximum number of Public Shares are converted into cash such that Microvast does not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement (i.e., Tuscan has at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets immediately prior to or upon consummation of the business combination), such percentages will be approximately 76.8% and 0.2%, respectively.



Consummation of the proposed business combination is subject to customary conditions and covenants of the respective parties, including approval of Tuscan’s stockholders and Tuscan having available cash of at least $250,000,000. Further information regarding the proposed business combination, the proposed business of the combined company following consummation of the merger and the risks related to the proposed business of the combined company following consummation of the merger can be found in Tuscan’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 5, 2021, the preliminary proxy statement filed by Tuscan with the SEC on February 16, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement to be filed by Tuscan with the SEC. Unless otherwise indicated, the information in this Form 10-K assumes we will not consummate the proposed business combination with Microvast, and that we will secure a further extension to consummate an initial business combination and then seek to find an alternative target with which to consummate an initial business combination.

Extension Amendment



On December 3, 2020, Tuscan received stockholder approval to amend its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“charter”) to extend the date by which it must complete an initial business combination from December 7, 2020 to April 30, 2021. In connection with such extension, holders of 3,198 Public Shares exercised their right to convert their shares into cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.22 per share, for an aggregate conversion amount of approximately $32,684.



On March 12, 2021, Tuscan filed a preliminary proxy statement seeking approval from its stockholders to amend Tuscan’s charter to extend the date by which Tuscan is required to complete its initial business combination from April 30, 2021 to July 31, 2021 and to hold an annual meeting for the election of directors in accordance with Nasdaq listing rules.



Nasdaq Compliance



On January 6, 2021, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market stating that we failed to hold an Annual Meeting of stockholders within 12 months after our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), we submitted a plan to regain compliance on February 4, 2021. Nasdaq accepted our plan and granted us an extension through June 29, 2021 to hold an annual meeting. Nasdaq’s decision is subject to certain conditions, including that we provide periodic updates with respect to our proposed business combination with Microvast.
Effecting a Business Combination



Sources of Target Businesses



We have evaluated a number of target businesses, including Microvast. When evaluating each prospective target business, we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, and a review of financial and other information made available to us. We engaged EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. to provide services in connection with our initial business combination and, upon consummation of our initial business combination, we must pay that firm a fee in an amount equal to $9,660,000 (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable); provided that up to 30% of the fee may be allocated at the Company’s sole discretion to other FINRA members that assist the Company in identifying and consummating a business combination. We engaged Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) to provide financial advisory services in connection with the Microvast business combination, and, upon consummation of the transaction with Microvast, we must pay that firm a transaction fee of $5.5 million, plus expenses. Morgan Stanley also acted as placement agent in connection with the PIPE Financing, and we are obligated to pay Morgan Stanley a placement fee equal to (i) 3.5% of the sum of (x) the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the PIPE Financing up to $300 million (not including funds from the sale of certain excluded securities) and (y) any borrowings pursuant to a bridge financing provided in connection with the proposed business combination by investors introduced by Morgan Stanley, and (ii) 2.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the PIPE Financing above $300 million. In addition, Mr. Vogel and our Sponsor entered into an agreement with InterPrivate pursuant to which InterPrivate would advise us with respect to our evaluation of business combination transactions. Pursuant to the agreement, the Sponsor granted InterPrivate a profits interest attributable to a portion of the securities of Tuscan held by the Sponsor, subject to the consummation of our initial business combination. We may engage other firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, officers, directors, or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee, or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate our initial business combination, other than the monthly administrative services fee of $10,000, the repayment of working capital loans, and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, however, such repayment may be limited in connection with negotiations with a prospective target.



We are not restricted from entering into any such transactions with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors, and sponsor, and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. Microvast is not affiliated with any of our officers, directors, or sponsor.



Selection of Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------






3









● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | the target business’s compliance with U.S. federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective.



Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.





4







We have structured the proposed business combination with Microvast so that we will acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of Microvast. We are not limited to this structure, however, and may structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.



The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



Lack of Business Diversification



Although we do not currently intend to effect a business combination with more than one target business, we may do so, and there is no required minimum valuation standard for any single target at the time of such acquisition. Because we expect to complete only a single business combination, at least initially, the prospects for our success would be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we have scrutinized the management of Microvast, we cannot assure you that our assessment of Microvast’s management will prove to be correct. While we anticipate that Stephen Vogel will remain a director of ours following the business combination with Microvast, it is unlikely that he will devote his full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional personnel to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all.





6







Our Sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.



If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, Sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make purchases of our securities in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, Sponsor, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Conversion Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.



Our Sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior our IPO or purchased by them in the IPO or in the aftermarket. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the representative shares.



We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) physically tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.

The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our charter provides that we will have only until April 30, 2021 to complete an initial business combination (unless such time period is extended by our stockholders, as provided in our charter). On March 12, 2021, we filed a preliminary proxy statement to seek stockholder approval to extend our liquidation date from April 30, 2021 to July 31, 2021 and to hold an annual meeting for the election of directors in accordance with Nasdaq listing rules.



If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, or have not secured stockholder approval to extend such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Our Sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our charter that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by April 30, 2021 (or July 31, 2021, if the proposed extension is approved by our stockholders) unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, initial stockholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 21st month, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.



Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.



We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our IPO, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our Sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount in the trust account, inclusive of any interest (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founders’ shares and private shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our Sponsor has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.



Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our charter prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after April 30, 2021 (or July 31, 2021, if the proposed extension is approved by our stockholders), this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our IPO that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by April 30, 2021 (or July 31, 2021, if the proposed extension is approved by our stockholders), we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founders’ shares, private shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by April 30, 2021, and such date is not further extended, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in our IPO on an initial business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.




Facilities



We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 135 E. 57th St., 18th Floor, New York, NY 10022. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee Vogel Partners, LLP, an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, will charge us for general and administrative services. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees



We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. We do not have, and do not intend to have, any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
