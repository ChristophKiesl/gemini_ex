Item 1. Business
 
In this Annual Report, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Digital Development Partners, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Black Bird Potentials Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Black Bird”), Big Sky American Dist., LLC, a Montana limited liability company (“Big Sky American”), and Black Bird Hemp Manager, LLC, a Montana limited liability company.
 
Preliminary Statements Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, there exist significant uncertainties regarding the current novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, including the scope of health issues, the possible duration of the pandemic and the extent of local and worldwide social, political and economic disruption it may cause.
 
To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a discernable short-term negative impact on the ability of our company to obtain capital needed to accelerate the development of our business.
 
With respect to our business operations, while our product sales have increased since the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due primarily to our recently introducing hand sanitizer gel and spray products, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has had a discernable short-term negative impact on our product sales.
 
Overall, our company is not of a size that has required us to implement “company-wide” policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our product manufacturing operations have experienced no negative consequences attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, inasmuch as these operations involve a limited number of persons. However, as the states continue to re-open their economies, the scope and nature of the impacts of COVID-19 on our company will evolve day-by-day, week-by-week.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic can be expect to continue to result in regional and local quarantines, labor stoppages and shortages, changes in consumer purchasing patterns, mandatory or elective shut-downs of retail locations, disruptions to supply chains, including the inability of our suppliers to deliver materials on a timely basis, or at all, severe market volatility, liquidity disruptions and overall economic instability. It can be further expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have unpredictably adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware.
 
We intend to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only on our company, but on the operations of our customers, consumers and supply chains, and intend to make adjustments accordingly. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact continues to impact the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world, all of which remains highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
 
In light of these uncertainties, for purposes of the discussion below, except where otherwise indicated, the descriptions of our business and our strategies, including regarding us, our business and the market generally, do not reflect the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or our responses thereto.
 
Our Company After Acquiring Black Bird Potentials Inc.
 
With the January 2020 acquisition of Black Bird Potentials Inc., our company emerged from its long-standing status as a “shell company.” Our Board of Directors has adopted the business plan of Black Bird and our company’s ongoing operations now include those of Black Bird. The following sets forth information regarding our company that reflects these changes.
Corporate Name Change
 
In January 2020, holders of approximately 68% of our common stock, acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting, approved a change of our corporate name from Digital Development Partners, Inc. to “Black Bird Potentials Inc.” In January 2020, we filed the Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that is to effect this corporate action and submitted such filing to FINRA for approval thereof. FINRA did not approve such filing, due to an extended passage of time from our initial filing and our being late in filing certain of our periodic reports. In April 2021, our Board of Directors determined not to pursue this name change, in favor of a corporate name change to “Black Bird Biotech Corp.” Thereafter, holders of approximately 58.32% of our common stock, acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting, approved such corporate name change. Prior to the end of April 2021, we intend to file a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that is to effect this corporate action and submit such filing to FINRA for approval thereof.

History of Our Company
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2006 under the name “Cyprium Resources Inc.”, which was changed in August 2009 to “Digital Development Partners, Inc.” Through 2014, our company was involved, first, in the mining industry and, then, in the communications industry. From 2015 until the January 2020 acquisition of Black Bird, our company was a “shell company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In January 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a corporate name change to “Black Bird Potentials Inc.” and submitted such filing to FINRA for approval thereof. FINRA did not approve such filing, due to an extended passage of time from our initial filing and our being late in filing certain of our periodic reports. In April 2021, our Board of Directors determined not to pursue this name change, in favor of a corporate name change to “Black Bird Biotech Corp.” Thereafter, holders of approximately 58.32% of our common stock, acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting, approved such corporate name change. Prior to the end of April 2021, we intend to file a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that is to effect this corporate action and submit such filing to FINRA for approval thereof.
Business Overview
 
Black Bird is the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of MiteXstream, an EPA-registered plant-based biopesticide effective in the eradication of spider mites, a pest that destroys crops, especially cannabis, hops, coffee, and house plants, as well as molds and mildew. Also through Black Bird, we manufacture and sell CBD products, including CBD Oils, gummies and pet treats, and CBD-infused personal care products, as well as hand sanitizer gel and spray products, under the Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name. In addition, Black Bird is a licensed grower of industrial hemp under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program and has established “Black Bird American Hemp” as the brand name under which these efforts will be conducted.
 
Our corporate website is located at: www.digitaldevelopmentpartners.com. No information found on our company’s website is part of this Annual Report.
 
MiteXstream
 
Worldwide Exclusivity. Pursuant to a February 2021 Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution License Agreement (the “New MiteXstream Agreement”) with Touchstone Enviro Solutions, Inc. (“Touchstone”), a company owned by three of our directors, Fabian G. Deneault, L. A. Newlan, Jr. and Eric Newlan, Black Bird possesses the exclusive rights, even as to Touchstone, to manufacture, sell and distribute MiteXstream, an EPA-registered biopesticide (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). The exclusivity granted would be reduced to a status of non-exclusivity, should we fail to manufacture at least 2,500 gallons of concentrate in any year during the term of the New MiteXstream Agreement; provided, however, that such minimum required is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022. We are required to pay Touchstone a royalty of $10 per gallon of MiteXstream manufactured by us or by any sublicensee of ours. For no further consideration, we were granted the rights to use the “MiteXstream” trademark and the “Harnessing the Power of Water” trademark.
 
The New MiteXstream Agreement replaced a prior similar agreement with Touchstone (the “Original MiteXstream Agreement”) and served to expand Black Bird’s rights with respect to MiteXstream. The New MiteXstream Agreement contains the following important provisions as compared to the Original MiteXstream Agreement:
 

 | New MiteXstream Agreement | Original MiteXstream Agreement 
-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
Term | December 31, 2080 | Initial terms of 10 years, with one 10-year renewal term 
Territory | Worldwide Exclusive (1) | United States and Canada 
Royalty | $10.00 per gallon manufactured | Effective royalty of an estimated $50 per gallon 
Minimums | 2,500 gallons of concentrate manufactured per year (2) | $20,000 of product per year 
Sublicensing | Right to sublicense granted | No right to sublicense 
Trademarks | For no extra consideration, rights granted to use “MiteXstream” and “Harnessing the Power of Water” | For no extra consideration, rights granted to use “MiteXstream”


(1) | Exclusivity ends and becomes non-exclusive, if the minimum of 2,500 gallons per year is not met.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | The minimum (2,500 gallons per year) is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022.



The disinterested Directors of our Company approved the New MiteXstream Agreement.

Approval as Biopesticide. Effective December 16, 2020, MiteXstream was approved as a biopesticide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). We have begun to seek approval for use of MiteXstream in the various states; the state approval process takes between one and eight months, variously. To date, MiteXstream is approved for sale in Nevada. Until we obtain the required pesticide certification in a state, we will not sell any MiteXstream in that state. In addition, we intend to seek approval of MiteXstream in countries around the world, although no specific time for such actions has been set.
Sales and Distribution. We have begun to market MiteXstream through channels known to our management. However, it is our intention to secure a small number of established distributors through which to sell MiteXstream in the United States. There is no assurance we will be successful in these efforts.
 
In March 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with IFC Fulfillment Company (“IFC”), a Los Angeles-based export firm, whereby IFC was appointed the exclusive distributor for MiteXstream in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our Director, Jack Jie Qin, a Company director, facilitated the signing of the IFC Agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report, IFC has not made a sale of MiteXstream.
 
Background—The Spider Mite Problem. Our President, Fabian G. Deneault, was, from 2017 through 2019, a licensed dispenser of medical marijuana (MMJ) in the State of Montana and, as such, was permitted to grow marijuana plants for use in his MMJ dispensary business. As a licensed medical marijuana grower, Mr. Deneault encountered infestations of spider mites on his plants. To combat the spider mites, Mr. Deneault developed the MiteXstream formulation (see “Product Effectiveness” below).
 
Mr. Deneault soon came to understand that the spider mite issue is an industry-wide issue. In fact, in addition to marijuana, spider mites are a significant pest in the production of industrial hemp, coffee and hops, among other agricultural products.
 
Product Effectiveness. In testing done by our company, we have determined that, when mixed with water at the prescribed dilution rate, MiteXstream is effective in eliminating spider mites and their eggs, with no risk of plant damage.
 
Further, based on independent lab testing (see results under “Independent Lab Testing” below), users of MiteXstream are able to treat their cannabis (marijuana) plants through the day of harvest and still satisfy state-level pesticide testing standards.
 
Independent Lab Testing. In January 2019, Stillwater Labs, an Olney, Montana-based medical marijuana testing facility, concluded its testing of a cannabis sample treated only with MiteXstream. In addition to testing for pesticides prohibited by the State of Montana, Stillwater Labs also tested for pesticides prohibited by the State of Oregon, the most stringent state-level marijuana testing standard. The results of this testing, presented as being measured in parts per billion (PPB), are set forth below.

Competition. The pesticide industry is characterized by severe competition, evolving industry standards, evolving business and distribution models, price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, and price sensitivity on the part of customers. Many of our competitors possess substantially greater resources, financial and otherwise, than does our company. In addition, MiteXstream lacks name recognition. Our future success will depend on our ability to gain product name recognition and customer loyalty, as well as our being able to anticipate and respond to emerging standards and other unforeseen changes. If we fail to satisfy such standards of operation, our operating results could suffer. Further, intra-industry consolidations may result in stronger competitors and may, therefore, also harm our future results of operations. There is no assurance that we will ever overcome these challenges.
Regulation. Field testing, production and marketing of pesticide products are regulated by federal, state, local and foreign governments. The EPA regulates pesticides in the U.S. under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (“FIFRA”). Pesticides also are regulated by the states. MiteXstream is registered under FIFRA and, prior to sale in any state, will be approved by such state.
CBD Products – Grizzly Creek Naturals
 
CBD Products. We have created “Grizzly Creek Naturals” as the brand name for our CBD-related products, which are manufactured by our company using CBD purchased from third parties. Once we begin producing commercial quantities of industrial hemp and extracting the CBD therefrom, we will begin to use all of our own CBD and supplement it with CBD from third parties, as necessary.
 
We have expanded our line of Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products and currently manufacture and sell the following items:
 

· | CBD Oil: Original, Huckleberry and Cherry Flavors in 100mg, 250mg, 500mg, 1000mg and 2500mg dosages
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | CBD-Infused Body Butter (500mg): Unscented and Huckleberry Scent 
· | CBD-Infused Lip Balm (30mg): Huckleberry Scent 
· | Bath Bomb with 50mg of CBD: Eucalyptus, Lavender and Citrus Scents 



In July 2020, we began sales of CBD gummies on a private-label basis.
 

7

Other Products. In April 2020, we began sales of our Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer to distributors, directly to retail customers and directly to consumers through our website, having completed our initial FDA product listing in March 2020.
Hand Sanitizer. In April 2020, we began to manufacture and sell our Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer gel and spray products (without CBD) to distributors, directly to retail customers and directly to consumers through our website, having completed our initial FDA product listing in March 2020. As further discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section hereof, since their introduction, demand for our hand sanitizer products has exceeded our ability to produce these products. The primary hindrance to our ability to produce enough hand sanitizer products has been a scarcity of plastic bottles, pumps and caps available to us, which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this scarcity of plastic bottles, pumps and caps to abate during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, but no assurance can be made in this regard.
Products for Animals. In August 2020, we introduced CBD products for dogs under our Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name.
 
Distribution.
 
In-House Distribution. Since it began to manufacture and sell its CBD products in mid-2019, Black Bird has self-distributed its products. In December 2020, these distribution efforts we formalized with the formation of a new distribution subsidiary, Big Sky American Dist., LLC, a Montana limited liability company (“Big Sky American”). Big Sky American currently distributes the Grizzly Creek Naturals products to approximately 50 retail locations in Western Montana. In December 2020, Big Sky American entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Big Sky APA”), whereby it purchased certain distribution-related assets associated with approximately 200 retail locations in Western Montana for $200,000 in cash. These assets became available for purchase, due their owner’s determination to terminate its distribution business in such locations. The closing of under the Big Sky APA occurred in February 2021.
Website. We sell our products to consumers through our website: www.grizzlycreeknaturals.com.
 
Third-Party Distributors. Since the third quarter of 2019, Black Bird has entered into separate distribution agreements with four distributors. During the third quarter of 2019, Black Bird entered into a distribution agreement with CBD INC Limited Liability Partnership (the “Initial Nevada Distributor”). The Initial Nevada Distributor’s initial purchase of our products was approximately $8,900 which remains unpaid; no further purchases were made. Effective July 1, 2020, we terminated the agreement with the Initial Nevada Distributor, due to non-payment of sums due and to its failure to pursue the distribution of our products with reasonable commercial effort. In conjunction with our terminating the Initial Nevada Distributor, we entered into a letter agreement with Las Vegas-based Hope Botanicals LLC (the “Hope Distributor”), with respect to its selling our products primarily in the Las Vegas area. Hope Distributor has taken over the retail premises of the Initial Nevada Distributor and is actively pursuing sales of our products.
 
In March 2020, Black Bird entered into a Regional Development and Distribution Agreement with Northland Partners, LLC (the “Tri-State Distributor”), who will focus on distribution of our products in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. Tri-State Distributor has the right to distribute Black Bird’s products anywhere in the United States. Due to existing COVID-19-related restrictions during 2020, the Tri-State Distributor did not purchase any products from us. We are unable to estimate our total 2021 sales to Tri-State Distributor.
 
In May 2020, we began to distribute our hand sanitizer products through Raghorn Wholesale, LLC (“Raghorn”), a Montana-based distributor of consumer products to approximately 1,000 retail locations in Montana, North Dakota, Idaho and Washington. In July 2020, Black Bird and Raghorn entered into a written distribution agreement. Raghorn has become our largest customer. Through the date of this Annual Report, Raghorn has purchased approximately $30,000 of our hand sanitizer products. Raghorn does not distribute our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products. Raghorn is the party from which Big Sky American purchased the distribution assets under the Big Sky APA.
 
Each of our distributors has the right to distribute our products anywhere in the United States.
 
We continue to seek additional distributors who are able to demonstrate, to our management’s satisfaction, an ability to develop robust sales for our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products.

Perceived Benefits of CBD. The current growth in sales of CBD products is primarily due to perceived benefits expressed by those who have used CBD products. While our company does not make any claims as to the effectiveness or potential benefits of CBD, the following perceived benefits expressed by those who have used CBD products include, among others:
 

• Relief for Chronic Pain • Reduces Seizures • Reduces Anxiety and Depression • Reduces Inflammation | • Promotes Healthy Weight • Improves Heart Health • Improves Skin Conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Source: CBD Oil Benefits and Uses for Pain, Anxiety, Cancer and More, Dr. Josh Axe, DC, DMN, CNS; https://draxe.com/cbd-oil-benefits) | 

Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses. With respect to our Grizzly Creek Naturals products, we believe our company possesses the following competitive strengths and weaknesses:
 

Competitive Strengths: | • our products are produced using high-quality ingredients • we enjoy low overhead costs 
------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Competitive Weaknesses: | • none of our products enjoys brand name recognition • we possess limited capital • we have limited personnel

Competition.
 
CBD Products. The market for CBD products is growing rapidly and the competition for customers is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no significant barriers to entry. We expect competitive conditions to increase over time. There is no assurance that our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products will achieve profitability in the face of such competition.
Hand Sanitizer. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of hand sanitizer products skyrocketed and numerous companies became first-time participants in this market segment. Currently, there is intense competition for raw materials with which to manufacture and package hand sanitizer products, in response to COVID-19-related end-user, both consumer and business, demand.
 
To date, while we have been able to sell substantially all of the hand sanitizer products produced by us, our operations have been impeded by our inability to obtain larger supplies of needed plastic bottles, pumps and caps. There is no assurance that we will successfully overcome the intense competition for needed raw materials, in the near term. Further, there no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully for customers for our hand sanitizer products.
 
Regulation. 
 
CBD Products. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, CBD products may be sold legally, if and only if the hemp from which the CBD is derived is produced in a manner consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill, associated federal regulations, associated state regulations and by a licensed grower. Our CBD products are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill.
 
Hand Sanitizer. Because we manufacture hand sanitizer products, we are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In compliance with such regulatory requirements, Black Bird obtained a labeler code and we submit our products and associated labels for FDA approval for listing on the National Drug Code Directory. In addition, Black Bird follows current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) in the production of the Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer products.
 
Hemp-Related Activities
 
We have formed a division of our company that focuses on hemp-related business opportunities under the “Black Bird American Hemp” brand name. Black Bird American Hemp currently seeks to develop industrial hemp processing operations in the State of Montana. In this regard, while Black Bird is a licensed hemp grower in Montana under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program, it is not contemplated that Black Bird will, itself, become a significant grower of hemp.
 
Hemp Industry Background. Hemp, or “industrial hemp”, is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant species that is grown specifically for the industrial uses of its derived products. In fact, hemp has been found to be useful as a crop, providing many associated products for over 10,000 years, including biodegradable plastics, “hemp-crete,” insulation, paper, textiles, paint, biofuel, food and animal feed.

The road to development of industrial hemp in the United States has not been smooth. Famous early Americans, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, among others, were known to grow hemp and its use in making paper was widespread during colonial times. Throughout the 19th Century, industrial hemp served as a significant cash crop. In the 20th Century, industrial hemp became associated with the use of marijuana, due to the fact that both belong to the Cannabis Sativa species, and was effectively outlawed.
 
It was not until the passage of the Farm Bill of 2014, followed by the Farm Bill of 2018, that Congress finally disassociated industrial hemp and marijuana and removed both CBD and hemp from the Class I controlled substance category of the Controlled Substance Act. Industrial hemp contains, by definition, a maximum of 0.3% of the psychoactive substance, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
 
Like many states, Montana has adopted a Hemp Pilot Program (the “Montana Program”) for farmers in Montana, pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Farm Bill of 2018. The Montana Program requires hemp growers to obtain a yearly permit for growing industrial hemp, subject to compliance with the Rules and Regulations of the Department of Agriculture of Montana.
 
For 2020, approximately 40,000 acres of licensed hemp were cultivated in Montana and a total of approximately 465,000 acres of licensed hemp was cultivated in the United States, which acreage totals are expected to increase in each of the next several years. According to New Frontier Data, hemp-related revenues in the U.S. for 2020 will be approximately $5.9 billion.
 
The passage of the Farm Bill of 2018 removed hemp and all of its derivatives from the Controlled Substances Act, thereby reviving hemp production and processing as viable businesses in the United States for companies seeking to meet the now-growing demand for hemp products, hemp-derived CBD and hemp consumer packaged goods.
 
The Hemp Business Journal estimated that the U.S. hemp industry will grow to at least $1.9 billion by 2022, with an estimated 14.4% annual rate of growth. According to a 2019 report by Research and Markets, the global industrial hemp market size is anticipated to reach $10.6 billion by 2025.
 
Currently, the majority of hemp products sold in the U.S., such as hemp foods, healthcare products, textiles and building materials, are imported from other countries, especially China and many European countries. However, as domestic restrictions continue to ease, U.S. companies are acquiring, and are expected to continue to acquire, a greater percentage of the hemp product market, both in the U.S. and internationally. The Company believes that American grown and processed hemp products will continue to gain market share in future years.
 
We believe that there is a shortage of hemp processing capacity in the United States, in general, and in the State of Montana, in particular.
 
Hemp Processing. The processing of industrial hemp involves the mechanical stripping of the hemp stalk, which range in length from four to twelve or more feet, separating the tough woody interior, the “hurd,” from the softer fibrous exterior of the stalk, the “bast” material, which is the cellulosic fibers found in the phloem of the stalk. We are attempting to establish a hemp processing facility in Montana that will utilize only mechanical processing techniques without the application of chemicals.
Proposed Hemp Processing Facility. Should we obtain adequate funds, we intend to establish a small hemp processing facility in Montana capable of processing approximately 1,000 acres of hemp on an annual basis. There is no assurance that we will ever possess sufficient funds with which to establish the proposed hemp processing facility.
Design and Construction. We have retained the professional services of Ag Processing Solutions, Inc. (“AgPro”), a Great Falls, Montana, engineering firm. AgPro is to assist us in the selection of the location of the proposed hemp processing facility, the specifications for the equipment to be utilized therein and the purchase of the equipment. In addition, AgPro would monitor the construction of the infrastructure and installation of the equipment associated with the proposed hemp processing facility.
Location. We have not yet selected a location for the proposed hemp processing facility.
 
Source of Processing Material. Black Bird American Hemp would acquire hemp to process from farmers, directly. This will be accomplished by purchase of harvested crops, contracting for purchase of crops prior to the planting season or any time up to harvest. Black Bird American Hemp may contract with farmers for the farmers to plant and deliver harvested crops at an established price or at market. Black Bird American Hemp may contract with farmers to provide the farmer with seed for planting, participate in crop costs during the growing period and agree to pay a predetermined price for a crop at the time of harvest. Black Bird American Hemp may, in addition, offer hemp processing services for a fee based on a weight-of-product-processed basis and may include with such services short or intermediate-term hemp storage.

10

Montana Licensing Requirements. To commence operations at the proposed hemp processing facility, Black Bird American Hemp will be required to obtain a hemp processor license, a hemp grower license and a commodity dealer license from the State of Montana, in addition to certain licenses from the local jurisdiction in which the proposed hemp processing facility will be located.
Products. Should the proposed hemp processing facility commence operations, Black Bird American Hemp intends to sell, for its own account or for processing customers’ accounts, the products derived from the proposed hemp processing facility’s operations, including, without limitation, bast, hurd, hemp oil, hemp seeds and hemp hearts. The potential applications and, thus, target markets for Black Bird American Hemp’s products include the following, among many others:

• | Bast is the fiber collected from the phloem (the “inner bark” or “skin”) or bast surrounding the stem of the hemp plant. The bast fiber is used in many forms of textiles and in the manufacture of many industrial products, including bioplastics and insulation, both as batt insulation and blown-in insulation. Black Bird American Hemp intends to focus its sales efforts on potential industrial applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Hurd is the woody chips within the inner core of the hemp stock. Hurd is used to manufacture paper products and certain building materials, such as “hemp-crete” and fiber board, as an oil absorbent and for animal bedding. Black Bird American Hemp intends to focus its sales efforts on building materials and animal bedding. 
• | Hemp Flower is the source for hemp seeds and hemp oil, from which CBD is able to be extracted. Black Bird American Hemp intends to focus on sales of the hemp heart, the protein-dense “nut” within the hemp seed. 

Competition. Black Bird American Hemp will face competition from other hemp processors, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and stronger financial resources and experience than Black Bird American Hemp. If Black Bird American Hemp is not successful in competing effectively, our company could experience an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
In order to be competitive, Black Bird American Hemp will be required to implement effective marketing, sales and support strategies. Black Bird American Hemp may not be able to retain the services of sufficient expertise in marketing, sales and support efforts, to the detriment of our company’s overall business, financial condition, results of operations and market share. There is no assurance Black Bird American Hemp will successfully compete in its markets.
 
Sales and Distribution. Black Bird American Hemp will market hemp products directly to end-users of such products and will seek distributors who are able to demonstrate an ability to develop robust sales of Black Bird American Hemp’s products.
Governmental Regulations.
 
In General. The Farm Bill of 2018 removed hemp and all of its derivatives from the Controlled Substances Act. However, state or local governments can, and do, impose limitations.
In Montana. To commence operations at the proposed hemp processing facility, Black Bird American Hemp will be required to obtain a hemp processor license, a hemp grower license and a commodity dealer license from the State of Montana, in addition to certain licenses from the local jurisdiction in which the proposed hemp processing facility will be located.
Recent Development. Recently, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) published an Interim Final Rule (“IFR”) that could be disruptive to United States hemp processors. The IFR can be interpreted to declare that, for a short period of time in the processing cycle, there occurs a concentration of THC in excess of the 0.3% limitation, resulting in the whole product becoming a controlled substance, even though the process would result in no product with THC in excess of the 0.3 % limitation. A lawsuit has been instigated by the Hemp Industries Association, to block the effect of such IFR, as it appears to be an illegal extension of the authority of the DEA and contrary to the Farm Bill of 2018, the bill legalizing industrial hemp. If the IFR is upheld by the courts, it could have a damaging effect on Black Bird American Hemp’s ability to process hemp and carry on the intended business.
Environmental Laws. Black Bird American Hemp intends to operate the proposed hemp processing facility in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. If Black Bird American Hemp should fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, it is possible that a governmental enforcement action could result in the restricting or ceasing of its then-existing operations, if any. Any such situation could result in our company’s being required to take measures that would require capital expenditures, installation of new equipment or other corrective actions. In addition, our company could be required to pay for any losses or damage due to Black Bird American Hemp’s operations and/or be required to pay civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of any such laws or regulations.
