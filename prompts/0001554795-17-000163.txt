ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Historical Development 
 
On February 27, 1986 Bingham Canyon Corporation (“Bingham”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware as Hystar Aerospace Marketing Corporation of Delaware (“Hystar-Delaware”) and was a subsidiary of Nautilus Entertainment, Inc., (now called VIP Worldnet, Inc.), a Nevada corporation. Hystar-Delaware completed a change of domicile merger on August 26, 1999 with Bingham Canyon Corporation, a Nevada corporation.
 
On August 31, 2016, Bingham entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“Paradigm”). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Paradigm became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingham after the exchange transaction. Bingham is a holding company which, through Paradigm, is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
Bingham qualifies as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

• | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this report, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company accounting standard effective dates.
 
We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
For more details regarding this exemption, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies,” below.
 
Business Strategy
 
Bingham’s subsidiary, Paradigm, is a technology development and licensing company specializing in environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability. Paradigm markets new products and technologies through licensing and distributor agreements, joint ventures and partnerships, service contracts and equipment leasing and direct sales.
 
The company holds patent, intellectual property and/or distribution rights to innovative products and technologies. While a direct-sales capability is in place, it is not Paradigm’s intent to be the sole distributor of the technology products. In addition to the direct sales program, senior management will be responsible to develop the distribution and licensing program operations for the technology, to develop new opportunities and applications for the products, and to promote the brands. Paradigm senior management intends also to continue its pursuit of new technologies – particularly technologies which are complementary to or enhance applications opportunities for its existing products - upon which it can build and expand its business.
 
Paradigm’s has two commercially-ready product technologies: generation systems for Hydrolyte®, a highly effective sanitizer/disinfectant microbicide that is safe and not toxic for use around humans and animals; and, BioPlax®, a rapidly biodegradable plastic.
 
Hydrolyte® has been market tested with commercial customers and is ready for full scale commercial launch. Management intends to focus on leveraging the opportunities presented by Hydrolyte® in the short term and is in the first stage of a full commercial launch planned to commence in the second quarter of 2017. Management is reviewing options for BioPlax® product and applications opportunities, which may include the acquisition of additional related intellectual property rights or a decision not to pursue the commercialization of the technology in the near term.
 
Paradigm’s revenue stream is expected to be derived primarily from four sources: licensing and distributor agreements, joint ventures and partnerships, service contracts and equipment leasing and sales. In the 2017 launch, management plans to focus on establishing distributor operations and direct sales. Initially, direct sales are being managed by members of the senior management team. Subsequently, direct sales may be conducted by a subsidiary company(s) with targeted marketing and sales operations. Such subsidiary companies may be organized internally or acquired. Paradigm currently is in negotiations with three committed distributors who are preparing to undertake commercial operations in their respective regional markets. They are based in North Carolina, Mississippi and California. Management expects to finalize the details of the distribution agreements in the current second quarter.

In building out its marketing and distribution organization, Paradigm intends to develop strategic operating relationships with firms that are leaders in production, manufacturing, distributions, and sales within the various industries where the markets for our technologies exist. Management intends to scrutinize each potential business combination for strategic fit, successful and profitable operations, established business relationships, management capability, market position, and financial stability. It is believed that this strategy, properly executed, should allow for the most rapid possible rollout of the products and capture of market share.
 
Principal Technology: Hydrolyte® and Catholyte
 
Paradigm’s generator systems make two products in the cleansers, sanitizers and disinfectants category:
 
• | Hydrolyte®, the highly effective sanitizer / disinfectant with the lowest EPA toxicity rating possible (4); and,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Catholyte, a similarly safe and non-toxic mild detergent, degreaser and surfactant
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Both products are outputs of a single generation production process. Commercially, the primary product is Hydrolyte® and the second product of the process, Catholyte, is a very useful and effective product for which parallel markets exist and profitable revenue streams can be developed. Both products are generated using a single process of electrochemical activation (“ECA”) of the input ingredients derived from naturally-occurring salt minerals and water. 
 
The company has two registrations of Hydrolyte® with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as a microbial biocide and the company is in the process of completing a third. Hypochlorous acid solutions such as Hydrolyte® are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for cleaning and sanitizing applications and by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) for use in food processing. 
 
Hydrolyte® is a metastable, aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid, generated through the electrochemical process. It has a high redox potential (900 millivolts) and a greater biocidal effect than chlorine and other toxic chemicals. Hydrolyte® is 99.95% water + salt, rendering it safe and non-toxic to humans, yet it is instantly deadly on contact to every known fungus, bacteria or virus, including anthrax and E. coli. Using non-toxic Hydrolyte® in decontamination and sterilization processes generally eliminates the need for the use of other highly toxic chemical biocides (such as ammonia, chlorine bleach and glutaraldehyde) which are commonly used in sanitizing, disinfection and decontamination.
 
Although it has been well known for many years that an aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid (HOCL), commonly known as “anolyte”, can deliver extremely effective decontamination and sterilization results, previous problems in anolyte production technology had rendered its use economically infeasible in most applications. The two primary drawbacks with previous anolyte production technology were: the inability to generate anolyte in high enough concentrations (Parts Per Million – PPM) of the active ingredient, HOCL; and, the relatively short time that the product maintained its maximum decontaminative efficacy.
 
Paradigm’s new proprietary production, distribution and applications technologies have solved these problems. Its production equipment allows the Hydrolyte® solution to be produced consistently with specific, predetermined concentration of HOCL within the range of concentrations typically employed (150 to 500 PPM) as well as the desired pH level (the pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is) that may be desirable for any given application. To resolve the maintenance of efficacy issue, Paradigm has perfected generation (production) equipment which is small enough to be located on the customer’s facility, allowing for production-on-demand rather than maintaining stored product inventory. For customers who will not use enough product to justify the on-site equipment, the company intends to engage industry-specific distribution and commercial services companies to provide the products to end-user customers on a regular delivery schedule. The combination of the on-site generation and delivery solutions should assure end-users will always be supplied with fresh, full strength product.

Production: Hydrolyte® is generated with the company’s proprietary equipment. The production technology for Hydrolyte™ generates a product with predetermined PPM and pH properties, i.e., the equipment can be calibrated to deliver any desired PPM level; and, we believe it is superior to any other known production process or equipment available in the market today. The scalable Hydrolyte™ generation systems technology largely will be housed in portable and mobile units, which can be readily moved within a building or from site to site, although more permanent installations, probably employing larger generation systems, will be made in situations where such installation is appropriate or required.
Markets: The primary applications for the Hydrolyte® technology are in cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in a variety of market sectors and settings, including:
 
• | Institutional facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, correctional facilities and schools;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The agriculture industry for pre- and post-harvest disinfection of crops, sanitization in food processing, and certain applications in animal husbandry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The oil and gas industry where Hydrolyte® can provide a process to disinfect water used in hydraulic fracking processes (“frac water”) and to kill sulfite-producing microbes in “sour” oil and gas wells; and Catholyte can be used to clean equipment and aid in product recovery when applied “down hole”; and.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other potential market opportunities are available, e.g., disinfecting and sanitizing of water in public and private water systems and industrial waste-water systems.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Management has determined that the most direct paths to rapid revenue and earnings growth are in the institutional facilities and agriculture markets. The preponderance of business development and marketing resources are currently being devoted to these two markets. Management intends to also work to maintain the company’s position and expertise in the oil and gas industry to assure that current customer relationships are maintained, business opportunities at hand are pursued and that the company is properly positioned for a roll-out as, and when, drilling activity increases as anticipated.
 
Institutional Facilities: Hospitals, Health Care Facilities & Schools
 
Paradigm senior research and development personnel have worked for over a year with another company, Annihilare Medical Systems, Inc. (AMS) to perfect a specific model of Paradigm’s portable generation system to be deployed as a component in AMS’s state-of-the-art integrated product dispensing, tracking and management systems for applications in the institutional facilities market. This integrated technologies solution, branded as the Annihilyzer®, has been designed most particularly for hospitals, large long-term care, assisted living and nursing home facilities. In various configurations in can be deployed in other health care facilities including urgent care centers, medical, dental and veterinary offices. It is adaptable to deployment in schools, prisons, hotels and many other facilities. A complete and custom turn-key cleaning, disinfection and sterilization program solution can be provided to each facility.
 
At the physical core of the Annihilyzer® solution is Paradigm’s on-site generation equipment. The Catholyte product generated in the Annihilyzer® is branded by AMS as Catholyte. It is a non-toxic mild detergent and degreaser that is easily applied using mop buckets, sprayers and floor cleaning machines for basic janitorial cleaning purposes.
 
Paradigm’s generation equipment is housed in the Annihilyzer® kiosk which also contains a managed disbursement and bottling system which tracks inventory production, containerization and use. Spray bottles and other containers are labeled when filled or refilled with product identification and date of production using printed labels and radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) tags. Reading these labels and tags before use assures that the correct and “fresh” product is always being used. Each room is also given an RFID tag. By reading the RFID room tags with a mobile app in a smartphone, the system tracks what is cleaned and disinfected, when, with what product, and by whom. The kiosk is Wi-Fi connected to smartphones so it can receive and store all of the data collected. The data can be used to generate a complete record of all cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing activity, including personnel time and task data – a cost saving convenience to management.

Paradigm intends to deploy its on-site production equipment under service contracts, charging an installation and set-up fee followed by monthly contract fees (some pricing models may include, or be based on, a price per gallon of product used). The equipment will be deployed and maintained through Paradigm-licensed commercial services companies that provide the on-site support as required. The product generators and other components of the on-site systems will be monitored remotely by a contracting company which is highly experienced and expert in remote monitoring and response systems. The precise nature of any functional problems that may occur with any of the system’s components will be automatically communicated via the internet to the monitoring and control center. The problems are then resolved through a three-tiered problem response system: first by remote access to the computerized system controls, second by an on-site technician call, and third through a “rapid replacement” program. If problems are not resolved by the first or second tier responses, in the tier three rapid replacement response, Paradigm would overnight ship replacement parts or, if necessary a complete kiosk or system and have the defective unit returned for repair.
 
Agricultural Antimicrobial Pesticide
 
In the agricultural sector our microbicide will be branded as “Go Greenlyte Firsttm”. Our testing and field trials indicate that it can provide pre-harvest disinfection and decontamination solutions for any number of field crops that are affected by various bacterial and fungal pathogens. Through USDA grants and multiple studies by universities around the world, hypochlorous acid solutions have been tested and proven effective against yield-reducing crop pathogens in post-harvest applications to include sanitizing at point of harvest, point of packing, and points of sale.
While Go Greenlyte FirstTM is effective in these post-harvest applications, Paradigm’s major objective is to deliver solutions for pre-harvest pathogen contaminations, where a multitude of microbial infestations of many crops still need effective solutions that will qualify for regulatory approvals necessary to bring the treatment solution into commercial use. Paradigm’s agricultural research program is intended to support a continuous rollout of scientifically tested and certified applications for the treatment and prevention of numerous specific microbial infestations of a wide variety of crops. This research activity is expected to capture the test data required for regulatory approvals, and market acceptance of, the specific uses for the specific crops.
 
While company management and technical staff and consultants are certain of the ability of Go Greenlyte FirstTM to kill virtually any microbe; substantial testing and documentation are required to determine optimal protocols for treatment, including application concentrations, volumes, and frequency, as well as optimal delivery techniques (which could be any or all of: root drenching, foliar spray or injection) needed to produce the most effective and least costly solutions to microbial infestations. It must also be demonstrated and certified by independent third-party testing that the treatment does no harm to the plants or the crops to be harvested and leaves no chemical residual inside the crop.
 
Paradigm has undertaken the establishment of a long-term testing and field trial program with an independent agricultural pesticide research firm to determine the feasibility of pre-harvest use of Go Greenlyte FirstTM to defeat various microbial infestations in as many different crops as possible. Management has identified several microbial crop infestation problems for which safe and effective treatment solutions have yet to be found and for which problems there is preliminary evidence that a properly researched Go Greenlyte First™ treatment protocol could provide such a solution. Management anticipates positive results from independent testing leading to the creation, over time, of multiple business opportunity targets on which to build a solid consistent, long-term revenue stream with solid growth potential for the foreseeable future.
 
Testing/Research: In the third quarter of 2015, an opportunity was identified for research into a possibly significant opportunity for commercialization of a formulation of the company’s Hydrolyte® product, that was branded as Go Greenlyte FirstTM. A critical agricultural market was seeking solutions to eradicate a serious and threatening microbial infestation. The company’s management determined that our product’s microbicide capability could provide a readily deployable and effective solution to the problem. Three months (late 2015 and early 2016) were spent determining the research requirements, target-market requirements and the potential for successful commercialization in the identified market. Two seasoned professionals with the necessary expertise were brought on board, and the project was launched from the company’s facility in Little River, South Carolina, during the fourth quarter of 2015.

To demonstrate that the company could provide a viable solution, research protocols were developed and a series of laboratory tests and preliminary trials were performed at a major university by agricultural scientists who were experts on the crop and the infestation. The results of these tests and the trial analysis were very favorable, showing a 100 percent kill rate on the treated microbes in the laboratory and a very high kill rate in the field trial environment.
 
Encouraged by early laboratory and field trial results, management secured the services of a consulting specialist in the target crop and the microbial pathogen causing the disease. Working with the consultant, management determined the market to be viable for the use of the company’s Go Greenlyte FirstTM in effectively treating the disease, as well as deterring the disease from infecting healthy fruit producing plants or reinfecting plants that were previously successfully treated.
 
The second field trial, during nine months of 2016, was extensive and involved a larger-scale operation over a greater length of time. Specific third-party reports to the company indicated “good to excellent control of the disease source, economically feasible, EPA registration possible” and a continuing very high field kill rate. Upon receiving these results, the Company began developing plans to make certain it will be prepared to “supply fluid product in commercial quantities.”
 
Preventive, curative and health maintenance programs for the application of the Company’s Go Greenlyte First™ were discussed and developed, with input and encouragement by the fruit’s national growing association, as well as from keenly interested educational institutions.
 
In March 2017, the company began a much larger-scale field test of our product on a 20-acre plot that has research subject plants showing widespread presence of the disease. We, and our consulting specialist, expect to replicate and to validate previous results and further define the best possible methodology and protocols for effective application of the Go Greenlyte FirstTM solution. If the results of the current trial are as positive, as expected, management hopes to achieve the following goals in 2017:
 
• | Finalize regulatory approvals to enter the market as the only-known resource for resolving this agricultural disease with no known negative effects to the fruit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finalize designs for, and assemble, large volume product generation and delivery systems best suited to the agricultural working environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue additional EPA approvals for additional applications in the agricultural markets; and,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finalize business plan for marketing, distribution, sales and deployment of product in this market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oil and Gas Industry
 
World market prices for oil decreased during the past several years in response to increased production coming on line simultaneously with a softening of the growth in demand. The oil and gas industry in the U.S. and elsewhere has experienced unprecedented expansion and prosperity due to an influx of technological advances enabling the discovery and accurate location and identification of significant domestic oil and gas reserves. Advances in drilling technology, fracturing equipment and chemical methodology greatly enhanced recovery rates and revenue growth. This growth surge in supply reduced the United States’ dependency on foreign oil, and, we believe, contributed to lowering the U.S. trade deficit, reducing unemployment rates in oil producing areas, reducing heating and cooling costs, and providing lucrative investment opportunities. However, during 2014 and 2015 the steadily increasing supply of oil on a global scale led to reduced prices and decreased drilling activity in the U.S. From a June 20, 2014 price of $115 per barrel, the price dropped to historic lows below $30 in February 2016. The drop in the market price of oil led to a great reduction in drilling activity causing a corresponding loss of opportunities to sell the company’s products and services in the oil & gas industry. By the end of 2016, the price of oil had recovered to the $50 to $55 range. A stable market in this price range is expected to lead to renewed opportunities in this industry in 2017. As opportunities emerge, the company plans to use oil-field service companies to market and distribute our Hydrolyte® and Catholyte products to their clients/customers. Management is currently seeking an appropriate opportunity to reenter this market.

Management believes that the benefits of our proven technologies continue to be desirable for, and should continue to be used in, hydraulic fracturing drilling worldwide. Some of the benefits of our products and systems include: elimination of highly toxic chemicals currently used for decontamination, reduced negative environmental impact, reduced recovery costs, improved product quality, and potentially opening new areas for oil and gas retrieval. As a result, management is preparing for expanding business opportunities in this sector in the near to mid-term future. As part of this preparation, Paradigm is developing a large-scale system utilizing Hydrolyte® to decontaminate water and fluid going “down hole” in oil and gas-well drilling; and to decontaminate recovered “frac” water for reuse in the fracking process. Operational experience has shown that Hydrolyte® not only effectively decontaminates the water supply of microbes, but also does not cause corrosive damage to gas and oil recovery equipment; nor does it cause any loss of efficacy to the other chemicals, additives, and propellants currently used in drilling and fracking processes.
 
Hydrolyte® also addresses another problem in the oil and gas industry. In a separate application, Hydrolyte® can be used to reduce the sulfur content of crude oil in the ground. There are sulfite-producing microbes in crude oil which cause higher levels of hydrogen sulfide (“H2S”) and “sour” wells with sour crude oil which is less valuable than “sweet” crude which has low H2S. It has been demonstrated that Hydrolyte® is effective in reducing or eliminating these microbes, thus improving the quality and value of the oil recovered from the treated well.
 
Hydrolyte® can reduce the costs of transporting contaminated water from the wellbore to a treatment facility and back for reuse, thus reducing the need for construction of water processing capacity, providing a substantial reduction in the costs of drilling and enabling a sustainable increase in efficiency. The company intends to maintain an active marketing program; and, expects that there will be renewed opportunities for revenue growth from the frac drilling and related oil-field applications.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution of Hydrolyte®
 
Marketing and sales activities were minimal in 2016 while management focused on the final stage of product development, establishing supply chain agreements, and building sufficient physical production capacity to meet expected demand. Distributor and customer relationships were established through management’s existing contacts and should provide a solid base of sales and revenue after the second quarter 2017 launch of this new and expanded stage of operations. Paradigm has preliminary agreements with three prospective distributors and expects these agreements to be finalized and result in full commercial distribution operations in the second quarter, concurrent with the launch. Management has additional distribution opportunities under development in multiple markets and intends to expand the distribution network in 2017. Management, working with consultants well-known to management, intends to continue to seek and establish distributor and/or joint venture opportunities and agreements for the marketing and sales of Paradigm’s products and services.
 
While a major portion of the marketing effort is expected to be provided directly by our distributors, Paradigm intends to put in place its own formal marketing program with expanded participation in industry trade shows, advertising in trade publications, internet marketing and sales support, and an impactful and credible company image, which integrates all products and technologies under one cohesive appearance. All marketing and branding material will incorporate a consistent look and display prominent logo recognition.
 
A direct sales function is expected to be established to support large customers and pursue promising joint venture opportunities. Paradigm expects to use its production, operations and research and development facility in Little River, South Carolina to display the products and technologies of the company. This will provide a meeting and demonstration area where working models and simulations will allow first-hand interaction and live demonstrations for interested parties. On-site visits to existing installations and technology partner’s facilities may be sponsored by the company.

The Annihilyzer® Systems sales program has begun with agreements with three prospective customers for pilot/demonstration installations at their facilities. It is expected that the pilot installations will be completed in the second quarter. The pre-deployment preparation has been completed for the first installation which is scheduled for early April at a school selected by the education department of a major western city.
 
Production, Assembly and Principal Suppliers
 
Hydrolyte® Generation and Equipment Production: Paradigm moved into its new operations, research and development and production facility in Little River, South Carolina on December 15, 2016. The research, development and testing space was suitable and functional as already built. Testing and limited systems assembly is currently being conducted at the new facility. A new design and layout for a final systems assembly area and an expanded testing area was finalized in March 2017 and the internal improvements and equipment installation is expected to be completed and fully operational by July 1, 2017.
 
Paradigm’s product generation systems will be assembled and tested in the company’s Little River production facility and shipped directly to customer or distributor sites. Some requiring special enclosures will be shipped to Werks Manufacturing.
 
Annihilyzer® Systems Assembly: Generation systems assembled in Little River and other outsourced components for the Annihilyzer® System will be shipped to Werks Manufacturing Inc., Ft. Wayne, Indiana for final assembly in the Annihilyzer® kiosk. The kiosk is manufactured by Werks using patent-pending technology owned by Werks. Werks manufacturing technology enables the near-field communications (NFC) communications and information systems functions of the Annihilyzer® to work. Kiosk manufacture and system assembly is performed by Werks on a purchase order basis.
Competition 
 
In all our target markets, Paradigm will compete directly with large firms selling competing, but toxic, legacy cleanser and disinfectant products. These competitors have longer operating histories, more experience, substantially greater financial and human resources, greater size, more substantial research and development and marketing operations, established distribution channels and are well positioned in the market to fight aggressively to defend their market share. However, the combined markets in which Paradigm is engaged are so massive that its competitive position as non-toxic and, in a significant number of applications, less expensive should allow Paradigm to prosper.
 
There are a limited number of potential competitors providing some form of anolyte-based biocide. Based on management’s research these companies are largely in early operating stages, concentrated in local or regional markets and have no technology or pricing advantage. These include Aquaox, Ecologic Solutions, Integrated Environmental Technologies, MIOX Corporation, and eWater Advantage.
 
In the institutional facilities and agricultural industries, Paradigm believes that its proprietary integrated technologies solutions in production, distribution, applications management and tracking should provide a competitive advantage in direct competition. In the oil and gas industry Paradigm has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiencies of its products and processes and commercial acceptance from its customers. It is well positioned with respect to other companies providing anolyte-based biocides. In the water treatment industry, “Filtering” technologies similar to Hydrolyte™ range from simple decanting to distillation. They are typically implemented as multi-stage processes to attain water quality standards for the planned reuse. Where that planned reuse is desired to be biocide-free, leaving no residual biocides in the water output, Paradigm’s technology has a distinct competitive advantage. Where there is less or no concern regarding residuals, other methods often will have a cost advantage, limiting opportunities in this sector.

Intellectual Property
 
EPA product registrations of disinfectants and pesticides allow the registered products to be sold and distributed with labels identifying specific laboratory tested and proven kill claims of its effectiveness against specific microbial pathogens. In December of 2016 and first quarter of 2017, Paradigm acquired two separate EPA product registrations. The first was a sub-registration (#82341-1-92108), accepted by the EPA on December 15, 2016, which provides for entry into the facilities and agricultural markets described previously in this document. The company is actively pursuing sales under this registration and label.
 
On March 13, 2017, paradigm entered into a Registration Transfer Agreement (“Transfer Agreement”) and a Data License and Assignment Agreement (“Data Agreement”) with IET, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the public company, Integrated Environmental Technologies, Ltd. (“IEVM” OTC:BB). Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, the company received the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Registration number 82341-4 for Excelyte® VET for a one-time fee of $125,000. The company paid a deposit in the amount of $75,000 on March 14, 2017 and the remaining $50,000 is due to IEVM on or before April 9, 2017. Pursuant to the Data Agreement, the company was granted a non-exclusive license to utilize certain efficacy test data owned by IET, Inc. for a one-time fee of $25,000, payable by the company on or before April 24, 2017. We are in the process of completing the transfer documentation required to be submitted to the EPA to affect the transfer. The company also has a third EPA product registration application in process.


Paradigm, pursuant to an agreement with Annihilyzer, Inc., an amendment to which agreement is currently in negotiation with the management of Annihilyzer, Inc., intends to acquire the complete intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets and patent rights to the hardware, firmware and software comprising the product inventory generation, disbursement, containerization, tracking and reporting system, trademarked as the Annihilyzer® System. The Annihilyzer® System is designed to be employed on-site large facilities. The company already owns IP rights in the generation system employed in this integrated technology system. If successfully completed, the acquisition will result in ownership of the components, patent pending software and firmware, developed by Annihilare Medical Systems and held in their affiliate company Annihilyzer, Inc. A definitive agreement is expected to be executed in the second quarter 2017.
 
Paradigm has developed proprietary know-how related to the reactor cells and generation systems that generate our Hydrolyte® and Catholyte products. Our two models have nominal daily output of 100 to 120 gallons per day and 250 to 300 gallons per day, respectively, of Hydrolyte® solution @ 500 parts per million of HOCL.
 
Paradigm continues, through its research and development program, to perfect the production innovation, know-how, trade secrets and patentable innovations incorporated into the improved production, inventory management and reporting systems. Current focus is on customizing system and equipment design to suite the production parameters and conditions in various specific venues and applications, e.g., agricultural field setting vs. packing house or oil and gas field.
 
Research and Development
 
Paradigm’s research and development costs for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $29,871, $75,026 and $222,313, respectively. During that period, Paradigm conducted testing of the application of the Hydrolyte® technology in the oil and gas industry; as a biocide in institutional facilities, such as, hospitals, jails and medical facilities; and in agriculture and food processing.

In 2016 Paradigm invested $147,917 in research and development. Products and systems for the institutional facilities market have been largely finalized and are in production to supply the 2017 launch. Management estimates that 2017 research and development expenditures will be approximately $250,000 to support on-going laboratory and field-trial work in the agricultural sector and continued generator and other equipment and systems engineering and testing. The company expects to maintain a robust research and development program in agricultural, commercial and industrial opportunities and applications for the foreseeable future.
 
In October 2015, Paradigm entered an agreement with Florida Pesticide Research, Inc. to conduct agricultural research intended to support an aggressive rollout of tested and certified applications for the treatment and prevention of numerous specific microbial infestations of a wide variety of crops. While company management, technical staff and consultants are confident of Hydrolyte®’s ability to kill virtually any microbe, testing is required to determine proper application concentrations, volumes, frequency and delivery techniques (which could be any or all of: root drenching, foliar spray or injection) needed to be most effective and least costly. It also must be demonstrated that the treatment does no harm to the plants or the product to be harvested and that no harmful residual remains in the crop because of the treatment. Management intends to maintain and expand the testing and demonstration program currently in place to other crops in order to target various additional crop infestation problems for the foreseeable future.
 
Government Regulations and Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Paradigm is not aware of any existing or probable government regulations that would negatively impact our operations. The company is currently seeking EPA registration of our technologies. As a licensor of water treatment technology, it is not subject to government regulations for the removal of oils, solids and pathogens from water, other than normal safety standards and certifications (such as UL or CE) for goods that we manufacture for demonstrations and joint ventures, and our product lines. However, prospective customers are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing water quality, environmental quality and pollution control. To date, compliance with government regulations has had no material effect on the company’s operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. Paradigm is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities.
 
In addition, Paradigm’s prospective customers will be subject to the Clean Water Act which regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams and other waters of the U.S. (as defined in the statute) from a variety of sources. If wastewater or runoff from facilities or operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires that person to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. The federal government may delegate Clean Water Act authority to the states.
