Business Overview
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and ISR uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States. The Company also extracts and recovers vanadium as market conditions warrant and is also planning to commence the commercial production of REE carbonate in 2021, another byproduct of the uranium recovery process. Energy Fuels owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the “Nichols Ranch Project”), which is a uranium recovery facility with a licensed capacity of 2 million pounds of U3O8 per year, and the Alta Mesa Project in Texas (the “Alta Mesa Project”), which is a fully-permitted ISR uranium production facility with a licensed capacity of 1.5 million pounds of U3O8 per year, both of which are currently on standby. In addition, Energy Fuels owns the White Mesa Mill, which is the only conventional uranium and vanadium recovery facility operating in the United States with a licensed capacity of over 8 million pounds of U3O8 per year. In addition to uranium, the Mill can also recover vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah and from time to time from solutions in its tailings impoundment system, as market conditions warrant, as well as an REE carbonate from various uranium- and REE-bearing ores. The Company also owns uranium and uranium/vanadium properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and evaluation, as well as fully-permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects on standby. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “alternate feed materials,” at its White Mesa Mill.

ISR Operations
The Company conducts its ISR activities through (i) its Nichols Ranch Project in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (“Uranerz”), and (ii) its Alta Mesa Project in south Texas, which the Company acquired in June 2016 through its acquisition of Mesteña Uranium, LLC (“Mesteña”), which is now named EFR Alta Mesa LLC (“EFR Alta Mesa”). 
The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the “Nichols Ranch Plant”); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the “Nichols Ranch Wellfields”); (iii) additional licensed ISR wellfields planned for future production (the “Jane Dough Property”), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the “Hank Project”), which will include an ISR satellite processing plant (the “Hank Satellite Plant”) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the “Hank Property”). See “The Nichols Ranch ISR Project” under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the West North Butte property (the “West North Butte Property”), the North Rolling Pin property (the “North Rolling Pin Property”), and the Reno Creek property (the “Reno Creek Property”), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the “Arkose Mining Venture”), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. The Company subsequently sold the Reno Creek Property to Uranium Energy Corp. in May 2018. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties - Other ISR Projects” under Item 2, below.
The Nichols Ranch Project is an ISR facility currently on standby that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The uranium-bearing groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant where the uranium is extracted from the water. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.
Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered approximately 6,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Nichols Ranch Project. The Company expects to recover limited quantities of U3O8 from the Nichols Ranch Project in 2021. See “Outlook: ISR Activities.”
The Alta Mesa Project is a fully licensed, permitted and constructed ISR processing facility that has an operating capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year and comprises a total of 195,501 contiguous acres of land. The Alta Mesa Project is currently on standby and ready to resume production as market conditions warrant. It is expected to be able to reach commercial production levels with limited required capital within approximately twelve months of a production decision. See “The Alta Mesa Project” under Item 2, below. 
Conventional Operations
The Company conducts its conventional uranium, REE and vanadium extraction and recovery activities through its White Mesa Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium, REE and vanadium processing facility in the United States. The White Mesa Mill located near Blanding, Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of the Company’s uranium and uranium/vanadium projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with third parties in the region as market conditions warrant.
The White Mesa Mill is licensed to process 2,000 tons of mineralized material per day. It is primarily a uranium recovery facility but can also recover REEs and vanadium. In addition, the Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional ore, referred to as “alternate feed materials,” for the recovery of uranium, alone or in combination with other metals. In this regard, the Company is currently evaluating a number of potential alternate feed materials for the recovery of REEs in addition to uranium.
The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements, as market conditions warrant. Over the years, the Company’s own, and third-party owned, conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico have been both active and on standby in response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a campaign basis, the White Mesa Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds of U3O8 per year from conventional sources, including its La Sal Project, Daneros Project, and Tony M property in Utah; its Arizona 1 Project and Pinenut Project (which is currently almost fully reclaimed) in Arizona; and alternate feed materials. During 2016, the Mill recovered a total of 680,000 pounds of U3O8, of which 433,000 pounds were recovered from conventional materials from the Company’s Pinenut Project and 248,000 pounds from processing alternate feed materials. During 2017, the Mill recovered 310,000 pounds of U3O8 from processing pond solutions and 1,000,000 pounds from processing alternate feed materials, of which a total of 360,000 pounds were for the Company’s account and 950,000 pounds 
14


were for the account of third parties. During 2018, the Mill recovered 215,719 pounds of U3O8 from processing pond solutions and 561,628 pounds from processing alternate feed materials, of which a total of 82,709 pounds were for the Company’s account and 448,919 pounds were for the account of third parties under a tolling arrangement. In late 2018, the White Mesa Mill shifted to producing vanadium from pond solutions and, during 2019, 1,807,732 pounds of V2O5 were produced from pond solutions for its own account, and no uranium was produced at the Mill. During 2020, the Company recovered approximately 190,500 pounds of U3O8 at the White Mesa Mill from in-circuit uranium inventories extracted from the recent vanadium pond-return campaign, and from alternate feed materials, as well as approximately 67,000 pounds of V2O5 from in-process solutions from the recent vanadium pond-return campaign. In addition, the Company produced, using its existing infrastructure and pursuant to its existing Radioactive Materials License and Groundwater Discharge Permit, an REE carbonate concentrate on a pilot scale at the Mill from a sample of monazite sands from a third-party supplier – the first such initiative in North America in over 20 years. See “Outlook: Conventional Extraction and Recovery Activities.”
During 2021, the Company expects to recover approximately 46,400 pounds of U3O8 at the White Mesa Mill, including uranium recovered through the processing of REE- and uranium-bearing natural monazite ore. The Company also expects to commence commercial production of a mixed REE carbonate in 2021 and to produce approximately 3,000 tons of mixed REE carbonate at the Mill. Subject to successfully ramping-up production of a salable product during 2021, the Company expects to sell some or all of this intermediate REE product to REE separation facilities outside the U.S. To the extent not sold, the Company expects to stockpile mixed REE carbonate at the Mill for future separation and other downstream REE processing at the Mill or elsewhere. See “Outlook: Rare Earth Sales.”
In addition, the Company currently has approximately 126,800 pounds of U3O8 contained in stockpiled alternate feed material and ore inventory that can be recovered in the future for the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve or as general market conditions warrant. In addition, there remains an estimated 1.5-3 million pounds of solubilized recoverable V2O5 inventory remaining in the tailings facility awaiting future recovery, as market conditions may warrant. See “Outlook: Conventional Extraction and Recovery Activities.”
The Company continues to receive and process alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill, including low-grade ore from the cleanup of a conventional mine in northwest New Mexico. At the Company’s permitted Pinyon Plain Project (formerly, the “Canyon Project”), standby and environmental compliance activities continued during 2020, including submission of an application to replace the Company’s existing General Permit with an Individual Permit, as issued by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. The timing to extract and process mineralized material from the Pinyon Plain Project will be based on market conditions, available financing, and sales requirements. The Company’s Pinenut Project, where mineral extraction activities occurred until September 2015, is now depleted and has been almost fully reclaimed, with only a two-acre disturbance associated with a monitor well still remaining. The Company also pursued a small-scale test mining campaign targeting vanadium at its La Sal Complex in 2018 and early 2019, along with rehabilitation of existing mine workings, which ceased in early 2020. All of the Company’s other conventional properties and projects are currently in the permitting process or on standby pending improvements in market conditions. No third-party conventional properties are active at this time.
The Company also owns the Sheep Mountain Project (the “Sheep Mountain Project”), which is a conventional uranium extraction project located in Wyoming. Due to its distance from the White Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source of feed material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of permitted open pit and underground extraction components (the “Sheep Mountain Extraction Operation”) and a planned processing facility to process extracted mineralized material (the “Sheep Mountain Processing Operation”), which has not yet been permitted.
The Company’s principal conventional properties include the following:

Mineral Exploration
Energy Fuels holds a number of exploration properties in the Colorado Plateau, White Canyon, Grants, Arizona Strip, and Powder River Basin Districts. Energy Fuels conducted intermittent exploration drilling on numerous projects in the period from February 2007 through December 2013. Several of those projects have been abandoned or sold. No further exploration drilling has been performed at these properties since 2013. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties” under Item 2, below.
Potential Sale of Certain Non-Core Assets
The Company is in discussions with several parties to potentially sell certain of its non-core assets, including the Tony M Mine, Daneros Mine and Rim Mine, although there are currently no binding offers, and there can be no assurance at this time that a sale will be completed.
The Company’s Rare Earth Elements Business
On December 14, 2020, the Company announced it entered into a three-year supply agreement with The Chemours Company (NYSE: CC) (“Chemours”) to acquire a minimum of 2,500 tons per year of natural monazite sands, one of the highest-grade REE ores in the world, from Chemours’ Offerman Mineral Sand Plant located in Georgia. The Company expects to process this monazite at the Mill, starting in 2021, to recover the contained uranium and to produce a marketable mixed REE carbonate as a step toward re-establishing a fully-integrated U.S. REE supply chain. 
On March 1, 2021, the Company and Neo Performance Materials (“Neo”) jointly announced that they had entered into an agreement in principle, subject to completion of definitive agreements, under which Energy Fuels will process natural monazite sands into an REE Carbonate beginning in March or April 2021 and ship a portion of that production to Neo's rare earth separations facility in Sillamäe, Estonia ("Silmet"). Neo will then process the REE Carbonate into separated rare earth materials for use in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth-based advanced materials. Silmet is the only operational rare earth separations facility in Europe and has been separating rare earths into commercial value-added products for more than 50 years. Implementation of this initiative is subject to successful ramp-up to commercial-scale operations, execution of definitive agreements, and optimization of the companies' production processes.
Upon a successful ramp-up of this program, the Company will be the first U.S. company in several years to produce a marketable mixed REE concentrate ready for separation on a commercial scale. The Company estimates that the amount of REEs contained in the monazite sands to be supplied by Chemours will equal close to 10% of total current U.S. REE demand, as contained in end-use products.
The Company expects to recover uranium from the monazite sands and produce a commercially salable mixed REE carbonate containing approximately 71% total rare earth oxide (“TREO”) on a dry basis. This REE product will be ready for REE separation, which is the next step in producing usable REE products. The Company is also in discussions with other entities to acquire additional supplies of natural monazite sands and is working with the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) to evaluate 
the potential to process other types of REE and uranium bearing ores at the Mill produced from coal-based resources. Because the Company is obtaining monazite from existing mining facilities in Georgia (and potentially elsewhere) and utilizing its existing Mill, it will avoid the significant time and cost required to license and develop new facilities, which the Company believes may, in time, result in among the lowest-cost REE production in the western world. In addition, since the monazite sands are currently being separated from other mineral sands in Georgia and elsewhere, the Company will only incur the cost to acquire the monazite, thereby avoiding mining costs and associated risks. The Company expects to sell some or all of its mixed REE carbonate to Neo and to potentially other buyers in Europe and/or Asia until an REE separation facility is established in the U.S., after which it expects to sell its REE carbonate to buyers in both the U.S. and Europe. The Company is also evaluating the potential to perform REE separation, and potentially other downstream REE activities, including metal-making and alloying, in the future at the Mill or elsewhere in the U.S.
The Company’s mixed REE carbonate production from monazite sand ores is expected to utilize only a very small amount of the Mill’s ore production capacity. The Company expects to acquire a minimum 2,500 tons of monazite sands in 2021 from Chemours, alone, and has a goal to increase production in the future to approximately 15,000 tons or more of monazite sands per year. For comparison, the Mill is licensed and designed to process 2,000 tons of ore per day on average, or 720,000 tons of ore per year. Therefore, 2,500 tons of monazite per year represents less than 0.4% of the Mill’s ore throughput capacity, and 15,000 tons would represent approximately 2% of its capacity. If the Company is successful in securing 15,000 tons of ore similar to the Chemours monazite, the Company would be able to produce approximately 50% of current U.S. REE demand in a mixed REE carbonate. Furthermore, since monazite is typically comprised of approximately 55% recoverable uranium and REEs, the total volume of resulting waste is significantly lower than for most other Mill feeds. The Company currently has 1.5 million tons of existing capacity in its fully-constructed 1,000-year design tailings impoundments. Therefore, the annual waste streams from monazite ore processing are expected to represent less than 1% of existing tailings capacity. 
REEs are a group of 17 chemical elements (the 15 elements in the lanthanum series, plus yttrium and scandium) that have a variety of industrial, energy, and defense uses, including automotive components, communications technology, clean energy production, consumer electronics, defense systems, advanced magnets, lasers and numerous other applications. 
Typical natural monazite sands from the southeast U.S. average about 55% TREO and 0.20% uranium, which is the typical grade of uranium found in uranium mines that have historically fed the Mill. Of the 55% TREO typically found in the monazite sands, the neodymium and praseodymium (“NdPr”) comprise approximately 22% of the TREO. NdPr are among the most valuable of the REEs, as they are the key ingredient in the manufacture of high-strength permanent magnets which are essential to the lightweight and powerful motors required in electric vehicles (“EVs”) and permanent magnet wind turbines used for renewable energy generation, as well as to an array of other modern technologies, including mobile devices and defense applications. The Company is primarily focused on NdPr and, to a lesser extent, La, Ce and Sm.
The REE supply chain starts at the mine. REEs are mined both as a primary target and as a byproduct, which is the case for Chemours’ Offerman Mineral Sand Plant, where the natural monazite sands are physically separated from the other mined sands mined by Chemours. Mining creates an ore, which in the case of the Chemours material is the natural monazite sands that are physically separated from the other mined mineral sands. The ore will then go through a process of cracking and cleaning at the Mill that may include acids or caustic solutions, elevated temperature, and pressure to recover the uranium and free the REEs from the mineral matrix. After removal of the uranium, which will be sold into the commercial nuclear fuel cycle for the creation of carbon-free nuclear energy, this solution will be cleaned from any remaining deleterious elements (including remaining radioactive elements) and made into an REE carbonate, which will be in a form acceptable as a solvent extraction (“SX”) feedstock ready for separation. Solvent extraction facilities will then use solvents and a series of mixer-settlers for the separation of the rare earths in the REE carbonate from each other and to create the desired purified REEs (often as oxides) for the market or particular end user. REE oxides are typically sold to various markets, depending on the use. REE oxides can be made into REE metals and metal alloys, which are used for magnets and other applications. At this time, the Mill intends to produce an REE carbonate, which it intends to sell to Neo and potentially other third-party separation facilities for separation into individual REEs. The Mill is evaluating the potential to perform REE separation, and potentially other downstream REE activities, including metal-making and alloying, in the future at the Mill or elsewhere in the United States.
According to a 2017 report by the United States Geological Survey (“USGS”), China has controlled more than 90% of the global supply of REEs since the late 1990s and has placed restrictions on REE exports since 2010. While China consumes the most REEs in its manufacturing industries, much of it is consumed in the manufacture of end-use goods for export and by non-Chinese companies operating within China. REE separation facilities are additionally located in Vietnam, India, as well as Silmet in Estonia and use a variety of feedstocks and sources, with small-scale or experimental operational facilities located elsewhere (Russia included). The REE industry was primarily based on material extracted from monazites from 1891-1965, and 
monazites continued to provide substantial material through the late 1990s. The subsequent decline in monazite production stemmed from increased environmental concerns related to handling radioactivity and the resulting waste, with facilities struggling to adequately address the ore’s uranium and thorium content and stringent licensing requirements. The Mill, however, is licensed to process uranium and thorium-bearing materials and does not face those issues. 
More recently, China began importing monazite and recovering its uranium as a feed source for the nuclear industry, while concurrently producing REE concentrate as a feed source for the REE industry. The Company sees its production of REE carbonate as the first step in an effort to restore the rare earth supply chain in the U.S., where one currently does not exist. Multiple potential domestic sources of mined mineral sands, including monazites, exist in North America and are potential feedstocks for the Mill; in addition, there is one producer of REEs from hard rock mining in California, which currently ships its material to China. On a global level, there is a potential to acquire natural monazite sands from the following locations: Australia, South Africa, Madagascar, Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Russia, and others. 
There are a number of risks inherent to the Company’s REE activities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under Item 1A, below.
Development of the Business -- Major Transactions over the Past Five Years
Over the past five years, the Company has completed the following major transactions:
•In June 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Uranerz. Under that transaction, the Company acquired the Nichols Ranch Project, the Hank Project, the Reno Creek Property, the West North Butte Property, the North Rolling Pin Property, the Company’s interest in the Arkose Mining Venture, uranium sales contracts, and other assets, as well as the shares of Uranerz, which holds those assets; 
•In two separate transactions in February and November of 2015, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the Wate Project through the acquisition of Wate Mining Company LLC; 
•In June 2016, the Company acquired EFR Alta Mesa and its primary asset, the Alta Mesa Project; 
•In May 2018, the Company sold its non-core Reno Creek Property to Uranium Energy Corp.; and
•In August 2018, the Company acquired royalties on the Nichols Ranch Project, along with royalties on several operating, standby and advanced-stage ISR projects in Wyoming owned and operated by Power Resources, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cameco Corporation.
2020 Corporate Developments
On February 10, 2020, the federal executive Budget was published for fiscal year 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021). The Budget “Supports Nuclear Fuel Cycle Capabilities,” and stated that “[o]n July 12, 2019, the President determined that ‘...the United States uranium industry faces significant challenges in producing uranium domestically and that this is an issue of national security.’ The President’s Budget establishes a U.S. Uranium Reserve to provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption.” Table 25-1 of the Budget sought congressional appropriations of $150 million per year over the next 10 years (totaling $1.5 billion over that time frame) for uranium purchases. For fiscal 2021 (October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021), the Budget sought an appropriation of $150 million, “to remain available until expended,” as the appropriation for the first year of this 10-year program. On December 27, 2020, the U.S. Congress signed into law the COVID-Relief and Omnibus Spending Bill, which includes $75 million for the establishment of a strategic U.S. Uranium Reserve. Because the U.S. Uranium Reserve has yet to be established for the United States at this time, however, there can be no certainty as to the outcome of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, if any, including the process for and details of its development, or for any further evaluations by the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group established in July 2019 to “develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production.” 
On February 20, 2020, the Company closed a bought deal public offering of Common Shares made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated February 13, 2020 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as lead underwriter and sole book-runner, and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Eight Capital, Haywood Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the “Offering”). Pursuant to the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 11,300,000 Common Shares at a price of $1.47 per share for gross proceeds of $16.61 million. The Company received net proceeds, after commissions and fees, of $15.14 million from the Offering.
On February 28, 2020, the Company filed an updated technical report, including a Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”), for its Sheep Mountain Project in Fremont County, Wyoming on SEDAR in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and in accordance with Canadian Institute Mining’s (“CIM”) Best Practice Guidelines for the Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The technical report, entitled Sheep Mountain Uranium Project, Fremont County, Wyoming, USA, Updated Preliminary Feasibility Study, National Instrument 43-101 
Technical Report, Amended and Restated and dated February 28, 2020, was authored by Douglas L. Beahm, P.E., P.G., Principal Engineer of BRS Inc., who is independent of the Company and a Qualified Person pursuant to NI 43-101. The updated PFS incorporated recent changes in CIM mineral resource requirements and changes in the Sheep Mountain Project mine plan.
On May 6, 2020, the Company announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire from GeoInstruments Logging LLC all of its Prompt Fission Neutron (“PFN”) technology and equipment, including all of its related intellectual property, which will give Energy Fuels the exclusive right to use, license, and service this particular PFN technology globally. PFN is critical to successful uranium production particularly from many ISR deposits, as it more accurately measures downhole in-situ U3O8 ore grade versus traditional Total Gamma and Spectral Gamma methods. The acquisition closed in late July 2020. 
On July 14, 2020, the Company redeemed Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Cdn$20.86 million Convertible Debentures. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding July 14, 2020. On October 6, 2020, the Company redeemed the remaining Cdn$10.43 million principal amount of the Cdn$10.43 million Convertible Debentures outstanding. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable for an amount equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding October 6, 2020. The Convertible Debentures were measured at fair value based on the closing price on the TSX (a Level 1 measurement) and changes were recognized in earnings. As a result of the final redemption, no Convertible Debentures remain outstanding. The Convertible Debentures are no longer subject to the terms of the Indenture, and cease to be listed on the TSX. The Company currently has no other remaining short- or long-term debt.
On August 20, 2020, the Company announced a number of changes to its management team in order to reduce costs, flatten the organizational structure, and focus on the ongoing growth of a new generation of U.S. uranium and RE professionals, including: i) the departure of Paul Goranson as Chief Operating Officer, effective August 31, 2020; ii) the departure of Matthew Tarnowski as Chief Accounting Officer, effective October 31, 2020; iii) the promotion of Scott Bakken to Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, effective September 1, 2020; iv) the promotion of Dee Ann Nazarenus to Vice President, Human Resources and Administration, effective September 1, 2020; and v) the hiring of Sarai Luksch as Controller, effective September 1, 2020. 
On September 21, 2020, the Company announced that it had been advised by the DOE Office of Fossil Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory that Energy Fuels was awarded a contract, working with a team from the Pennsylvania State University (“Penn State”), to evaluate and develop a conceptual design to allow for the commercial production of mixed rare earth oxides from coal-based resources in an environmentally benign fashion. The award includes an option, at the DOE’s election, for Energy Fuels to complete a feasibility study on this initiative.
On November 3, 2020, the Company announced that it had produced at the Company’s White Mesa Mill, using its existing infrastructure and pursuant to its existing Radioactive Materials License and Groundwater Discharge Permit, an REE carbonate concentrate on a pilot scale from a sample of monazite sands from a third-party supplier – the first such initiative in North America in over 20 years. Then, on December 14, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a three-year supply agreement with Chemours to acquire a minimum of 2,500 tons per year of natural monazite sands, which the Company plans to process at the Mill starting in 2021 to recover the contained uranium and produce a marketable mixed REE carbonate, as a key effort toward re-establishing a fully-integrated U.S. REE supply chain (see “ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company’s Rare Earth Elements Business”).
On December 21, 2020, the Company announced the publication of its first Sustainability Report, along with its Climate Change Policy, Human Rights Policy and Vendor Code of Conduct, which together with its other policies describe the Company’s ongoing commitment to the environment, worker health, public safety and social responsibility, including its important role in combating global climate change through producing and recycling carbon-free energy resources.
On December 31, 2020, the Company announced that it filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement to its effective U.S. registration statement on Form S-3 in order to renew its ATM program. Under the renewed ATM program the Company may, at its discretion from time to time, sell up to an additional $35 million of common shares, with sales only being made on the NYSE American at then-prevailing market prices, or any other existing trading market of the common shares in the United States.
Effective March 18, 2021, the Company filed a new base shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC allowing the Company to issue common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, preferred shares, debt securities, or any combination of such securities as units, in amounts, and at prices, and on terms to be determined based on market conditions at the time of sale, and as set forth in an accompanying prospectus supplement, for an aggregate offering amount of up to US$300 million during the 
36-month period that the statement remains effective. On March l6, 2021, the Company received a receipt for a corresponding base shelf prospectus in Canada for an aggregate offering amount in Canada of up to US$300 million.
2021 Corporate Developments
From January 1, 2021 through March 18, 2021, the Company issued 5.50 million Common Shares at an average price of $5.53 for net proceeds of $29.70 million using the ATM.
On March 1, 2021, the Company and Neo Performance Materials (“Neo”) jointly announced that they had entered into an agreement in principle, subject to completion of definitive agreements, under which Energy Fuels will process natural monazite sands into an REE Carbonate beginning in March or April 2021 and ship a portion of that production to Neo's rare earth separations facility in Sillamäe, Estonia ("Silmet"). Neo will then process the REE Carbonate into separated rare earth materials for use in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth-based advanced materials. Silmet is the only operational rare earth separations facility in Europe and has been separating rare earths into commercial value-added products for more than 50 years. Implementation of this initiative is subject to successful ramp-up to commercial-scale operations, execution of definitive agreements, and optimization of the companies' production processes (see “ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company’s Rare Earth Elements Business”).
Company Strategy
Energy Fuels intends to continue to strengthen its position as a leading uranium extraction and recovery company in the United States, supporting that goal through uranium recovery, alternate feed materials processing, third-party processing, and potential land clean-up work. In addition, the Company produces vanadium along with uranium from certain of its properties, as market conditions warrant. The Company also expects to commence commercial production of an REE carbonate in 2021, along with uranium from monazite sands, as well as uranium from alternate feed materials and other ores. See “The Rare Earth Element Market,” below. Through the operating White Mesa Mill, the Nichols Ranch Project and Alta Mesa Project, which are both currently on standby, the Company’s large uranium and vanadium resource base, and existing conventional projects on standby, under construction, and in permitting, the Company’s strategy is to maintain and increase its ability to increase uranium production in improved market conditions.
As a result of the foregoing, we intend to engage in the following activities:
•In response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, the Company intends to evaluate activities aimed towards increasing uranium production at all or some of our production facilities, including the currently operating White Mesa Mill, as well as the Nichols Ranch ISR Facility, Alta Mesa ISR Facility, La Sal Complex, and the Pinyon Plain Mine, all of which are currently on standby, as market conditions may warrant. The Company may commence these activities prior to such establishment, recognizing that there can be no guarantee that the U.S. Uranium Reserve will ever come to fruition or that the implementation details, if they occur, will be satisfactory, and that the outcomes of this process are therefore uncertain.
•Continue to pursue U.S. government support for U.S. uranium production, such as the Company’s recent efforts to help secure a renewal of the Russian Suspension Agreement, including support for the establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and any future recommendations from the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group or other remedies;
•Continue the Company’s ongoing REE initiatives for the production of a REE carbonate concentrate from monazite sands sourced from third-party suppliers, with the potential to enter into one or more joint ventures for the construction of an onsite REE separation facility at the Company’s Mill site and the development of a fully-integrated U.S. REE supply chain (see “ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: The Company’s Rare Earth Elements Business”), above; 
•Defer further wellfield development at Nichols Ranch until uranium prices improve; 
•Continue alternate feed processing, as well as pursue additional alternate feed materials (including potential rare-earth bearing alternate feed materials), third-party processing and other sources of feed for the Mill (including potential material generated from land cleanup work) and, when market conditions warrant, pursue the recovery of uranium and/or vanadium dissolved in the Mill’s pond solutions; 
•Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve and ongoing or new regulatory requirements, continue to carry out engineering, procurement and construction management activities at the Pinyon Plain Project in 2021, and maintain the property on standby until uranium prices improve; 
•Subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, continue to maintain standby projects and facilities (including the Pinyon Plain Project, Alta Mesa Project, the La Sal Project and the Daneros Project) in a state of readiness for the purpose of restarting mining activities, as market conditions may warrant. At this time, subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, all of the Company’s conventional projects are expected to remain on standby until market conditions warrant restarting mining activities, or are in the evaluation or permitting process;
•Continue permitting activities for the Roca Honda Project through the end of 2021;
•Continue to evaluate the sale of non-core assets that the Company does not believe contribute to shareholder value in order to reduce costs and/or receive sales proceeds; and 
•Continue to pursue additional cost cutting measures. 
Uranium Sales
As a result of current uranium market conditions, both ISR and conventional uranium recovery have been maintained at reduced levels until such time as market conditions improve sufficiently, either as a result of any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve or through improved market fundamentals.
The Company has not entered into uranium sales commitments for 2021 as of the date of this Annual Report; therefore, subject to any actions the Company may take in response to the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve or improved market conditions, all 2021 uranium production is expected to be added to existing inventories. Energy Fuels’ significant uranium inventory provides the Company with financial flexibility, and the Company believes its existing inventories and new production may be worth significantly more in the future as a result of government uranium purchases for the proposed Uranium Reserve or otherwise. However, if suitable uranium price increases are observed in 2021, or if cash needs arise, the Company may elect to complete some discretionary uranium sales in 2021.
Overview of Uranium Market
The primary commercial use of uranium is to fuel nuclear power plants for the generation of carbon- and emission-free electricity.
According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), as of January 2021, there were 442 operable nuclear reactors world-wide, which required approximately 177 million pounds of U3O8 fuel at full operation. Worldwide, there are currently 53 new reactors under construction with an additional 98 reactors on order or in the planning stage and 326 which have been proposed.
According to data from TradeTech LLC (“TradeTech”), the world continues to require more uranium than it produces from primary extraction. The gap between demand and primary supply is filled by stockpiled inventories and secondary supplies.
According to the WNA, the United States currently has 94 operating reactors, two reactors under construction, and another 21 reactors on order, planned or proposed. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (“NEI”), in 2019 the United States produced approximately 19.7% of its electricity from nuclear technology, while achieving an average capacity factor of 93%, leading all other carbon-free sources by a wide margin. In addition, in 2019, nuclear energy avoided 476 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), U.S. utilities purchased approximately 48.3 million pounds of U3O8 in 2019. However, through March 31,2020 (the latest data available), the U.S. only produced approximately 8,098 pounds of U3O8; June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 data were withheld due to confidentiality concerns, which the Company believes are the result of low production figures.
Uranium is not traded on an open market or organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange, although the New York Mercantile Exchange provides financially-settled uranium futures contracts. Typically, buyers and sellers negotiate transactions privately and directly. Spot uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur immediately and up to 12 months in the future. Term uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur more than 12 months in the future, with long-term transactions involving delivery terms of at least three years. Uranium prices, both spot and term, are published by two independent market consulting firms, TradeTech and The Ux Consulting Company (“Ux”), on a weekly and monthly basis. Other brokers, including Uranium Markets LLC, Evolution Markets Inc. and Numerco Ltd., also publish daily broker average uranium prices.

The spot and term prices of uranium are influenced by a number of global factors. For example, both the spot and term prices of uranium were negatively impacted by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in March 2011. The events at Fukushima created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear plants and led to both temporary and permanent closures of nuclear plants around the world. The Fukushima incident has created downward pressure on uranium prices over the past nine years, which is still being felt today. In contrast, China is pursuing an aggressive nuclear program, with 49 units now operating, 16 new units under construction, 39 units which are planned, and 168 units that have been proposed, according to January 2021 WNA data.
Historically, most nuclear utilities have sought to purchase a portion of their uranium needs through mid- and long-term supply contracts, while other portions are bought on the spot market. According to EIA data, in 2019, U.S. utilities purchased 22% of their uranium on the spot market with the remaining 78% purchased under mid- and long-term contracts. Buyers seek to balance the security of supply with the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices. For this reason, both buyers and sellers track current spot and term prices for uranium carefully, make considered projections as to future prices, and negotiate with one another on transactions which each deems favorable to their respective interests.
The graph, below, shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from August 1969 until January 2021 (table labeled in 2-year increments, so 2021 does not appear on the axis, though its data is incorporated) as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation):
To give a more recent perspective, the graph below shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from January 2016 until January 2021 as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation):
According to monthly price data from TradeTech, uranium prices during 2020 were up $5.55, or 22% for the year. Monthly spot prices began the year at $24.85 per pound of U3O8 on December 31, 2019 and ended the year at $30.40 per pound, reaching a high of $33.85 per pound for the month of May 2020 and a low of $24.85 per pound at the beginning of the year (as of December 31, 2019). According to Trade Tech, the spot price was $27.40 per pound on March 12, 2021. TradeTech price 
22


data also indicated that long-term U3O8 prices began 2019 at $33.00 per pound and ended 2020 at $37.00 per pound. The high long-term price for 2020 was $39.00 per pound for the months of May and June, and the low long-term price was $33.00 per pound for the months of January and February. The long-term price at March 12, 2021 was $35.00 per pound. The Company believes the weak uranium markets are the result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of state-owned uranium extraction in Kazakhstan and elsewhere, secondary uranium extraction and excess inventories, the availability of low-priced spot material, excess enrichment causing underfeeding and tails re-enrichment, insufficient production cut-backs especially from state-owned and state-subsidized uranium and uranium fuel entities, premature reactor closures, and continued weak uranium demand.
Uranium Market Outlook and Uranium Marketing Strategy
World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable baseload electricity is growing. As a result of the expected growth of nuclear energy and the depletion of existing uranium mines, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals of the uranium industry remain positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to support the new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand we expect to see as more nuclear units are constructed around the world, and as primary mine production drops due to depletion of resources, low prices, and temporary shutdowns caused by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements continue to exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. In addition, it is the Company's belief that additional mine production cutbacks will be required to bring the market into balance in the short and medium terms. However, a large portion of global uranium production is state-owned and state-subsidized, and therefore not subject to normal market fundamentals. It is for this reason that the Company supports the creation of the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve to ensure the U.S. has sufficient uranium mining capacity to meet national security and energy security needs. The Company estimates that, for 2020, well less than 1% of U.S. reactor demand was met by new production from U.S. uranium mines. The Company has believed for several years that market forces will cause uranium prices, and long-term contracting levels in particular, to return to levels that are sufficient to incentivize new mine production. However, it is the Company’s belief that secondary supplies, inventories, and non-free market forces have delayed this recovery.
The Company believes prices likely hit a bottom in 2016, and despite continued market uncertainty in 2020, the lows of 2016 have not been repeated since. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused uranium prices to rise significantly as several large mines temporarily ceased operations, including Cameco Corporation's Cigar Lake and mines in Kazakhstan. Uranium spot prices began the year at $24.85 per pound, and prices were relatively flat for the first two months of the year with the price on February 29, 2020 having risen $0.05 to $24.90 per pound (TradeTech, The Nuclear Review, December 2020). By March, the COVID-19 pandemic caused “widespread security of supply concerns … as several producers took preventative action to forestall the spread of the novel coronavirus through their businesses,” including Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan), Cameco (Canada), and China National Nuclear Corporation (Namibia). By April 30, 2020, the spot price had risen over 35% versus February levels to $33.75 per pound (Ibid). According to TradeTech, “the trajectory had its roots in a supply and demand picture that saw existing and emerging annual production levels decline well below reactor requirements” (Ibid). By May and into the second and third quarters, the spot price volatility subsided, and the monthly spot price of uranium sat at $29.90 per pound at the end of October 2020 (TradeTech, NMR, October 31, 2020). According to TradeTech, 2020 spot volumes reached near-record levels, totaling almost 62.5 million pounds of uranium. In other developments, U.S. uranium production dropped a further 76% to only 190,000 pounds in 2019 versus 2018 and BHP abandoned Olympic Dam expansion plans (TradeTech, The Nuclear Review, December 2020). In addition, Rio Tinto ceased production at its Ranger mine in early January 2021 (Mining.com, Australia’s Ranger uranium mine ceased production, January 7, 2020). On the policy front, the U.S. Congress funded $75 million for fiscal year 2021 for the establishment of a national uranium reserve, which was signed into law by the President in late-December (TradeTech, The Nuclear Review, December 2020). In addition, the U.S. and Russia agreed to extend the Russian Suspension Agreement which limits the amount of Russian uranium that can enter the U.S. (Ibid).
The Company believes that certain uranium supply and demand fundamentals are pointing to higher prices in the future, including significant production cuts and increased demand from utilities, financial entities, traders, and producers. However, the Company also believes that while uranium market conditions have improved in 2020, they still remain weak primarily as a result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium supplies, excess inventories, and thus far insufficient primary production cut-backs, particularly from state-owned enterprises. 
In the short- and medium-terms, market challenges remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, and there remains a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently expected ranges.
23


The Company’s marketing strategy is to seek a base of earnings and cash flow through sales of a portion of its uranium into term contracts, to the extent such contracts are available at satisfactory prices, which has not been the case in recent years. To gain exposure to increasing uranium prices, the Company seeks to sell a portion of its planned uranium extraction into contracts with market-related formulas, if available at satisfactory prices, and through future spot and term sales. Further exposure to increasing uranium prices can be generated through the Company’s ability to bring additional uranium extraction online in the future in response to increasing prices, which can be sold on a market-related or fixed basis at then prevailing prices.
During 2020, the Company did not complete any material uranium sales. It has maintained its uranium inventory for future sales, in anticipation of higher uranium prices in the future, either as a result of U.S. government purchases for the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve or due to improved market fundamentals.
The Company completed the remaining uranium deliveries under all its long-term contracts in 2018. Therefore, all of the Company’s current uranium production and inventory is 100% unhedged, and all uranium sales in 2021 and beyond will be made on the spot market or pursuant to new long-term contracts to the extent such contracts may be available on satisfactory terms. While the Company does not currently forecast the need to complete any spot sales in 2021 for cash generation purposes, uranium inventories, along with expected uranium production in 2021, are expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to complete spot sales in 2021 in response to the proposed establishment of a U.S. Uranium Reserve, or otherwise if market conditions warrant.
The Rare Earth Element Market
In 2020, the Company began evaluating the potential to process REEs at the White Mesa Mill. By October, the Company had produced a mixed REE carbonate, ready for separation, on a pilot scale from natural monazite ore. In December 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Chemours to acquire a minimum quantity of 2,500 tons of natural monazite ore per year for three years starting in 2021. The Company is currently evaluating selling all or a portion of the resulting carbonate to a buyer in Europe and/or stockpiling it for future separation at the Mill.
REEs are used in a variety of clean energy and advanced technologies. According to Roskill, most demand for REE’s is in the form of separated REEs, “as most end-use applications require only one or two separated rare earth compounds or products.” (Roskill, Rare Earths, Outlook to 2030, 20th Edition). The REE market is dominated by China, and according to 2018 data, controlled 68% of global primary production, 100% of global secondary production, and nearly all production of the “heavy” REEs, including terbium and dysprosium (Adames Intelligence). 
The main uses for REEs include: (i) battery alloys; (ii) catalysts; (iii) ceramics, pigments and glazes; (iv) glass polishing powders and additives; (v) metallurgy and alloys; (vi) permanent magnets; (vii) phosphors; and (viii) others (Adames Intelligence). By volume, REEs permanent magnets (neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), dysprosium (Dy), and terbium (Tb)) and catalysts (cerium (Ce) and lanthanum (La) comprised 60% of total consumption, but over 90% of the value consumed. 
REEs are comprised of 15 chemical elements, plus scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y). Plus, each individual REE may transact in a number of forms. Therefore, there is no single price for REEs, but numerous prices for individual REE oxides and compounds. The primary value that the Company expects to generate in the short- to medium-term will come from NdPr, Ce, and La. According to data from Asian Metal, NdPr oxide mid-point prices in China rose approximately 45% during 2020 from 282,500 RMB per metric tonne to 411,500 RMB per metric tonne. Ce oxide prices in Europe dropped 9% from $2.30/kg to $2.10/kg. La oxide prices in China dropped 18% from $1,830 per metric tonne to $1,495 per metric tonne.
As demand for clean energy technologies, including electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and batteries, along with other advanced technologies, increases in the coming years, the Company expects demand and prices for REEs, particularly the ones mentioned above, to increase. Expected increases in supply sources for REEs are also expected to increase with expected rising REE prices, which is expected to have a moderating impact on price increases. 
The Vanadium Market 
The White Mesa Mill has historically recovered vanadium along with uranium from certain of its properties on the Colorado Plateau, including from the La Sal Project and Rim Mine, as well as from properties owned by third-parties on the Colorado Plateau through toll milling and similar arrangements, when the price of vanadium has been high enough to justify its recovery.
In December 2018, the Company commenced a campaign to recover V2O5 from existing tailings pond solutions at the Company’s White Mesa Mill, which resulted from past mineral processing operations. In early January 2019, the Company produced its first batches of vanadium concentrate, also known as “black flake.” This was Energy Fuels’ first vanadium 
24


production since 2013, and the first time the Company recovered vanadium from tailings pond solutions at the Mill. The Company produced vanadium through the end of 2019, recovering approximately 1.8 million pounds of high-quality V2O5 under this campaign, at which point production ceased due to weak vanadium market conditions. The Company did not sell material quantities of vanadium during 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, the Company holds approximately 1,672,000 pounds of vanadium in inventory.
Vanadium is a metallic element that, when converted into ferrovanadium (“FeV”) (an alloy of vanadium and iron), is used primarily as an additive to strengthen and harden steel. According to market consultant Roskill, over 90% of FeV is used in the steel industry. In addition, vanadium is used in the aerospace and chemical industries, and continues to see interest in energy storage technologies, including vanadium redox flow batteries. China is the largest global producer of vanadium, with additional production coming from Russia, South Africa, and Brazil (Roskill). Following a dramatic spike in prices in 2018, vanadium (as V2O5) prices were down sharply in 2019, with mid-point spot prices in Europe beginning the year at $15.50 per pound, and ending the year at $5.33 per pound, reaching a high of $17.38 per pound in February 2018 (Metal Bulletin) and a low of $4.73 per pound in October 2019. During 2020, vanadium prices rose slightly to $5.40 by the end of the year. The high spot price for the year was $7.13 per pound on February 14, 2020, and the low price for vanadium in 2020 was $5.10 per pound on November 6, 2020. As at March 12, 2021, Vanadium prices were $8.33 per pound.
According to Metal Bulletin, vanadium prices rose dramatically in the second half of 2018 due to anticipated increased demand in China which implemented new standards requiring increased quantities of vanadium in rebar. However, in late-2018, prices began to drop sharply “when market participants realized the enforcement of the revised rebar policy was not as stringent as had been expected and after steel mills increased their use of ferro-niobium to reduce consumption of more costly vanadium.” (Metal Bulletin, January 20, 2020). According to Roskill, 2020 was “characterized by an economic de-synchronisation between China and the rest of the world, with a wide divergence in terms of steel consumption and production.” (Roskill, Vanadium, niobium: Markets in 2020 – a China story, December 22, 2020). China’s steel production reached an all-time high due to stimulus and infrastructure spending, while the rest of the world suffered under COVID lockdowns (Ibid). Vanadium prices were supported in China due to “reverse substitution away from niobium.” (Ibid). Further Roskill projects tighter supply and higher demand for vanadium in 2021 and into 2022 as lockdowns are relaxed and vaccines become more widely distributed (Ibid).
During January 2020, Energy Fuels produced approximately 67,000 pounds of vanadium, as production was wound down from 2019. The Company did not sell any quantities of vanadium in 2020. The Company held approximately 1,672,000 pounds of vanadium in inventory at the end of 2020. Vanadium markets can be volatile; therefore, the Company expects to hold and sell this inventory into stronger markets in the future, or as cash requirements arise. 
Competition
The uranium industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with mining and exploration companies for uranium sales, the acquisition of uranium mineral properties, and the procurement of equipment, materials and personnel necessary to explore, develop, and extract uranium from such properties. There is competition for a limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities, including competition with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than the Company. As a result, the Company may encounter challenges in acquiring attractive properties, and exploring and advancing properties currently in the Company’s portfolio. In addition, Energy Fuels competes with other uranium recovery companies, along with traders, brokers, financial institutions, converters, enrichers, and other market actors, including some that are state-owned and state-subsidized, for uranium sales. Due to the Company’s limited capital and personnel and the relative size of its operations, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to some other companies with regards to exploration and, if warranted, development of mining properties and securing uranium sales. The Company believes that competition for acquiring mineral prospects and completing uranium sales will continue to be intense in the future.
The availability of funds for exploration, evaluation, permitting and construction of uranium projects is limited, and the Company may find it difficult to compete on an international scale with larger and more established uranium exploration and production companies for capital. The Company’s inability to continue exploration, advancement, and the acquisition of new properties due to lack of funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operations and financial position.
However, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage over its peers in the U.S. domestic uranium space to the extent it has diversified business opportunities, including its ability to produce vanadium as market conditions may warrant, its ability to recycle uranium through its alternate feed materials processing business, and its ability to recover REE carbonate, along with uranium, from monazite sand ores.
Government Regulation
The Company’s properties and facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations which are overseen and enforced by multiple federal, state and local authorities. These laws govern exploration, construction, extraction, recovery, processing, exports, various taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, toxic and hazardous substances, and other matters. Uranium minerals exploration, extraction, recovery, and processing are also subject to risks and liabilities associated with the perceived potential for impacts to the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of such activities.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and will subject the Company to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these regulations could require the Company to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations. However, compliance with government regulations generally, including but not limited to environmental regulations, is an integral part of the Company’s day-to-day business and impacts virtually all of the Company’s capital expenditure and operating decisions at its facilities, as the Company’s facilities and operations must comply with this extensive array of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are therefore well understood and assumed by the Company in all of its capital budgeting decisions, project analyses and cost and earnings projections. As all of the Company’s competitors in the uranium mining industry in the U.S. face the same or similar regulatory requirements, the Company does not believe its need to comply with this extensive array of laws and regulations materially affects the Company’s competitive position within the U.S. uranium mining industry.
Environmental Regulations
Exploration, development, and extraction activities are subject to environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the continuance of our activities. In general, our exploration, evaluation, and extraction activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. Specifically, we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment, water discharges, and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. In addition, legislation has been enacted which requires facility sites to be reclaimed in accordance with such legislation. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date.
Uranium milling in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”) pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Its primary function is to ensure the protection of employees, the public, and the environment from radioactive materials, and it also regulates most aspects of the uranium recovery process. The NRC regulations pertaining to uranium recovery facilities are codified in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for the White Mesa Mill is now the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) rather than the NRC. At that time, the Mill’s NRC Source Material License was transferred to the State of Utah and became a Radioactive Materials License (the “Radioactive Materials License”), which was renewed in January 2018 as Amendment #8 (Renewal), then reissued as a Revised Renewal on February 16, 2018, by UDEQ’s Division of Waste Management and Radiation Control (“DWMRC”). On April 15, 2020, the DWMRC reissued the License as Amendment #9 with an amended Condition 9.7, which was revised for the purpose of incorporating into the Radioactive Materials License applicable State of Utah requirements relating to antiquities, historic site and Native American grave protections and repatriation, as these requirements had previously been expressed in terms of equivalent provisions of federal law. Two alternate feed Applications for Amendment are currently pending approval by the DWMRC. The State of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations or by reference, all aspects of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery facilities. When the State of Utah became an Agreement State, it required that a Groundwater Discharge Permit (“GWDP”) be put in place for the White Mesa Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of Utah, and specifically tailors the implementation of the state groundwater regulations to the Mill site. The State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have a GWDP, regardless of whether the facility discharges to groundwater. The GWDP for the Mill was finalized and implemented in March 2005, then renewed in January 2018 and modified as of March 8, 2021. The White Mesa Mill also maintains a permit approval for air emissions with the UDEQ, Division of Air Quality.
Conventional uranium extraction is subject to regulation by a number of agencies including: (1) local county and municipal government agencies; (2) the applicable state divisions responsible for mining and protecting the environment within Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming; (3) the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) and the United States Forest Service (the “USFS”) on public lands under their jurisdiction; (4) the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”); (5) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) for radon emissions from underground mines; and (6) other federal agencies, including without limitation the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFW”), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”), and United States Department of Energy (“DOE”), where certain conditions exist. In addition, a uranium processing facility at the Sheep Mountain Project, if and when constructed, will be subject to regulation under the NRC, as a uranium processing facility and for permanent disposal of the resulting tailings.
The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and its regulations that are applicable to uranium milling also apply to our ISR facilities in Wyoming and Texas. The Nichols Ranch Project and the Alta Mesa Project each have a Source Material License. The Nichols Ranch Source Material License was originally issued by the NRC; however, the State of Wyoming became an NRC Agreement State on September 30, 2018 and the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) - Land Quality Division (“WDEQ-LQD”) subsequently assumed all management and oversight functions. Texas, an NRC Agreement State since 1963, issued the Alta Mesa Source Material License through its Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”). ISR facilities are also regulated by the State of Wyoming and State of Texas, respectively, and the EPA under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, ISR wellfields require an Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act, as administered by the EPA. ISR operations are subject to regulations by the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), rather than MSHA.
Reclamation bonds or the equivalent have been posted for each of the Company’s material properties that have structures or facilities. Energy Fuels is required to have export licenses issued by the NRC for its uranium exports, unless otherwise permissible pursuant to the White Mesa Mill’s existing Radioactive Materials License due to the nature of the material in question. Such licenses are obtained by the Company as required.
Land Tenure
The Company’s land holdings are held either by leases from the fee simple owners (private parties or the State) or unpatented mining claims located on property owned and managed by the U.S. Federal Government. Annual fees must be paid to maintain unpatented mining claims, but work expenditures are not required. Holders of unpatented mining claims are generally granted surface access to conduct mineral exploration and extraction activities. However, additional permits and plans are generally required prior to conducting exploration or mining activities on such claims.
On July 9, 2009, BLM issued a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal (“2009 Notice”) under which it proposed that a total of approximately one million acres of public lands around the Grand Canyon National Park be withdrawn from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 (the “Mining Law”), subject to valid existing rights. In the 2009 Notice, BLM stated that the purpose of the withdrawal, if determined to be appropriate, would be to protect the Grand Canyon watershed from any adverse effects of locatable hardrock mineral exploration and mining. The 2009 Notice segregated the lands from location and entry under the mining laws for up to two years to allow time for various studies and analyses, including appropriate NEPA analysis. In order to allow more time for BLM to complete its NEPA analysis, the U.S. Department of the Interior (the “DOI”) published Public Land Order 7773 on June 21, 2011, which effected a six-month emergency withdrawal of the area. The emergency withdrawal prevented the lands from being open to location and entry under the Mining Law upon expiration of the two-year segregation while the DOI completed the decision–making process on the proposed withdrawal. The emergency withdrawal was effective from July 21, 2011 to January 20, 2012. During the two-year segregation and six-month emergency withdrawal, the BLM, along with its cooperating agencies, completed various studies and analyses of resources in the withdrawal area, including an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). These studies and analyses were undertaken to provide the basis for the final decision regarding whether to proceed with the proposed withdrawal or to select an alternative action. Based on this analysis, on January 9, 2012, the DOI announced its final decision to withdraw from location and entry under the Mining Law, subject to valid existing rights, the total of approximately one million acres of lands originally proposed in the 2009 Notice (the “Withdrawn Lands”), for a 20-year period. Lawsuits challenging this decision were filed by various industry groups and interested parties. In addition, legislation has been proposed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, which would make the withdrawal permanent, subject to preexisting rights. The Company will track the progress of this legislation. 
As a result of the 2009 withdrawal from location and entry, no new mining claims may be staked on the Withdrawn Lands and no new Plans of Operations may be approved, other than Plans of Operations on mining claims that were valid at the time of withdrawal and that remain valid at the time of plan approval. Case law indicates that a miner establishes valid Congressionally provided rights under the Mining Law through certain unilateral acts, and that such acts are presumptively recognized as valid claims in which the holder has valid existing rights unless and until the DOI or U.S. Federal Courts declare otherwise. 
However, the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) and USFS, each at their discretion, may perform a mineral examination and Mineral Report, which involves an economic evaluation of a project, in order to reflect an agency’s belief about certain mining claims that may be used in support of a future mining claim contest on the validity of existing rights. All the Company’s properties located on the Arizona Strip, with the exception of its Wate property and certain exploration properties held by the Company’s subsidiary, Arizona Strip Partners LLC, are located within the Withdrawn Lands. A mineral examination on the Company’s EZ Project will need to be completed by BLM, in conjunction with its review of the Company’s proposed Plan of Operations for that project. Mineral examinations were not required for the Company’s Arizona 1 and Pinenut projects, which had previously approved Plans of Operations and were previously active. Although the Company’s Pinyon Plain Project also has an approved Plan of Operations, and a mineral examination is not required, the USFS voluntarily performed a mineral examination on that Project in 2012 in order to clarify the agency’s own position on the underlying claims and concluded that the Pinyon Plain Project’s claims constituted valid existing rights (“VERs”). The USFS also concluded that no additional approvals were required on the Pinyon Plain Project that would trigger any further NEPA analysis as a major federal action.
The Company believes that all its material projects within the Withdrawn Lands are on valid mining claims that will each withstand a mineral examination. However, market conditions may postpone or prevent the performance of mineral examinations on certain properties and, if a mineral examination is performed on a property, there can be no guarantee that the mineral examination would not result in one of more of the Company’s mining claims being deemed invalid and/or that ongoing litigation challenging the validity of a VER determination would not result in the overturn of such determination, either of which could prevent a project from proceeding.
Former President Obama additionally designated the Bears Ears National Monument by executive order in December of 2016, which comprised 1.35 million acres of land in San Juan County, Utah. The designated land included a portion of County Road 258, which the Company relies on for access to its Daneros Project, and a property boundary that abutted the boundary of the White Mesa Mill and encompassed two water sampling sites the Company monitors for the Mill. In December 2017, former President Trump issued a Proclamation that amended former President Obama’s 2016 Proclamation and reduced the monument to two parcels encompassing a total of 201,876 acres, releasing 1.15 million acres. That Proclamation has been challenged in Federal Court. The closest boundaries of the reduced monument to any of the Company’s operations are approximately 6 miles from the White Mesa Mill and approximately 15 miles from the Daneros Project. On December 23, 2017, the Company issued a press release reiterating its past and present support of Bears Ears National Monument, and clarifying that the Company sought only minor adjustments to the original boundaries of the monument to prevent the boundary from directly abutting some of its existing operations, which were very minor adjustments, insignificant compared to the original size of the monument, and not a reflection of now former President Trump’s total reduction. However, it is possible that the Daneros Project and/or the White Mesa Mill could become subject to additional requirements, restrictions and costs if the original designation is upheld in Court, or reinstated by President Biden.
Employees
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 94 full-time employees, all of whom are employed through the Company’s wholly owned, indirectly held subsidiary Energy Fuels Resources (USA) Inc. We operate in established mining areas where we have found sufficient available personnel for our business plans.
The Company is dependent on key personnel and qualified and experienced employees to conduct its business, given its diversified business opportunities, including its ability to produce vanadium as market conditions may warrant, its ability to recycle uranium through its alternate feed materials processing business, and its ability to recover REE carbonate, along with uranium, from monazite sand ores, all of which businesses are currently unique to the Company among its peers. The Company’s compensation plans, including its Omnibus Equity Incentive Compensation Plan are designed to address the attraction and retention of personnel, through the grant of equity incentives, in addition to cash salaries. This allows the Company to provide attractive incentive packages to its employees, while at the same time preserving its cash resources during times of low commodity prices and standby operations at a number of its facilities. Further, under these plans, all equity compensation granted to employees vests over time, thereby providing a retention incentive for key employees. The Company also has a succession plan designed to identify and address gaps and risks associated with succession of key employees. In addition, as part of the Company’s ongoing efforts to develop and retain key employees, on August 20, 2020, the Company announced a number of changes to its management team in order to reduce costs, flatten the organizational structure, and focus on the ongoing growth of a new generation of U.S. uranium and REE professionals (See “2020 Corporate Developments”).
