--------+----------

Overview
In this Annual Report, references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Pegasus Digital Mobility Acquisition Corp. References to our “management” or our “management team” refer to our officers. References to the sponsor refer to Pegasus Digital Mobility Sponsor LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company.
The Company is a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated on March 30, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “business combination”). The Company has not selected any specific business combination target. Until the Company completes its initial business combination, the Company will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues.
On October 26, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 20,000,000 units of the Company (the “units”). The Company also granted the underwriters of the initial public offering (the “underwriters”) a 45-day over-allotment option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional units at the initial public offering price (the “Over-Allotment Option”). Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (a “Class A ordinary share”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $200,000,000.
Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, the sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B ordinary shares” or “founder shares”). The founder shares included an aggregate of up to 750,000 shares subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ Over-Allotment Option was exercised so that the number of founder shares would collectively represent approximately 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the initial public offering. On November 8, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the Over-Allotment Option, and, as a result of such partial exercise and the expiration of the Over-Allotment Option, 125,000 of the 5,750,000 founder shares were forfeited by the sponsor.
Upon the closing of the initial public offering, the anchor investors (as defined herein) purchased 1,375,000 founder shares from the sponsor.
The sponsor and its permitted transferees and the anchor investors (collectively, the “initial shareholders”) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Class B ordinary shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial business combination; and (B) subsequent to the initial business combination (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial business combination or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the public shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Any permitted transferees would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial shareholders with respect to any Class B ordinary shares.
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company completed the private sale of 9,000,000 warrants (the “initial private placement warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant, to the sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $9,000,000.
As noted above, on November 8, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the Over-Allotment Option and purchased an additional 2,500,000 units from the Company (the “over-allotment units”). The issuance by the Company of the over-allotment units at a price of $10.00 per unit generated gross proceeds to the Company of $25,000,000. On November 8, 2021, simultaneously with the sale and issuance of the over-allotment units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 750,000 private placement warrants (together with the initial private placement warrants, the “private placement warrants”) to the sponsor, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $750,000.

The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in the initial public offering, except that so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees: (1) they will not be redeemable by the Company (except in certain redemption scenarios when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00 (as adjusted)); (2) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the sponsor until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination; (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) are entitled to registration rights. The private placement warrants have been issued pursuant to, and are governed by, the warrant agreement. The private placement warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $7,875,000 in underwriting commissions payable upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination) and $1,640,821 in offering costs including directors and officers insurance premiums of $891,167 relating to the initial public offering, a total of $227,250,000 of net proceeds from the initial public offering and the sales of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of an initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 15 months (which is extendable to up to six months) from the closing of the initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Class A ordinary shares; and (3) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the Company has not completed an initial business combination within 15 months (which is extendable to up to six months) from the closing of the initial public offering, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company’s public shareholders. As of December 31, 2021, there was $227,262,051 in investments and cash held in the trust account and $1,031,397 of cash held outside the trust account available for working capital.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 30, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 relates to the Company’s initial public offering, which is described above, and identifying a target company for a business combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues unless and until completion of a business combination, at the earliest.
Business Strategy
We are focused on consummating our initial business combination with a target within the broadly defined next-generation transportation sector. We believe this business sector is in the early stages of a generational growth trend that is accelerating as a result of energy transformation through the rise of zero emission transportation, as well as the digitization of mobility through artificial intelligence, wireless connectivity and software applications. We include both battery electric as well as hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles as the main modes of zero emission vehicles (“ZEVs”) or electric vehicles (“EVs”), and we define transportation as both the mobility of people and the transportation of goods. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any stage of its corporate evolution, in any industry and in any geographical location, we intend to focus within our core target sector, as well as within strategically adjacent technologies, applications and services, particularly in the European market. We intend to focus in the European market given our management team’s experience in global markets, including in the European market, which we believe is currently attractive, expansive and underserved and should present abundant potential business combination targets that satisfy our acquisition criteria.
Our investment thesis is underpinned by the electrification of the transportation system and centered around subsectors where we can leverage the domain expertise of our management team, including in the following subsectors of the next-generation transportation sector:
● ZEV Original Equipment Manufacturing. The ZEV original equipment manufacturing subsector includes ZEV manufacturing for commercial, consumer, transportation, logistics and first response vehicles as well as the associated vehicle design technology, ZEV design, engineering, research and development;

5



● ZEV Infrastructure and Platforms. The ZEV infrastructure and platforms subsector encompasses smart grids, charging technologies, charging stations, fuel cell production, hydrogen refueling infrastructure, fleet management, battery factories and technology applications;
● ZEV Powertrain and related fields.  The ZEV powertrain subsector contains energy storage and battery management system, Electric Drive Units, Power Electronics and Charging System, as well as related areas like range extenders, stationary energy storage technologies with battery second life applications and green and blue hydrogen production and storage processes and applications; and
● Technology Improving Transportation Connectivity.  The connected transportation subsector includes vehicle connectivity applications, telematics and fleet management, smart traffic technology, mapping technology and autonomous applications.
We believe we are in the early stages of a global industrial revolution as it relates to our ability to sustainably power our energy needs through renewable sources, which requires us to also pursue decarbonization and energy efficiency initiatives in tandem, and our investment focus is also underpinned by a stringent commitment to world-class environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) and corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) practices.
We believe that our management team’s domain expertise, operational skillsets, network of relationships and insights into accelerating technology trends in the transportation sector will be a competitive advantage as we seek to identify and pursue opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and offer public market investors access and direct investment exposure to these trends.
In particular, we intend to leverage the extensive networks of our management team throughout our comprehensive selection process and we believe that our collective relationships and domain expertise will facilitate the origination of proprietary business combination opportunities, particularly in the European market. We believe we are well-positioned to attract high-quality targets in light of our management team’s collective transportation and digital mobility sector experience, and the investment success, growth strategy implementation and operational enhancement skillsets of our sponsor, management team and board of directors. Furthermore, we believe that our management team’s decades of experience working together and pioneering innovative technologies, systems and processes in the European transportation sector, in addition to their extensive global expertise, provides a distinctive value proposition to the management teams, customers, and owners of the prospective target companies.
Further, we believe the expertise and experience of Strategic Capital Fund Management, LLC (“Strategic Capital”), the founder of our sponsor, in identifying and underwriting management teams with value creation investment strategies, as well as in establishing entrepreneurial platforms, providing access to capital for growth initiatives and structuring complex transactions, will make us a preferred partner for potential business combination targets. Strategic Capital is led by industry veterans with decades of experience working together to convert innovative strategies into value creation, with a key focus on next-generation technologies and sustainability-linked strategies.
Since its inception in 2009, Strategic Capital and its affiliates, have successfully worked to build nine companies by assembling experienced management teams that function across a variety of sectors, including digital connectivity infrastructure, renewable energy, social impact, healthcare, credit and commercial real estate, as well as in capital raising for investment vehicles. These companies have benefited from the equity support of more than $4.5 billion in equity capital that has been raised and/or deployed by Strategic Capital and its affiliated entities.
Strategic Capital has a proven track record supporting the increased need for robust digital connectivity infrastructure given substantial data proliferation trends, which is a key factor supporting our business strategy and our selection of next-generation transportation as our target sector. Strategic Capital has identified growing connectivity trends across people, vehicles, devices and applications to enable innovative technologies, such as vehicular autonomy, artificial intelligence, robotics, space exploration, quantum computing, virtual reality, machine learning, and blockchain.
We believe the growing global adoption of 5G wireless technology will continue to accelerate these connectivity trends, which are expected to have a profound impact on the transportation sector through next-generation technologies such as autonomous vehicles, remote sensing, electric vertical takeoff and landing (“eVTOL”), smart cities and intelligent public transportation systems. We also believe that as cities continue to become more densely populated, enhancing urban connectivity in both public and private

transportation systems around the world will be a necessity to overcome traffic congestion problems over the next century. Additionally, we believe we are in early stages of a global industrial revolution in transportation systems. We believe there is a critical need for zero emission transportation by sustainably powering our energy consumption through renewable sources, which will be supported by significant investments in decarbonization, electrification and other energy efficiency initiatives.
Select examples of investment strategies that we believe highlight Strategic Capital’s value creation supporting entities that have digital connectivity infrastructure and sustainability-linked strategies include:
● Digital Connectivity Infrastructure. Strategic Capital and its affiliates sponsor and raise capital for various private retail and institutional investment programs focused in the data center, wireless tower and connectivity sectors. Strategic Capital and its affiliates first became involved in the digital connectivity infrastructure sector over a decade ago through their prior business relationship with Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc. (“CVREIT”), a publicly registered non-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 2009 for the purpose of acquiring a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate with a focus on data centers and healthcare properties, and Sila Realty Trust, Inc. (f/k/a Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc.) (“Sila”), a publicly registered non-traded REIT formed in 2013 with the same investment focus as CVREIT. Sila acquired CVREIT in 2019 through a merger transaction whereby CVREIT merged with and into Sila, with a combined company value of approximately $3.2 billion. Prior to the merger with Sila in 2019, CVREIT monetized a data center portfolio in 2017 and 2018 resulting in approximately $1.3 billion in net proceeds. In September 2020, Sila internalized its external advisor functions, at which time Strategic Capital’s and its affiliates’ relationship with Sila ended. Prior to September 2020, Strategic Capital and/or its affiliates held an equity interest in the external advisor responsible for Sila’s (and CVREIT’s) day-to-day operations and acted as the wholesale dealer manager of Sila’s (and CVREIT’s) public offerings, which raised approximately $3.0 billion in the aggregate that was used to fund data center and healthcare real estate investment activities. Strategic Capital is currently active in the sector through the sponsorship of Strategic Data Center Fund, LLC (“Strategic Data Center”), Strategic Wireless Infrastructure Fund, LLC (“Strategic Wireless”), Strategic Wireless Infrastructure Fund II, Inc. (“Strategic Wireless II”), and Strategic Data Center Institutional Manager, LLC (“Datasphere”).
● Sustainability Linked Strategies. Strategic Capital and its affiliates have experience with both environmental and social sustainability linked strategies, which include supporting renewable energy projects, Small and Medium Enterprises (“SMEs”) in developing economies and middle-market companies in the U.S. In particular, Strategic Capital was an equity partner through 2019 and served as the wholesale dealer manager for Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company LLC (“Greenbacker”), which is a publicly registered non-traded energy company founded in 2012. Greenbacker’s portfolio currently is comprised of approximately 337 renewable energy assets, 22.22 GW of system capacity and approximately $1.74 billion of gross investment value, as of September 30, 2021.
Our Management Team
Our management team is comprised of industry leaders with highly complementary backgrounds. We believe that the experience of our management team will allow us to source, identify and execute an attractive transaction for both our investors and potential business combination opportunities. Our management team (in addition to our directors discussed below) includes Sir Dr. Ralf Speth, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, F. Jeremey Mistry, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Dr. Stefan Berger, our Chief Investment Officer. Our management team has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the broader transportation industry and more than a decade of experience collaborating across various institutions, transactions and initiatives, as highlighted below. We believe these are complementary skillsets that will allow for a seamless transition and a successful outcome towards our goal of identifying, executing and optimizing a potential business combination. We also believe our management team has complementary skills and experience relevant to our target market, including an understanding of the auto industry’s infrastructure and how new technologies can be seamlessly integrated in order to allow for rapid expansion.
Our management team has experience in:
● Identifying, sourcing, structuring, acquiring, financing and monetizing transportation businesses;
● Operating both large established and emerging companies as senior executives and active board members, and setting clear and effective business strategies for companies in the transportation sector;

7



● Collaborating across various institutions, transactions and initiatives for longer than a decade;
● Launching entrepreneurial ventures, products and services and growing them over time into independent businesses or business lines within large institutions;
● Utilizing best practices from mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and financial management; experiences to implement prudent strategic growth initiatives both organically and inorganically; and
● Executing operational value enhancements and efficiency initiatives.
Market Opportunity
We intend to focus on consummating an initial business combination with a company operating in the next-generation transportation sector through ZEVs, but may opportunistically pursue companies in the strategic adjacencies of associated technologies and services in attractive and expansive global markets. We include both battery electric as well as hydrogen fuel cell EVs as main modes of ZEVs or EVs and transportation includes both mobility of people and transportation of goods. We believe the market opportunity is both large and diverse with critical secular tailwinds stimulating growth, particularly in the European market. According to Research and Markets, the overall global transportation industry, which includes ground, transit, air, truck, rail, water, pipeline, storage and general modes of transportation, is expected to grow to a total market size of approximately $7.5 trillion by 2023, with Western Europe comprising approximately 30% of the total market. We perceive two prevailing trends in the next generation transportation sector, (i) a move to ZEVs and (ii) enhanced and optimized transportation connectivity, and intend to focus on these areas. The European market represents the second largest market for EVs in the world today and benefits from governmental mandates that promote ZEV adoption and the transition away from pollutant internal combustion engine (“ICE”) forms of traditional transportation. Furthermore, we expect continued momentum in the connected transportation space as so-called smart cars improve safety and reduce congestion.
According to a research study published by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., an estimated $6 trillion of global spending is required to update existing infrastructure to comply with legislative restrictions on ICE vehicle production and to build a network of supporting systems for ZEVs such as charging stations, smart grids and green and blue hydrogen production systems. As part of this transition, we expect rapid penetration of ZEVs and associated technologies in the mobility space. Over the next 5 years, RBC Capital Markets forecasts approximately 11% Battery Electric Vehicle global penetration of new demand representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 40% from 2020 levels and approximately 5% Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle penetration representing a CAGR of approximately 35%. McKinsey estimates that hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles could constitute up to 20% of the total vehicle fleet by 2050 with an even larger role of up to 30% in heavier and long-range segments.
The International Council on Clean Transportation reports 17 governments across the world (and 11 governments in Europe) that have announced bans on ICE sales. With mounting pressure for others to follow suit, we believe the inevitability and longevity of the advanced mobility sector are unquestionable. Leveraging decades of experience in the automotive and zero emissions mobility sectors, our management team is positioned to capitalize on these strong tailwinds and sustained growth trends, which are having a significant impact throughout the world and should present substantial opportunities on a global basis.
The IOT Solutions World Congress reports that “connected vehicle platforms, advanced traffic analysis and private and indoor mapping are making their way into the industry” by offering improved safety. Beyond safety, connected vehicles offer further benefits including reduced congestion and heightened efficiency. We believe that the connected transportation trend is underpinned by established momentum and strong tailwinds supporting growth.
Furthermore, we believe that the next-generation transportation landscape in the EU is adapting and converting at a higher velocity than in recent years, which is creating more near-term attractive opportunities. Boston Consulting Group predicts that by 2030, the number of individual public charge points will increase tenfold in Europe, where the electric vehicle is gaining ground most rapidly, and that other major markets will experience similar trends.
Our management team and Strategic Capital have specific proficiency in the European market and relationships throughout the automotive industry and supply chain. The landscape is vast in Europe; we believe we have proprietary channels and unique abilities to uncover opportunities and provide strategic relationships to accelerate the growth initiatives of the target company. Sir Dr. Ralf Speth and Dr. Stefan Berger both have strong engineering and information technology backgrounds and experience in the future, zero

emissions mobility space developing the world’s first premium, all-electric performance SUV from a European OEM, the Jaguar I-Pace. Beyond familiarity in the next generation automotive universe, our management team also has experience executing M&A transactions in the context of an evolving transportation industry. Furthermore, Strategic Capital has extensive experience in digital infrastructure and connected intelligence.
Frost & Sullivan expects the autonomous vehicle services market to grow to approximately $203 billion annually by 2030, reflecting a CAGR of 60% from 2019 levels. Additionally, Allied Market Research estimates that the global smart cities market, which includes various information and communication technology platforms, public / private transportation and security infrastructure, and smart energy systems, will collectively comprise approximately $2.4 trillion annually by 2025.
As next-generation electric vehicles represent a larger share of vehicles on the road, we believe tangential opportunities will arise in a variety of subsectors in the ZEV ecosystem. For instance, consumers increasingly will charge passenger vehicles using new charging infrastructure both in their homes and at DC fast charging stations instead of refueling at a gas stations, and value-add components, including electric motors, power electronics, computer hardware and software, will be critical to support this transformation.
As vehicles, devices, applications and cities become smarter and more connected, areas such as data analytics, telematics, mapping, autonomous vehicles and logistics and transportation/transit technology are expected to grow significantly. Smarter, more connected transportation requires monitoring, capturing, processing, communicating and analyzing of vast amounts of data. For example, Intel has estimated that a driverless car will generate more than four terabytes of data per day. This type of data requires transmission across digital connectivity infrastructure systems comprised of wireless towers, wireless spectrum, small cells, distributed antenna systems, fiber networks, data centers, edge locations and various network equipment devices.
Over the next few years, 5G will be a key enabler of greater Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication by supporting latency at ten milliseconds end to end (to and from the application layer) and one millisecond over the air, with very high 99.999% reliability transmissions, according to McKinsey & Company. Moving forward, the vast amounts of real-time generated data should put significant stress on even upcoming 5G network capacity and latency, which would lead to selective processing of certain portions of data at physical locations near where the data is collected in edge computing data centers. The Automotive Edge Computing Consortium advocates this solution to generate significant system-level benefits compared with traditional centralized cloud setups.
This explosion of data creation, transmission, processing and storage in the transportation industry is driving the need for greater integration of transportation and digital connectivity infrastructure to enable higher data speeds, bandwidth throughput and computing power, thereby facilitating a comprehensive transition to a next-generation transportation company with ZEVs in combination with the energy transformation movement.
These related industries in and around next-generation transportation at the nexus of the above referenced energy transformation and digital mobility tailwinds represent a massive opportunity encompassed by the broad scope described below under “Business Combination Criteria.”
Business Combination Criteria
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that align with our business strategy, and which we believe to be important in assessing prospective target businesses. We expect to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, however, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines. We expect to focus on targeting businesses with attractive business fundamentals and the following identifiable characteristics:
● Large, growing industry with significant acquisition opportunities:   We intend to target companies, of which more than 100 are on our prioritized target list, that operate in the next-generation transportation sector, representing a total market size of over $15 trillion, over the next decade as measured across the various third-party estimates for the segments addressed above under “Market Opportunity”. We believe the sector is supported by strong generational industry tailwinds and our management team and board of directors are skilled in analyzing and evaluating companies in this industry based on their significant experience.

● Differentiated European middle-market businesses:   We intend to focus on attractive companies that demonstrate differentiation whether through business model, intellectual property, brand value or technology innovation in energy transformation and digital mobility. Companies in fragmented industries with disruptive platforms that align with our management team’s European and international expertise will be at the forefront of our evaluation process. Our management team and directors have extensive operational, commercial and transactional experience in the North American, European and Asian markets in our target sectors, and we intend to use these skills to identify market leaders.
● Robust financial foundation with growth upside:   We intend to prioritize target companies that are fundamentally sound with a perspective to achieve strong operational performance and free cash flow generation. We intend to focus on opportunities where we can enhance the prospects of our target companies with operational, commercial and financial expertise and provide access to our networks, industry contacts and business relationships. We intend to focus on companies that have demonstrated or have the potential to develop fundamentally sound financial performance with diversity of revenue drivers, visibility into cash flow growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
● Would benefit from our partnership post-initial business combination:   We expect to primarily target companies that can specifically generate value with access to our management team’s expertise in the European and global transportation markets and extensive networks in the mobility sector. We intend to seek companies that can benefit from Sir Dr. Ralf Speth’s executive experience growing Jaguar Land Rover through substantial geographic and product expansions, along with the operational and transactional experience of our directors and Strategic Capital and its affiliates. We will target companies that can clearly benefit from our partnership and which can be enhanced with access to Sir Dr. Ralf Speth’s and Dr. Berger’s automotive leadership experience. More broadly, we believe our management team provides a significant value proposition and we intend to target companies that can specifically leverage our expertise and networks to expedite growth and unlock value. Additionally, we may look to partner with selling shareholders who intend to roll a significant portion of their ownership stake post initial business combination.
● Would benefit from public stock currency, access to incremental capital and additional brand awareness:    We intend to seek companies that demonstrate public company readiness and will use access to public equity markets to pursue accretive acquisitions, prioritize high-return capital projects, strengthen the balance sheet, and recruit and retain key employees. Moreover, we intend to pursue companies that are at an inflection point in their maturation process and require additional capital to facilitate a growth strategy. The founders of our sponsor also have significant experience in this regard, as demonstrated by the equity support of more than $4.5 billion in equity capital that has been raised and/or deployed by affiliates of the founders of our sponsor, across the nine companies that the founders of our sponsor have built since Strategic Capital’s inception.
● Exceptional management and governance:   We intend to focus on target companies that have an experienced and competent management team that has proven itself in building and growing businesses. We also expect to pursue partnerships with management teams that maintain an entrepreneurial mindset and a heightened focus on ESG and CSR initiatives, and will implement best-in-class ESG and CSR practices if they are not already present. We intend to pursue a partnership approach to working with a management team that shares in our strategic vision and believes we can help them achieve the full potential of their business.
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Our Acquisition Process
We have not entered into any definitive agreement to effect a business combination with a business combination target. In evaluating a prospective initial business combination, we expect to conduct a thorough diligence review to determine a company’s quality and intrinsic value. Our review process may include, among other things, detailed document reviews, financial analysis, 

10



management meetings, consultations with customers, competitors and industry experts as well as review of other information that will be made available to us.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. Subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, none of the members of our management team have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Our sponsor and directors and officers are also not prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their initial business combinations, prior to us completing our initial business combination. Our management team, in their capacities as directors, officers or shareholders of our sponsor or its affiliates or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future entities affiliated with or managed by Strategic Capital, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law and any other applicable fiduciary duties. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us and we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. For more information, see the section entitled “Part III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest.”
Members of our management team and our board directly or indirectly own our securities, and accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. For more information, see the section entitled “Part III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest.”
Our directors and officers presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our directors and officers are also not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Certain of our directors and officers are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”
We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers to other entities will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
Public shareholders should not rely on the historical record of our founders’ and management’s performance as indicative of our future performance. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Past performance by our management team and their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company.”
Initial Business Combination
NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry

Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination.
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
We believe this network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, directors or officers. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another valuation or appraisal firm that regularly renders fairness opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
As more fully discussed in “Part III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity 

12



to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our directors and officers currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
Financial Position
With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $219,375,000 as of December 31, 2021, (assuming no redemptions and after payment of up to $7,875,000 of deferred underwriting commissions), we believe we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we believe we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We will effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or the redemptions of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We have not selected any business combination target.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination.
We must meet the 80% of net assets test described above with respect to our initial business combination pursuant to NYSE rules. We will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our 

13



management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information, which will be made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business.
By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry.
Accordingly, the prospects of our success may be:
● solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or
● dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, there can be no assurance that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
There can be no assurance that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.

14



Under the rules of the NYSE, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
● we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
● any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or
● the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
In the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) clear certain trades prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
The purpose of such transaction could be to (1) vote the shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of our initial business combination, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our securities and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of 

15



public shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into private transactions, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by our sponsor, directors, officers and/or any of their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be restricted unless such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, directors, officers and/or any of their respective affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At the completion of our initial business combination, we will be required to redeem any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.10 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders, directors, officers and advisors have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, certain qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors (the “anchor investors”) purchased 1,375,000 Class B ordinary shares from the sponsor. Each of our anchor investors entered into an investment agreement with us pursuant to which they agreed that any founder shares held by them are not entitled to redemption rights in connection with the completion of our initial business combination or in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (1) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
● conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and

16



● file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
● conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
● file proxy materials with the SEC.
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of our issued and outstanding shares which, being so entitled, are voted thereon in person or by proxy at a quorate general meeting of the company or a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our initial shareholders have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote their founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Each of our anchor investors has agreed to vote their founder shares in favor of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers also have agreed to vote in favor of our initial business combination with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our initial shareholders and anchor investors and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares without voting and, if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders, directors, officers and advisors have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or 

17



its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all public shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the ordinary shares sold in the initial public offering (“Excess Shares”), without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, some blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or 

18



her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the scheduled date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering or during any extended time that we have to consummate a business combination beyond 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) as a result of a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (an “Extension Period”).
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period or during any Extension Period.
Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering or during any Extension Period. However, if our initial shareholders acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period. Each of our anchor investors has entered into an investment agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed that any founder shares held by them are not entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares the anchor investor holds in the event we fail to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering or during any Extension Period.

Our sponsor, directors, officers and advisors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,031,397 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2021), although there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. There can be no assurance that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.10. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, there can be no assurance that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver only if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

20



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.10 per share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2021, we had access to up to $1,031,397 from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
If we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable insolvency law, and may be included in our insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account, there can be no assurance we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a voidable performance or preference. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. There can be no assurance that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares; and (3) the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants.
Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to the initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain a provision which provides that, if we seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from the closing of the initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to 

21



the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, we will provide public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such amendment. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:
● prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose, in connection with which public shareholders may seek to redeem their public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to tender their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
● in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions;
● if we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of our issued and outstanding shares which, being so entitled, are voted thereon in person or by proxy at a quorate general meeting of the company or a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company;
● if our initial business combination is not consummated within 15 months (extendable at our sponsor’s option up to 21 months, as described in the Description of Securities exhibit filed as Exhibit 4.5 to this Annual Report) from October 26, 2021, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and
● prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote as a class with our public shares on any initial business combination.
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of shareholders holding a majority of not less than two-thirds of our issued and outstanding shares which, being so entitled, are voted thereon in person or by proxy at a quorate general meeting of the company or a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by shareholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares which being so entitled, are voted thereon in person or by proxy at a quorate general meeting of the company or a unanimous written resolution of all of the shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company.
Additionally, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and that holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by holders of at least 90% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares attending and voting at a quorate general meeting of the company or a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote.
Competition
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry 

22



knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Conflicts of Interest
All of our officers and certain of our directors have fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, which may include Strategic Capital and its affiliates. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. Subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, none of the members of our management team who are also employed by Strategic Capital or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Strategic Capital and directors and officers are also not prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their initial business combinations, prior to us completing our initial business combination. Our management team, in their capacities as directors, officers or shareholders of our sponsor or its affiliates or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future entities affiliated with or managed by Strategic Capital, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law and any other applicable fiduciary duties. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us and we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.
Members of our management team and our board directly or indirectly own our securities, and accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Our directors and officers presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Certain of our directors and officers are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”
We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers to other entities will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
Indemnity
Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a 

23



waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Human Capital
We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, our Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and, as a result, have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) standards. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise 

24



apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on March 30, 2021. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act (2021 Revision) of the Cayman Islands as the same may be amended from time to time (the “Companies Act”). As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands Government that, in accordance with the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 30 years from April 6, 2021, no law which is thereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (1) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (2) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of any relevant payment as defined in the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision).
