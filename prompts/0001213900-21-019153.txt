Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Arcimoto, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Oregon on November 21, 2007. The Company’s mission is to catalyze the global shift to a sustainable transportation system. Over the past 13 years, the Company has developed a new vehicle platform designed around the needs of everyday drivers. Having approximately one-third the weight and one-third of the footprint of the average car, the Arcimoto platform’s purpose is to bring the joy of ultra-efficient, pure electric driving to the masses. To date, the Company has introduced five vehicle products built on this platform that target specific niches in the vehicle market: our flagship product, the Fun Utility Vehicle® (“FUV®”), for everyday consumer trips; the Deliverator® for last-mile delivery and general fleet utility; the Rapid Responder™ for emergency services and security; the Cameo™ for film, sports and influencers; and the Arcimoto Roadster, an unparalleled pure-electric on-road thrill machine.
 
Retail production began on September 19, 2019. In total, Arcimoto produced 57 model year 2019 vehicles, 46 of which were delivered to customers by December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Arcimoto produced 117 model year 2020 vehicles, and delivered 97 vehicles to customers.
 
In March 2020, Arcimoto launched production pilots of the Rapid Responder and Deliverator product lines. In September 2020, the Company on-roaded its fourth product concept, the Cameo. In November 2020, the Company unveiled its fifth product concept, the Arcimoto Roadster prototype.
 
For a portion of 2020, Arcimoto’s production operations were suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company restarted limited production and resumed deliveries to customers in the third quarter.
 
The Company’s focus is now squarely on volume production planning in order to push to sustainable profitability and fulfill the thousands of pre-orders in our queue, as well as to meet the demand generated by our pilot fleet vehicles in the field. The Company is currently preparing an application for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program to secure the funds necessary to execute our growth strategy.
 
Platform and Technologies
 
Arcimoto spent its first decade developing and refining eight generations of a new three-wheeled electric vehicle platform: a light-footprint, nimble reverse-trike architecture that features a low center of gravity for stability on the road; dual-motor front-wheel drive for enhanced traction; can be parked three to a space while carrying two large adults comfortably, and is more efficient, by an order of magnitude, than today’s gas-powered cars. The Company has secured 10 utility patents on various constituent technologies and vehicle platform architectures.
Products
 
Arcimoto’s vehicle products are based on the Arcimoto Platform. While intended to serve very different market segments, an estimated 90% of the constituent parts are the same between all products currently in production and development.
Fun Utility Vehicle® (FUV®)
 
Arcimoto’s flagship product is the Fun Utility Vehicle. The FUV delivers a thrilling ride experience, exceptional maneuverability, comfort for two passengers with cargo, highly-efficient parking (three FUVs to a single parking space), and ultra-efficient operation, all at an affordable price. Over time, we anticipate offering the FUV with several option packages to meet the needs of a variety of customers.
 
We led with a consumer product because we are a consumer-first brand. We believe individuals should be able to choose more efficient, more affordable, and lighter-footprint mobility solutions, so that more of us can participate in the transition to a sustainable transportation future.

Rapid Responder™
 
The Rapid Responder was announced on February 15, 2019. The pure-electric Rapid Responder is developed on the Arcimoto platform, and designed to perform specialized emergency, security and law enforcement services at a fraction of the cost and environmental impact of traditional combustion vehicles. The Rapid Responder aims to deliver first responders to incidents more quickly and affordably than traditional emergency response vehicles.
 
Arcimoto is initially targeting the more than 50,000 fire stations across the United States that use traditional fire engines and large automobiles to respond to calls. Arcimoto also plans to market the Rapid Responder as a solution for campus security and law enforcement applications.
 
Deliverator®
 
Development of the Deliverator was officially announced on March 19, 2019 with the reveal of the first Deliverator prototype.
 
The Deliverator is a pure electric, last-mile delivery solution designed to more quickly, efficiently, and affordably get goods where they need to go. We plan for the Deliverator to be customizable to carry a wide array of products, from pizza, groceries, and cold goods to the 65 billion parcels delivered worldwide annually.
Cameo (™)
 
Arcimoto completed a prototype of the Cameo, an FUV equipped with a rear-facing rear seat and a modified roof built for on-road filming in September 2020. We teased the Cameo prototype in several Arcimoto videos in September 2020 and have used the Cameo to shoot all of our own driving footage since its on-roading. Development of the Cameo is still in the planning stages.
 
The Cameo is aimed at the film industry, as well as the growing influencer and DIY film market.
 
Arcimoto Roadster
 
The Arcimoto Roadster prototype was first introduced in a video released October 30, 2020. Conceived as a pure platform fun machine, the Roadster offers a lower center of gravity, lower overall weight, and potentially improved aerodynamics. We announced the formal development of the Roadster product, in collaboration with industry partners on November 16, 2020.
Autonomous Arcimoto
 
Our long-term goal is to offer the market one of the lowest cost, most efficient “last mile” human and goods transport solutions for the robotically-driven world. We intend that our platform will provide a ready foundation for self-driving technology deployment.
Sales and Distribution Model
 
Arcimoto’s sales and distribution model is direct. Customers place vehicle orders on our website, and the vehicle product will be delivered directly to the end user via common carrier or our own delivery fleet. The website ordering and vehicle configuration system is functional, with further development planned to become more fully automated.
 
On October 26, 2020, we announced a partnership with DHL to provide nationwide home delivery of the FUV. They are currently handling the bulk of our customer deliveries. 
 
Rental Model
 
We plan to augment this direct web purchase process with small-footprint experience rental in select key markets. This rental model will give prospective customers a direct experience with the physical product before purchasing.

Service
 
We are pursuing three different models for service of the FUV:
 
Service-on-demand
 
Our initial model is on-demand and on-site vehicle service by Arcimoto technicians or Arcimoto-authorized technicians. Service-on-demand will likely be the primary model during our West Coast release as the majority of the vehicles will be geographically located relatively near the factory. We intend for customers to request service either through the Arcimoto mobile app or by calling a 24-hour service number.
 
In-market partnership
 
We are currently reviewing potential service partners located in our key distribution regions. We have contracted with Agero Driver Assistance Services, Inc. to provide our customers with roadside assistance. We are currently reviewing Agero’s network of pre-approved third-party service providers, as well as other third-party service providers, to perform service on Arcimoto vehicles. We will be selecting and certifying providers near our customers based on our planned expansion.
 
Retail facility service
 
We plan to employ Arcimoto service technicians at some of our rental locations, depending on the dealer laws in the state. Customers near those rental locations would be able to deliver their vehicle to that location for service needs.
 
Warranty
 
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles we sell for the lesser of three years or thirty-six thousand miles. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is in current portion of warranty reserve, while the remaining balance is in warranty reserve on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
Facility
 
In October 2017, we took possession of our new factory, the AMP, and immediately began retrofitting the space. In December 2017, all employees relocated to the new site and we began operations there. To make the new factory usable for our purposes, we updated the building with brighter energy efficient lighting, polished the production floor to improve cleanliness, painted to increase light levels, remodeled the employee facilities and commenced installation of the manufacturing equipment. Further, we enclosed approximately 8,000 square feet of loading dock area at the AMP to create a well-organized materials space with four truck loading bays, improving inventory management.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we remodeled a 5,700 square foot inventory warehouse located across the street from the AMP into useable office spaces and moved non-manufacturing personnel into these new offices in order to free up production space in the AMP. We also leased an approximately 4,500 square foot retail location in San Diego California to serve as a dealer location and rental center.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we leased an approximately 10,800 square foot building with warehouse and office space approximately six blocks east of the AMP. The office space is being used by our marketing team and the warehouse space is being used by R&D and for battery module manufacturing.
 
During the first quarter of 2020, we leased an approximately 10,800 square foot building with warehouse and office space next to the building leased during the fourth quarter of 2019. This location is being used for service operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we leased an approximately 100 square foot office in Orlando Florida to serve as a dealer location.
 
During the first quarter of 2021, we leased an approximately 15,000 square foot facility that consists of the 2nd floor of the office building located at 155 Blair Blvd., Eugene, OR and also a warehouse located at 135 Blair Blvd., Eugene, OR to serve as a dealer location and rental center.
 
On December 23, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement for the properties located at 311 Chambers St. and 1480 W. 3rd Ave., Eugene, Oregon. The properties consist of an approximately 220,000 square foot warehouse space situated on approximately 10.7 acres. The closing of the sale is scheduled to occur on April 19, 2021. This space will be used for increased production capacity.
 
Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
 
Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, recall, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and other vehicle assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, the regulations in this area are constantly evolving, especially with the entry of new vehicles into the market.
 
Some of the significant standards and regulations affecting Arcimoto are discussed below:
 
Motor Vehicle Safety
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) defines a motorcycle as “a motor vehicle with motive power having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the ground.” In order for a manufacturer to sell motorcycles in the United States, the manufacturer must self-certify to meet a certain set of regulatory requirements promulgated by the NHTSA in its Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
 
In 2018, Arcimoto developed an internal regulatory compliance team to ensure that the FUV production vehicles would meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements for motorcycles. In the third quarter of 2019, we completed the vehicle testing begun in the first quarter of 2019. Arcimoto tested to verify robustness of its vehicle design, to demonstrate compliance with all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards required for motorcycles, and to demonstrate proper function of voluntarily-added equipment such as the FUV’s 3+3 seat belts. At the end of the third quarter of 2019, vehicle testing and regulatory requirements were completed, and we initiated the sales process with our first customers.
 
The Company has had various recalls for issues that have been discovered, which have been partially completed. All proper protocols have been followed for reporting these recalls to NHTSA and to our customers in a timely manner.
 
EPA certification
 
In accordance with 40 CFR 86, Arcimoto successfully completed SAE J2982 Range and MPGe testing, and EPA issued 2019, 2020 and 2021 Model Year Certificate of Conformity for demonstrated compliance as a fully zero emissions, battery-only 3-wheeled electric highway motorcycle.
 
Electromagnetic Compatibility
 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the communications law and regulations, including 47 CFR-15, which regulates unlicensed radio-frequency transmissions, both intentional and unintentional. During 2019, Arcimoto demonstrated that the FUV is in compliance with all required electromagnetic compatibility requirements by testing the vehicle and its components at a test facility accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) for automotive, electromagnetic compatibility, information and communication technologies, and medical devices.

Motor Vehicle Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
 
As with helmet laws and driver license requirements, state laws that regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of motor vehicles are a patchwork nationwide. Where Arcimoto is allowed by statute to be recognized as a dealer, Arcimoto plans to open its own retail distribution facilities or services. For customers living in states where Arcimoto is prohibited from selling directly from within the state, we plan to consummate sales at facilities in Oregon where the customer can pick up or have a common carrier pick up the vehicle.
 
Arcimoto is registered as a manufacturer and dealer in Oregon, Florida and California.
 
Rental Operations
 
Arcimoto’s approach to in-market experience relies on prospective customers renting Arcimoto vehicles. As such, we plan to open Company-owned sites in select locations and may additionally offer independent franchise rental operations in other locations.
State Tax Credits
 
The state of Oregon passed a tax credit qualifying Arcimoto vehicles for a $2,500 tax credit for individuals purchasing qualified electric vehicles and an additional $2,500 tax credit if the purchaser’s annual income is below a certain threshold. Additionally, the Arcimoto FUV qualifies for the California Clean Fuel Reward, offering a $1,500 rebate to California customers at point of sale.
 
We will continue to advocate that state legislatures and regulators include Arcimoto’s affordable, ultra-efficient vehicles in their clean vehicle incentive programs.
 
Federal Tax Credits
 
Arcimoto is part of a coalition of U.S. electric motorcycle manufacturers who are encouraging the federal government to expand the 10% electric motorcycle tax credit to include three-wheeled electric motorcycles as well.
Operator’s License and Helmet Requirements
 
State regulations regarding operator licensing and occupant helmet requirements are currently a nationwide patchwork with regard to three-wheeled vehicles. While the strong majority of states have some form of exemption from helmet and motorcycle license requirements for three-wheeled vehicles, the specific wording of each state’s statute may or may not include Arcimoto platform vehicles. For example, in our initial market states of California and Oregon, three wheeled vehicles that are “fully enclosed” or “enclosed cab” are exempt from helmet and motorcycle endorsement requirements. Washington’s helmet law, by contrast, requires compliance with rollover safety regulations and the presence of a steering wheel to exempt riders.
 
Arcimoto’s advocacy strategy is to work with state legislatures to advocate the normalization of these rules to reduce consumer confusion in the marketplace that comes from conflicting state-by-state regulations.
 
Pollution Control Costs
 
We are required to comply with stationary source air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect with respect to our manufacturing operations.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We have generated a number of patents and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation. As of December 31, 2020, we have ten issued utility patents, including five patents covering novel aspects of the vehicle architecture expiring between 2031 and 2035, three patents covering vehicle battery systems expiring between 2035 and 2038, and two patents covering Arcimoto’s novel dual-motor gearbox design expiring between 2035 and 2037. At present, Arcimoto has an additional patent application undergoing examination that relates to the overall vehicle platform.
 
In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop a competitive position in the market for our products. Each of these patents, patent applications, and know-how are integral to the conduct of our business, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Trademarks
 
Arcimoto, Inc. owns several trademarks including: “Arcimoto”, the winged “A” logo, “Fun Utility Vehicle”, “FUV”, “Deliverator”, and “Rapid Responder”. The Company has registered or applied for registration of these trademarks within the United States. The trademark “Arcimoto” has been registered in China.
Segment Information
 
We operate as one reportable segment which is the design, development, manufacturing, and sales of electric vehicles.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 132 full-time employees and one part-time employee. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our current relations with our employees to be good.
Geographic Areas
 
We operate solely in the United States. As such, we held substantially all our assets and generated all our revenue in the United States during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
Corporate Information
 
We were originally formed on November 21, 2007. Our principal executive offices are located at 2034 West 2nd Ave., Eugene, Oregon 97402, and our phone number is (541) 683-6293.
