Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated on August 20, 2020, in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial public offering (as described below), we have focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns.
Initial Public Offering



On November 12, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 9,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, one right and one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $90,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 479,000 units, 414,000 of which were sold to our sponsor and 65,000 of which were sold to I-Bankers, at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,790,000.



A total of $91,530,000 from the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Our management team is led by Kevin Chen, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Christine Zhao, our Chief Financial Officer and Director, who collectively have expertise in nearly all facets of the healthcare sector and strong expertise in investment management. We must complete our initial business combination by August 12, 2022. If our initial business combination is not consummated by August 12, 2022, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



The Calidi Merger Agreement



This section describes the material provisions of the Calidi Merger Agreement but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following summary of the Calidi Merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Calidi Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and an amendment to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2. Shareholders of the Company and other interested parties are urged to read the Calidi Merger Agreement in its entirety. Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used below have the meanings given to them in the Calidi Merger Agreement.
General Description of the Merger Agreement



On February 2, 2022, the Company, entered into the Calidi Merger Agreement with Edoc Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Edoc (“Merger Sub”), the sponsor, solely in the capacity as the Purchaser Representative from and after the effective time of the Calidi Merger (the “Effective Time”), Calidi, and the Seller Representative.



Pursuant to the Calidi Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) upon the consummation of the Calidi Merger (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Calidi, with Calidi continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In the Calidi Merger, (i) all shares of Calidi common stock (together, “Calidi Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those properly exercising any applicable dissenters rights under Nevada law) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below); and (ii) each outstanding option to acquire shares of Calidi common stock (whether vested or unvested) will be assumed by the Company and automatically converted into an option to acquire shares of the Company common stock, with its price and number of shares equitably adjusted based on the conversion ratio of the shares of Calidi common stock into the Merger Consideration.



The Merger Agreement also provides that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall continue out of the Cayman Islands and into the State of Delaware so as to re-domicile as and become a Delaware corporation (the “Conversion”). At the Closing, the Company will change its name to “Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc.

Merger Consideration



The aggregate merger consideration to be paid pursuant to the Calidi Merger Agreement to holders of Calidi Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Calidi Stockholders” and, together with the holders of Calidi options immediately prior to the Effective Time, the “Calidi Security Holders”) will be an amount equal to $400,000,000, subject to adjustments for Calidi’s closing debt, net of cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The Merger Consideration to be paid to the Calidi Stockholders will be paid solely by the delivery of new shares of our common stock, with each share valued at $10.00 per share. The Merger Consideration will be subject to a post-Closing true up 45 days after the Closing.



The Merger Consideration will be allocated among the holders of Calidi’s common stock, pro rata amongst them based on the number of shares of Calidi common stock owned by such stockholder.



The parties agreed that at or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser Representative, the Seller Representative and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (or such other escrow agent mutually acceptable to Edoc and Calidi), as escrow agent, shall enter into a mutually agreeable escrow agreement, pursuant to which the escrow agent shall be required to holdback approximately 150,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock that would otherwise be issued as Merger Consideration to the Calidi Stockholders, and such shares shall be used to satisfy, in part, any net debt adjustment at the end of the true up period.



Representations and Warranties



The Merger Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of the Company, Merger Sub and Calidi as of the date of the Calidi Merger Agreement and as of the date of the Closing. Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect” as used in the Calidi Merger Agreement means with respect to any specified person or entity, any fact, event, occurrence, change or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of such person or entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of such person or entity or any of its subsidiaries on a timely basis to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Calidi Merger Agreement or the ancillary documents to which it is a party or bound or to perform its obligations thereunder, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Calidi Merger Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the Calidi Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties made by the Company and Calidi are customary for transactions similar to the Calidi Merger.
No Survival



The representations and warranties of the parties contained in the Calidi Merger Agreement terminate as of, and do not survive, the Closing, and there are no indemnification rights for another party’s breach. The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in the Calidi Merger Agreement do not survive the Closing, except those covenants and agreements to be performed after the Closing, which covenants and agreements will survive until fully performed.



Covenants of the Parties



Each party agreed in the Calidi Merger Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing. The Calidi Merger Agreement also contains certain customary covenants by each of the parties during the period between the signing of the Calidi Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or the termination of the Calidi Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the “Interim Period”), including (1) the provision of access to their properties, books and personnel; (2) the operation of their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business; (3) provision of financial statements by Calidi; (4) our public filings; (5) no insider trading; (6) notifications of certain breaches, consent requirements or other matters; (7) efforts to consummate the Closing and obtain third party and regulatory approvals; (8) tax matters; (9) further assurances; (10) public announcements and (11) confidentiality.

The Calidi Merger Agreement requires the approval of both the Company’s shareholders and Calidi’s stockholders. The Company agreed, as promptly as practicable after the date of the Calidi Merger Agreement, to prepare, with reasonable assistance from Calidi, and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended, the “Merger Registration Statement”) in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the issuance of the shares of the Company common stock to be issued to the Calidi Stockholders as Merger Consideration and the registration of the common stock of the Company upon Conversion, and containing a proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of the Company soliciting proxies from the shareholders of the Company to approve the Calidi Merger Agreement (the “Edoc Shareholder Approval”) at a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders and providing such shareholders an opportunity to participate in the redemption by the Company of its public shareholders in connection with the Company’s initial business combination, as required by the Company’s amended and restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Company’s initial public offering prospectus (the “Redemption”). Calidi also agreed in the Calidi Merger Agreement to call a meeting of its stockholders use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from Calidi Stockholders proxies in favor of the Calidi Merger Agreement and the Calidi Merger and certain related matters (the “Calidi Stockholder Approval”), and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure such approvals, including enforcing the Voting Agreement (as described below).



The parties also agreed to take all necessary action, so that effective at the Closing, the entire board of directors of the Company (the “Post-Closing Board”) will consist of seven individuals, four of whom shall be independent directors in accordance with Nasdaq requirements. One of the members of the Post-Closing Board will be an individual (who shall be an independent director) designated by the Company prior to the Closing and five of the members of the Post-Closing Board (at least three of whom shall be independent directors) will be designated by Calidi prior to the Closing and one of the members of the Post-Closing Board will be an individual (who shall be an independent director) mutually agreed to by the Company and Calidi. At or prior to Closing, the Company will provide each of its director designees with a customary director indemnification agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such director. The parties also agreed to take all action necessary including causing the Company’s executive officers of Purchaser to resign, so that the individuals serving as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, of the Company immediately after the Closing will be the same individuals as that of Calidi immediately prior to the Closing.



Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Calidi Merger Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements with investors to purchase preferred and common shares of the Company in connection with a private equity investment in the Company for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of up to Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the “PIPE Investment”), which PIPE Investment is expected to close contemporaneously with the Business Combination. During the Interim Period, in addition to the PIPE Investment, the Company may but is not required to, enter into agreements with potential investors for alternative equity financing for an aggregate amount of proceeds of up to Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) on terms mutually agreeable to Calidi and the Company, and if so, Calidi agreed to cooperate in connection with such PIPE Investment and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such alternative equity financing to occur.



The Company agreed to use its best efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the effective date of the Merger Registration Statement to, obtain: the approval of the Company shareholders to amend the organizational documents of the Company to provide that (i) the name of the Company shall be changed to “Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc.” or such other name as mutually agreed upon and (ii) remove and change certain provisions in the Memorandum and Articles related to the Company’s status as a blank check company, and file the amended organizational documents with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.



The parties agree that Purchaser shall have until 5:00 p.m. on February 18, 2022, to conduct additional legal due diligence and review of the Company’s disclosure schedules (the “Due Diligence Period”) on the Target Companies to determine whether its due diligence findings or any disclosure on the Company Disclosure Schedules is reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on the business of the Surviving Corporation and in such event Purchaser in its reasonable discretion may elect not to terminate.

Related Agreements

The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each of the additional agreements, copies of each of which are attached as exhibits to this Report. Shareholders and other interested parties are urged to read such additional agreements in their entirety.

The Voting Agreement prevents transfers of the Calidi Stock held by such stockholder between the date of the Voting Agreement and the date of Closing, except for certain permitted transfers where the recipient also agrees to comply with the Voting Agreement.



Lock-Up Agreement



Simultaneously with the execution of the Calidi Merger Agreement, each Significant Stockholder entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with the Company and the Purchaser Representative (each, a “Lock-Up Agreement”).



Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement, with respect to the shares received as Merger Consideration, each Significant Stockholder shall agree not to, during the period commencing from the Closing and (A) with respect to 50% of the Merger Consideration shares, ending on the earliest of (a) the six-month anniversary of the Closing, (b) the date on which the Closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period and (c) the date that the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of the Company shareholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in the Company for cash, securities or other property (a “Subsequent Transaction”) and (B) with respect to the remaining 50% of the Merger Consideration shares, ending on the earliest of (a) the six-month anniversary of the Closing and (b) a Subsequent Transaction: (i) lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any restricted securities, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the restricted securities, or (iii) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing.



The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the agreements the Company entered into with an institutional investor (the “PIPE Investor”) for an investment of $20 million in the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and $5 million in the Company’s common stock (after giving effect to the Conversion) conditioned upon, among other things, the consummation of the Business Combination. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each of the agreements. The full text of these agreements, or forms thereof, will be filed as exhibits to this Report, and the following descriptions are qualified in their entirety by the full text of such exhibits.



Securities Purchase Agreement



On February 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with the PIPE Investor for the purchase and sale of 20,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Shares”) for $1,000 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million and 500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Common Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $5 million upon the Conversion and concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination. The closing of the PIPE Investment is conditioned upon, among other things, the listing of the Common Stock, Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares (as such terms are defined in the SPA) on the Nasdaq Stock Market. All conditions precedent to the closing of the Merger set forth in the Calidi Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the approval the Company’s shareholders and Calidi stockholders, shall have been satisfied or waived, as well as other customary closing conditions and deliverables. At the closing of the PIPE Investment, the PIPE Investor will also be issued a common stock purchase warrant to purchase up to an additional 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial exercise price equal $11.50 per share, for a term of three years from the closing date of the PIPE Investment.

Under the terms of the SPA and the agreed upon form of Certificate of Designations (the “COD”) setting forth the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions for the Preferred Shares, the Preferred Shares will be entitled to convert into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial fixed conversion price of $10.00 per share, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99% which can be adjusted to a beneficial ownership limitation of 9.99% upon 61 days prior written notice. For purposes of calculating the beneficial ownership limitation, the PIPE Investor’s beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock will be calculated under the rules promulgated under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). If there were no beneficial ownership limitation in the COD, the Preferred Shares would be entitled to convert into 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock immediately after the closing of the PIPE Investment, or approximately 3.8% of the Company’s anticipated issued and outstanding shares of common stock assuming no redemptions.



Under the terms of the COD, after a thirty (30) day period from the closing, in the event that the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for the five days prior to conversion of the Preferred Shares is less than the fixed conversion price of $10.00 per share, or other triggering events, the Preferred Shares are entitled to convert at a price equal to 90% of the price computed as the quotient of (I) the sum of the VWAP of the Common Stock for each of the two (2) Trading Days with the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice, divided by (II) two (2), but not less than 20% of the fixed conversion price, or if forty five days after the closing the Common Stock the average daily dollar volume for a ten day period is less than $4,000,000, then the Preferred Shares are entitled to convert at the lower of the fixed conversion price or 80% of the price computed as the quotient of (I) the sum of the VWAP of the Common Stock for each of the two (2) Trading Days with the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice, divided by (II) two (2) but not less than 20% of the fixed conversion price. In addition, the common stock purchase warrants provide for an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrant in the event of a “new issuance” of Common Stock, or common stock equivalents, at a price less than the applicable exercise price of the common stock purchase warrant. The adjustment is a “full ratchet” adjustment in exercise price of the common stock purchase warrant equal to the lower of the new issuance price or the then existing exercise price of the common stock purchase warrants, with few exceptions.



If certain defined “triggering events” defined in the COD occur, such as a breach of the Registration Rights Agreement, suspension of trading, or the Company’s failure to convert the Preferred Shares into common stock when a conversion right is exercised, failure to issue the Company’s common stock when the common stock purchase warrant is exercised, or other events relating to defaults relating to the Company’s credit agreements or judgments issued by the courts exceeding specified thresholds,, then the Preferred Shares are entitled to convert at the lower of the fixed conversion price equal or 80% of the price computed as the quotient of (I) the sum of the VWAP of the Common Stock for each of the two (2) Trading Days with the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice, divided by (II) two (2), but not less than 20% of the fixed conversion price. In the event that the Company files for bankruptcy or other experiences other events of insolvency, the Preferred Shares must be redeemed for cash.



The COD also provides that the Company may redeem the Preferred Shares for an amount equal to 150% of its Stated Value upon 20 days prior written notice during which time the holder of Preferred Shares would be entitled to convert the Preferred Shares into Common Stock in accordance with its conversion rights.



The Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference equal to an amount per Preferred Share equal to the sum of (i) the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Warrants) with respect to the outstanding portion of all Warrants held by such Holder (as defined in the COD) (without regard to any limitations on the exercise thereof) as of the date of such event and (ii) the greater of (A) 125% of the Conversion Amount (as defined in the COD) of such Preferred Share on the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common Stock immediately prior to the date of such payment, and will be entitled to convert into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial fixed conversion price of $10.00 per share, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99% which can be adjusted to a beneficial ownership limitation of 9.99% upon 61 days prior written notice.



In connection with the purchase and sale of 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $10.00 per share, we have agreed that on the 90th day after the Closing and on the twentieth (20th) trading day after the registration statement filed under the Registration Rights Agreement is declared effective to issue the PIPE Investor additional shares of Common Stock in the event that the quotient of (x) the sum of the VWAP of the Common Stock on each Trading Day during the twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on, and including, such measuring dates, divided by (y) twenty (20) is less than $10.00 per share (the “Make-up Price Failure Measuring Price”). In that event, the Company would be obligated to issue a number of additional shares of Common Stock derived by the greater of zero or (x) 120% of the quotient of (I) $5,000,000, divided by (II) the Make-up Price Failure Measuring Price and (y) the sum of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued on the Closing Date and the Initial Make-up Share Amount consisting of the greater of (A) zero (0) and (B) the difference of (x) 120% of the quotient of (I) $5,000,000, divided by (II) the applicable Make-Up Price Failure Measuring Price for such dates and (y) the aggregate number of Common Shares (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) issued at the Closing Date.



The SPA terminates if the Closing does not occur on or before August 2, 2022, the outside Closing Date under the Calidi Merger Agreement, or after five (5) days have transpired following the date that all conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or waived, or immediately upon notice at the election of the PIPE Investor.

Registration Rights Agreement



Concurrently with the execution of the SPA, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “RRA”) with the PIPE Investor in which the Company have agreed to register the shares of the Company’s common stock purchased by the PIPE Investor and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares and the exercise of the common stock purchase warrant with the SEC for resale. Under the RRA, the Company agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC within 30 days of the Closing, and to have the registration statement declared effective within 60 calendar days from the date the registration statement is filed. The RRA also contains usual and customary liquidated damages provisions for failure to file and failure to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within the time periods specified.

Backstop Agreements



On February 2, 2022, the Company entered into certain backstop arrangements with Sea Otter Securities (“Sea Otter”), Stichting Juridisch Eigendom Mint Tower Arbitrage Fund (“Mint Tower”), Feis Equities LLC (“Feis”), Yakira Capital Management, Inc. (“Yakira Capital”), Yakira Enhanced Offshore Fund (“Yakira Fund”) and Yakira Partners LP, MAP 136 Segregated Portfolio (“Yakira LP”, and together with Yakira Capital and Yakira Fund, “Yakira”), and Meteora Capital Partners, LP (“Meteora” and together with Sea Otter, Mint Tower, and Feis, Yakira, the “Backstop Investors”), which provide that such investors will not redeem up to 2,220,000 shares that they hold, in the aggregate, in connection with (i) the Company’s shareholder meeting to approve an extension of the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 12, 2022 to August 12, 2022 (the “Extension”), and (ii) the proposed business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) involving the Company and Calidi. Such Backstop Investors have agreed to each either hold such shares for a period of time following the consummation of the Business Combination, at which time they will each have the right to sell them to the combined entity, after giving effect to the Business Combination (the “New PubCo”), at $10.42 per share, or will sell such shares on the open market during such time period at a market price of at least $10.27 per share.
Forward Share Purchase Agreements



On February 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Forward Share Purchase Agreement (the “Meteora Purchase Agreement”) with Meteora. Pursuant to the terms of the Meteora Purchase Agreement, Meteor agreed to (i) not request redemption of up to 550,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company (the “Meteora Shares”) in conjunction with the Company’s shareholders’ approval of either the Extension or the Business Combination, or (ii) tender the Meteora Shares to the Company in response to any redemption or tender offer that the Company may commence for its Class A ordinary shares (the “Restrictions”), subject to adjustment as set forth in the Meteora Purchase Agreement.



In exchange for agreeing to the Restrictions, the New Pubco has agreed that, upon the timely request of Meteora, it will acquire the Meteora Shares at a price of $10.42 per share on the three-month anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination (the “Business Combination Closing Date”). Meteora shall notify New PubCo and the Escrow Agent (as defined in the Meteora Purchase Agreement) in writing (a “Sales Notice”) no later than three (3) business days prior to the three-month anniversary of the Business Combination Closing Date whether or not they are exercising their right to sell the Meteora Shares to New Pubco pursuant to the Meteora Purchase Agreement (each, a “Meteora Shares Sale Notice”). If the closing sale price of the Meteora Shares on the third (3rd) business day prior to the three (3) month anniversary of the Business Combination is less than $10.42 per Share, Meteora’s right to sell will be deemed automatically exercised as to all then-held Meteora Shares, without the need to deliver a Sales Notice.



Meteora agreed to maintain a net long position of the EDOC and/or the Company’s securities during the term of this Agreement.

Simultaneously with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company will deposit into an escrow account with the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of an escrow agreement to be entered into prior to the Business Combination, up to $10.42 multiplied by the number of Meteora Shares held by Meteora as of the closing of the Business Combination. New Pubco’s purchase of the Meteora Shares will be made with funds from the escrow account attributed to the Meteora Shares. In the event that Meteora sells any Meteora Shares as provided for above, it shall provide an Open Market Sale Notice (as defined in the Meteora Purchase Agreement) to New Pubco and Escrow Agent within three business days of such sale, if, as a result of such sales, Meteora hold less than an aggregate of 550,000 Class A ordinary shares, and the Escrow Agent shall release from the escrow account to New Pubco an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the escrow attributed to the Meteora Shares which Meteora have sold; provided that if Meteora sells any Meteora Shares before the one (1) month anniversary of the Business Combination Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account: (a) to Meteora, an amount equal to the number of Meteora Shares sold multiplied by $0.05, and (b) to New Pubco, an amount equal to the number of Meteora Shares sold multiplied by $10.37. Other than as described above in the event that Meteora chooses not to sell to New Pubco any Meteora Shares that they own as of the three-month anniversary of the Business Combination Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release all remaining funds from the escrow account to the Company for the Company’s use without restriction.



The Company agreed to indemnify Meteora and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and shareholders (collectively referred to as the “Meteora Indemnitees”) against, and hold them harmless of and from, any and all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense, including without limitation, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket outside counsel fees, which the Meteora Indemnitees may suffer or incur by reason of any action, claim or proceeding, in each case, brought by a third party creditor of the Company, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries asserting that Meteora are not entitled to receive escrowed funds or such portion thereof as they are entitled to receive pursuant to the Meteora Purchase Agreement, in each case unless such action, claim or proceeding is the result of the fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of any Meteora Indemnitee.



The Meteora Purchase Agreement may be terminated: (i) by mutual written consent of the Company and Meteora; (ii) at the election of Meteora if the Company’s shareholders fail to approve the Business Combination before August 12, 2022, subject to extension by mutual agreement; (iii) prior to the closing of the Business Combination by mutual agreement of Meteora if there occurs a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Calidi Merger Agreement); (iv) by Meteora if prior to the day that is five (5) business days prior to the date of the Business Combination Meeting, the Company, Meteora and the Escrow Agent have not executed the Escrow Agreement (as defined in the Meteora Purchase Agreement); and (v) by Meteora, if prior to February 7, 2022, the Company does not reach substantially similar non-redemption or forward purchase agreements with Additional Investors (as defined in the Meteora Purchase Agreement) committing an aggregate of 2,200,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company to the same restrictions included in the Meteora Purchase Agreement.



The Company has also entered into share purchase agreements with identical terms to the Meteora Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Forward Purchase Agreements”) with Sea Otter (covering 550,000 shares), with Mint Tower (covering 550,000 shares), Feis (covering 275,000 shares) and Yakira (covering 275,000 shares). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time from July 12, 2022, until four (4) trading days prior to the Business Combination Meeting, the Company, in its sole discretion, may reduce the number of shares to be purchased by the Backstop Investors pursuant to the Backstop Agreements. In such event, any reduction will be made and applied to the Backstop Investors on a pro rata basis.



The foregoing description is only a summary of the Forward Purchase Agreements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Forward Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.25 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The form of Forward Purchase Agreement is included as an exhibit to this Report in order to provide investors and security holders with material information regarding its terms and the transaction. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or the Backstop Investors. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Forward Purchase Agreements were made only for purposes of that agreement; are solely for the benefit of the parties to the Forward Purchase Agreements; may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Forward Purchase Agreements instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Security holders and investors should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or the Backstop Investor.

Founder Share Transfer Agreement



In connection with the above-mentioned arrangements, the Sponsor entered into certain share transfer agreements (the “Founder Share Transfer Agreements”) with the Backstop Investors.



Pursuant to the Founder Share Transfer Agreement with Meteora on February 2, 2022 (the “Meteora Share Transfer Agreement”), Meteora agreed not to sell, transfer or seek redemption of an aggregate of 550,000 public shares of the Company and to vote such shares in favor of the Extension and the Business Combination.



In consideration of Meteora’s agreement to abide by such restrictions on its public shares, the Sponsor agreed to transfer to Meteora an aggregate of up to 141,212 shares of the Company Class B ordinary shares (the “Transferred Founder Shares”). Of such amount, 84,727 founder shares shall be transferred within five business days following the Extension Meeting (as defined in the Meteora Founder Share Transfer Agreement). Additionally, f the Business Combination has not consummated by May 12, 2022, then for each monthly period from May 12, 2022 until August 12, 2022 that the Business Combination has not closed (each such monthly period, a “Month”), then the Company shall cause to be paid to Meteora, at the Company’s discretion, either (i) a cash amount of $0.05 per Meteora Share not redeemed by Meteora, for an aggregate of up to $0.15 per Public Share, or (ii) or 0.034 Transferred Founder Shares per Meteora Share not redeemed by Meteora in connection with the Extension Meeting, to be transferred by the Sponsor (or its designees), for an aggregate of up to 0.1027 Transferred Founder Shares per share. Such payment(s) will be made within five (5) business days following each of May 12, 2022, June 12, 2022, and July 12, 2022, to the extent that the Business Combination has not closed by such dates.



The Company has also entered into founder shares transfer agreements with identical terms to the Meteora Share Transfer Agreement with Sea Otter (pursuant to which up to 141,212 founder shares will be transferred to Sea Otter), with Mint Tower (pursuant to which up to 141,212 founder shares will be transferred to Mint Tower), Feis (pursuant to which up to 70,605 founder shares will be transferred to Feis) and Yakira (pursuant to which up to 70,605 founder shares will be transferred to Yakira).



Any founder shares transferred pursuant to the Founder Share Transfer Agreements will be subject to the same rights and obligations as the remaining founder shares held by the Sponsor, including certain registration rights and the obligations to (a) vote any founder shares held by them in favor of the Business Combination, and (b) subject any founder shares held by them to the same lock-up restrictions as the founder shares held by the Sponsor.



The foregoing description is only a summary of the Founder Share Transfer Agreements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Founder Share Transfer Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.26 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The form of Founder Share Transfer Agreement is included as an exhibit to this Report on in order to provide investors and security holders with material information regarding its terms and the transaction. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Sponsor or the Backstop Investors. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Founder Share Transfer Agreements were made only for purposes of that agreement; are solely for the benefit of the parties to the Founder Share Transfer Agreements; may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Founder Share Transfer Agreements instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Security holders and investors should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Sponsor or the Backstop Investors.



Extensions



On November 9, 2021, the sponsor requested that the Company extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 12, 2021, to February 12, 2022. The extension was the first of up to two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents. In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate of $900,000 to be deposited into the Company’s trust account on November 10, 2021.



On February 9, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the time in which the Company may consummate a business combination from February 12, 2022, to August 12, 2022.



On February 9, 2022, Edoc held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to which Edoc’s shareholders approved extending the date by which Edoc had to complete a business combination from February 12, 2022 to August 12, 2022. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 6,326,758 Ordinary Shares. As a result, an aggregate of $64,996,857.71 (or approximately $10.27 per share) was released from the Trust Account to pay such shareholders and 5,477,242 Ordinary Shares were issued and outstanding at February 11, 2022.



Our Business



Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.

We believe the health care sector has experienced a significant amount of change over the last several months. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on the healthcare sector remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic from time to time. However, we believe that these challenges may also lead to meaningful acquisition opportunities, such as the Calidi Merger. In addition, we see long-term catalyst in accelerating the broader adoption of telemedicine.



We have employed a pro-active acquisition strategy focused on identifying potential business combination targets in the healthcare sector, as seen with the Calidi Merger. Possible targets have included hospitals or hospital networks, specialty clinics chain, chronic disease health care service providers, telemedicine/digital health providers and/or associated technology/platform enablers, or artificial intelligence/big data enabled diagnostic providers. We believe strongly in our management team’s ability to add value from both an operating and a financing perspective which has been a key driver of past performance and we believe will continue to be central to its differentiated acquisition strategy.



Business Strategy



We seek to create compelling shareholder value by leveraging the track record, strong network, and complementary experience of our management team and sponsor affiliate, which includes experts in nearly all facets of the healthcare sector and strong expertise in investment management.



Our sponsor’s members, affiliates and contacts (“Affiliated Physicians”) comprise a significant network of physicians in the United States, Canada, and Europe with ties to the Asia-Pacific region. 38 of our sponsor’s members are physicians. Our sponsor’s relationship with the Society of Chinese American Physician Entrepreneurs (“SCAPE”) (approximately 445 physicians) and the World Association of Chinese Doctors (“WACD”) (over 20,000 physicians), represents a significant opportunity to source target business combinations and business relationships. Through our sponsor, SCAPE, and WACD, among other relationships, our member and affiliated physicians represent over 30 specialty fields of medicine, and represent practices located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and elsewhere.



Our Affiliated Physicians are employed by, have practice privileges, or other affiliations or appointments with leading medical institutions including the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, New York Presbyterian, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, UCLA Medical Center, UCSF Medical Center, Stanford University, and Duke University.



Our sponsor entered into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, to place limit orders, through ED&F Man Capital Markets Inc., an independent broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange Act which is not affiliated with us nor part of the underwriting or selling group, to purchase an aggregate of up to 3,750,000 of our rights in the open market at market prices, and not to exceed $0.20 per right during the period commencing on the later of (i) December 10, 2020, the date separate trading of the rights commenced or (ii) sixty calendar days after the end of the “restricted period” under Regulation M, continuing until the date that was the earlier of (a) November 9, 2021 and (b) the date that we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination, or earlier in certain circumstances as described in the limit order agreement. The limit orders required such members of our sponsor to purchase any rights offered for sale (and not purchased by another investor) at or below a price of $0.20, until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the buyback period or (y) the date such purchases reach 3,750,000 rights in total. Our sponsor would not have any discretion or influence with respect to such purchases and will not be able to sell or transfer any rights purchased in the open market pursuant to such agreements until following the consummation of a business combination. It was intended that the broker’s purchase obligation would be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M under the Exchange Act, which may prohibit or limit purchases pursuant to the limit order agreement in certain circumstances. I-Bankers also agreed to purchase up to 1,250,000 of our rights in the open market at market prices not to exceed $0.20 per right, on substantially similar terms as our sponsor. The obligations to make any such purchases expired on November 9, 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, no limit orders were placed by our sponsor or I-Bankers.

Market Opportunity



Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating an initial business combination, we are focusing on businesses within the healthcare space in Asia-Pacific and North America with an overall transaction value between $300 million and $1.0 billion.



We believe the healthcare sector is well poised for strong growth over the long-term given aging demographic trends. Population growth, combined with increased economic power and efforts to expand public health systems, will likely result in higher health care spending. As care deferrals are reduced when the pandemic subsides the sector represents short-term attractive target markets given the size, breadth and prospects for growth.



According to Deloitte Insights 2020 Global Healthcare Outlook —




● | Health care spending is expected to rise at a CAGR of 5% over 2019 – 2023, up from 2.7% in 2014 – 2018 and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global health care spending as a share of GDP will likely remain at around 10.2% through 2023, equal to 2018’s ratio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Global MD 2020 State of Telemedicine Report —




● | Between 2020 and 2023, telemedicine services in the United States is expected to increase by 265%, from US$29 billion in 2020 to US$106 billion in 2023 per year and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The number of doctors providing telemedicine and virtual outpatient services doubled in the second half of 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated digital adoption due to COVID-19 related quarantine and stay-at-home measures, need for social distancing, with telemedicine spending and usage expected to increase significantly from pre-COVID levels. The number of doctors providing telemedicine and virtual outpatient services doubled in the second half of 2020, according to the Global MD 2020 State of Telemedicine Report.



Strong Healthcare growth opportunities in Asia — There has been a significant gap in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP and healthcare service quality, creating what we believe to be a large degree of room for spending increases and enhancements in service standards in Asia.



Asian countries will likely contribute around half of global growth in high income households (Deloitte insights 2020 Global Healthcare Outlook).



We have not narrowed our business combination target to any particular healthcare business; however, we are exploring the following potential markets:




● | Telemedicine/digital health providers and/or associated technology/platform enablers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Artificial intelligence/big data enabled diagnostic providers or clinical data analytical platform provider; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Private hospitals and specialty clinic chains, in particular those with higher patient economics such as on oncology, orthopedics, dental, plastic surgery, rehabilitation and chronic disease management. These specialty hospitals/clinic chains tend to have higher patient concentrate/occupancy, larger treatment ticket size and better margin.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria



We have sought and will continue to seek to identify companies that have compelling market presence, growth potential and a combination of the following characteristics. We have used and continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies or assets that we believe have the following attributes:

● | Growth Potential: high growth history and future trajectory in revenue top line, above industry average;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Position: Leading or growing market share compared to peer group;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management Team: Talented, highly motivated, experienced with strong execution track record;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Profitability or visible path to profitability: Strong business economics and good operating results leading to profitability; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solid technology in digital and/or AI/big data-assisted healthcare applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.



Status as a Public Company



We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as Calidi. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See “The Calidi Merger” above for more information regarding such exchange in the Calidi Merger. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.



Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the Calidi Merger, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.



Financial Position



With funds available for an initial business combination initially in the amount of $92,430,000 (as of December 31, 2021), we offer a target business, such as Calidi, a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints. See “The Calidi Merger” above for more information on the PIPE Investment.




14







Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period of time. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement units, our share capital debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



Sources of Target Businesses



We receive proprietary transaction opportunities as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities from the network built up by our management team and by the members of our Board. Target business candidates, such as Calidi, have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Kevin Chen and Christine Zhao has agreed that if he or she becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that might be suitable to the Company’s business or investment strategy through his or her directorship in another blank check company, he or she will recuse herself from all discussions, deliberations, or decisions of the other blank check company with respect to such opportunity.

Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the Calidi management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Calidi Merger is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, including the Calidi Merger, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we have conducted and will continue conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



See “The Calidi Merger” above for more information on the financing and Ancillary Agreements of the Calidi Merger.




16







Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses



So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, the target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, if we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account.



In order to consummate such an initial business combination, like the Calidi Merger, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities (although our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we may not issue securities that can vote with ordinary shareholders on matters related to our pre-initial business combination activity). If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination.



We will structure our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business, but we will only consummate such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes) or are otherwise not required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act. Even though we will own a majority interest in the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of Calidi was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination



We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement (as is the case with the Calidi Merger), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.




17







Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholder (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% of greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:




● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




See “The Calidi Merger” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Calidi Merger. 



Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination



On November 9, 2021, the sponsor requested that the Company extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 12, 2021, to February 12, 2022. The extension was the first of up to two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents. In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate of $900,000 to be deposited into the Company’s trust account on November 10, 2021.



On February 9, 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the time in which the Company may consummate a business combination from February 12, 2022, to August 12, 2022.



On February 9, 2022, Edoc held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to which Edoc’s shareholders approved extending the date by which Edoc had to complete a business combination from February 12, 2022 to August 12, 2022. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 6,326,758 Ordinary Shares. As a result, an aggregate of $64,996,857.71 (or approximately $10.27 per share) was released from the Trust Account to pay such shareholders and 5,477,242 Ordinary Shares were issued and outstanding at February 11, 2022.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination, such as the Calidi Merger, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2021, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.27 per share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by certain advisory fees we will pay to I-Bankers. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.




18







Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.



We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.



If we seek shareholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private shares and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.



In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote in conjunction with their initial business combination for business or other legal reasons (so long as shareholder approval is not required by the rules of Nasdaq), we will conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association. In such case, we will:




● | offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act.




19







In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of ordinary shares that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased.



When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer.



Limitation on Redemption Rights upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval



If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” either by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court.



See “The Calidi Merger” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals and the redemption rights related to the Calidi Merger. 



Permitted Purchases of Our Securities by Our Affiliates



If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.




20







The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.



See “The Calidi Merger” above for more information regarding such purchases related to the Calidi Merger.



Tendering Share Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights



We will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target until August 12, 2022.




21







Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only until August 12, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination by August 12, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by August 12, 2022. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.



Our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by August 12, 2022 (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).



Our initial shareholders, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 12, 2022 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $223,398 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2021, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.27. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.17, plus interest (net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses). While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.




22







Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum and the representative for the underwriter will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.27 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.27 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against our sponsor, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our initial shareholders, officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.27 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.27 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.27 per public share.



We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to the amounts held outside the trust account ($223,398 as of December 31, 2020) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder.

If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.27 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 12, 2022, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 12, 2022or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by August 12, 2022, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as Calidi, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, and our outstanding rights and warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees



We have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time our officers devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination within our 12-month (or up to 18-month, as applicable) time frame.



We are required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 12, 2025, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
