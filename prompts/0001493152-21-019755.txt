Item 1. Business
 
Description of the Business
 
The following description of our business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report, including those set forth above in the Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements or under the heading “Risk Factors” or elsewhere.
 
Business Overview
 
BioQuest, Corporation – plans to market, package and distribute health Hemp-CBD based products. Our mission is to Create High End, Products and aggregate all relevant CBD content in the Nutraceutical markets. In addition, BioQuest will also be positioned to generate revenue by acquiring established companies who have a current presence in the nutraceutical and CBD industry if the opportunity presents itself and bring its products to the market generating immediate revenues, created and marketed by BioQuest.
 
We believe that we can build our Company into a recognizable brand in the Nutraceutical and Pharmaceutical industry. We recognized early on the importance of creating a strong, identifiable, and lasting brand that would separate our Company from the competition and resonate with customers. Our logo, our name, the style of our ads, and all collateral material will reflect our “brand image.” Since the legalization of medical and recreational CBD, numerous states have created new and exciting markets with great investment potential.
 
We will sell primarily into the business-to-business market and internet-based business to consumer, which includes legally operating medical and adult-use dispensaries, store fronts, and brand owners in states with CBD programs.
 
In addition to our existing product line of high-end women products, our proposed products, which are currently still in development, will contain both non-CBD and CBD ingredients that are derived from hemp. A specialized extraction process is used to yield highly concentrated CBD oil that also contains other potentially nutritious materials such as omega-3 fatty acids, terpenes (a class of organic compounds which when modified are used in a variety of medicines and alternative medicines such as aromatherapy), vitamins, chlorophyll, and amino acids. Our existing and proposed products have no THC and are parasite-free.
 
BioQuest’s mission is to lead the industry in bringing unique Men’s, Women’s, Lifestyle and Pet products that are (CBD) based products to the marketplace. We strive to educate the world on the benefits of hemp extract, and it is our goal to offer the industry’s highest quality products.
 
We have been reviewing all of our marketing and other efforts to ensure that it is clear that no claims of any medical or health benefit be made by us or anyone representing us with regard to any of our proposed products. These proposed products are not pre-approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency. We do not make any claims not covered by actual research. However, users rely on statements made on social media by many users of similar products. We have no association with any of the individuals posting about these types of products on social media.
 
The unique strains of cannabinoid-rich hemp are specially bred from the most medicinally high cannabidiol strains of medical cannabis. These plants with the highest CBD and lowest THC concentrations were stabilized and cross bred. This resulted in consistent plant levels of less than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis.
 
Our company is in the development stage and has generated no revenues.

Sales and Distribution
 
We will sell our proposed products through our direct to consumer, large retail chains, small chains, and store fronts, and to retailers around the U.S. Customers can use credit cards for direct purchases from us. We are working to begin selling our potential products, using different sales techniques, and optimizing our website. Customers who purchase a certain amount of our planned products receive free shipping and handling on their purchases. We cannot predict the likelihood of success in using these techniques.
Competition
 
The CBD industry is relatively new but showing large growth. Some of our most likely competitors are Charlotte’s Web, CBDistillary, and Veritas Farms, all of whom are in the CBD space. Many of these companies have greater resources and market recognition than we currently have available. There is also a possibility of a larger entity trying to acquire many of the smaller companies in the industry, especially if regulatory uncertainties lessen. We plan on competing using specific products that we believe meet customer demands, selling them at prices that are very affordable in relation to other products in the marketplace. We cannot predict the likelihood of succeeding in these efforts.
Suppliers
 
Our future products will be made by independent vendors, with third party lab tests for each individual product batch uploaded to our website. We will purchase our potential products from select vendors. All ingredients that we will purchase are purchased by the vendors. All products will be tested by these vendors to ensure no presence of THC. The vendors primarily package and label the items being delivered to us. We have not experienced nor are we aware of any shortages of supplies available.
The Cannabinoid Industry
 
The Brightfield Group “is calling for year-over-year CBD product sales from $5B in 2020 to around $17B by 2025. With the 20 largest companies commanding less than 17% of the total Market, we are aggressively evaluating other “Non-Public” companies for possible acquisitions.
 
During the Covid-19 Period, the market has dramatically increased with 50-60% of purchases made online.
 
By all measures, the market for hemp, and for products based on extracts of hemp, is expected to grow substantially over the coming years.
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces some major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of Hemp is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many hemp entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to hemp producers and retailers. Secondly, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabinoid business.
 
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, and distribution of our future products. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses.”
 
The principal uncertainties are whether regulators will, at any time, attempt to treat CBD products similarly to THC products.
 
Some states are considering various taxation of cannabis-related products. These considerations seem to range from routine sales taxes to taxes similar to those imposed on tobacco products. It is unclear whether products containing Hemp Derived CBD would fall under these tax plans if and when they are imposed.

IRS section 280E prevents cannabis companies from deducting expenses from their income, except for those considered cost of goods sold. No deduction or credit is allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by Federal law or the law of any State in which such trade or business is conducted. If this section is enforced against the Company even though its future products contain no THC or other illegal substance, it could create serious operating and cash flow problems in the future.
 
Regulation
 
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our future products, software, and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses.”
 
Our operations are potentially subject to a complex web of Federal and state regulations that are evolving at a rapid rate. The USDA and FDA may change rules or enforcement proceedings at any time. We do not believe that current rules and enforcement have a significant potential impact because we only use Hemp Derived CBD which is Federally legal. As the legal landscape and understanding about the differences in hemp derived cannabinoids unfolds, it will be increasingly important to distinguish “cannabis” & “THC” (with noted varying degrees of psychotropic effects and deficits in executive function) from CBD. Our future products and messaging will be very clear and precise in announcing those differences and we make no claims of any “cures” or “specific ailment” remedies.
 
The principal uncertainties are whether regulators will, at any time, attempt to treat CBD products similarly to THC products.
 
Federal Government Regulations
 
In 2014, the distinction between the use of Cannabis Sativa L. for medical, recreational, and industrial purposes was made via Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014, which cleared a legal path for industrial hemp to be grown in three limited circumstances, 1) by researchers at an institute of higher education, 2) by state departments of agriculture, or 3) by farmers participating in a research program permitted and overseen by a state department of agriculture.
 
In 2016 the DEA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a joint statement detailing the guidelines for growth of industrial hemp as part of state-sanctioned research programs. Those guidelines state that hemp can only be sold in states with pilot programs, plants and seeds can only cross state lines as part of permitted state research programs, and seeds can only be imported by individuals registered with the DEA. We believe the recent passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived CBD were classified as a Schedule I controlled substances, and so illegal under the CSA. With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under federal law and would thus face no legal protection under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.

The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3% THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 
FDA Regulation of Hemp Extracts
 
The United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over the counter drugs; (2) biologics including vaccines, blood & blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and (4) medical devices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics, and dental devices.
 
Regarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process requires a review that begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application, with follow on clinical studies and clinical trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA.
 
Aside from the FDA’s mandate to regulate drugs, the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. This means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA regulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements: (1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and (5) daily use information.
 
The FDA has not approved cannabis, marijuana, hemp, or derivatives as a safe and effective drug for any indication. As of the date of this filing, we have not, and do not intend to file an IND with the FDA, concerning any of our proposed products that contain CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis delivered in the State of California. Further, our proposed products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp are not marketed or sold using claims that their use is safe and effective treatment for any medical condition subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.
 
The FDA has concluded that products containing cannabis or industrial hemp derived CBD are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, respectively. The FDA’s position is that products containing cannabis, CBD or derivatives are Schedule 1 drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, and so are illegal. Our planned products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis delivered in other States are not marketed or sold as dietary supplements. However, at some indeterminate future time, the FDA may choose to change its position concerning generally cannabis and products containing hemp derived CBD and may choose to enact regulations that are applicable to such products. In this event, our proposed. industrial hemp-based products containing CBD and cannabis may be subject to regulation (See Risk Factors).
 
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management, and workplace health and safety. In addition, certain of our proposed products are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and comparable state regulatory agencies. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses.”
