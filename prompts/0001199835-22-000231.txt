ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
COMPANY HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2001, under the name Altus Explorations Inc. (Altus). The company was engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties for the years 2001 to 2009. The company was not able to secure sufficient financing to act on oil and gas investment opportunities as they were identified.
 
On October 1, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with UWD Unitas World Development Inc. (UWD), a privately held Canadian incorporated company. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued 80,000,000 shares of common stock for the acquisition 100% of the issued shares of Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc (CTTA). On November 4, 2010, Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. (CTTA) was a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent Company (the parent Company subsequently changed its name to Earth Life Sciences Inc. on June 2, 2014) and increased the authorized share capital from 40,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and then further from 250,000,000 to 450,000,000.
 
The Company operations consisted of the training of law enforcement, security, investigation and protection for officers and individuals. The following table outlines sales and net losses for the years starting in 2010 to 2015.
 

 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 
-------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+-------------
Sales | $ 10,178 | $ 15,613 | $ 50,309 | $ 80,372 | $ 66,504 | $ 59,053 
Net loss | 56,345 | 208,419 | 166,130 | 73,601 | 5,580 | 197 

 
As at December 31, 2015, the Company disinvested and discontinued the operations of subsidiary company, CTTA, based on poor earnings and potential future losses. Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were shown as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
 
On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an option agreement with Song Bo, a private mineral holder, to earn a 100% beneficial interest in certain mineral concessions known as the White Channel mineral claims (the Property). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement the Company issued 225,000,000 restricted shares and agreed to pay the sum of $180,000 payable in instalments of $30,000 on the 15th of every month commencing July 15, 2015 through December 15, 2015. In addition, the Company was to pay a further $50,000 on each anniversary of the Agreement for a period of four years commencing June 19, 2016, through June 19, 2019. The fair value of the issuance of the restricted shares was calculated to be $6,750,000. The Company examined the property in 2015 to 2017. In conjunction with the testing of the silica, it is important to note that a paved highway crossed a portion of the property connecting to a railway hub less than 40 forty miles away. The Company spent considerable time on trying to develop a partnership or joint venture relationship to mine, clean, bag and ship a silica product to the railway hub. The economics of any mining operation in the end had to show a good and positive return. The 225 million shares were retrieved and returned to treasury in February 2020.
  

On December 4, 2018, the authorized share capital was increased to 500,000,000 common shares. On October 8, 2020, the authorized share capital was increased to 1,000,000,000 common shares.
 
The Company in 2018 and 2019 considered entry into the marijuana business, contracted out a professionally written business plan, but in the final analysis decided this business was too risky and disengaged without making any formal arrangements.
 
INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SOFTWARE
 
In June of 2019, the Company started negotiations with a group of software developers with partners in USA, Canada, Asia, and Europe (Software Group). The Software Group has developed, sold, and is currently providing support services for products they have developed. Over the next six months the parties discussed a software product to provide mileage based loyalty systems for public transportation. On January 6, 2020, the parties signed a definitive agreement.

Out of the capital expenditures of $21 billion, the total for Communication Information Systems was $2,151,044,289.
 
The public transportation system in the US is a large industry. It was our contention that industry is seeking increased ridership by various means. We intend to offer the industry, a timely and current software, to assist the industry in reaching out to their ridership, and also meet other information demands.
 
The Company built its own database and compiled information on over 600 companies in the US. The purpose was to assess various entities as to their anticipated interest and/or enthusiasm for our transportation software. The Company may also reach out to foreign companies to test its software and potential use.
 
The Software
 
The Software was designed by the Software Group. The purpose of software is to identify what loyalty rewards and incentives should be given to whom and when to entice maximum-efficiency usage of public transportation based on unique rider behavior. The term maximum efficiency is a strategy such as return on investment (ROI); increase of ridership, decongestion analysis, interruption of service compensation, congestion management, and prediction analysis of ridership usage patterns. The delivery of the software can be directed to various rider groups by way of apps (an application, especially as downloaded by a user to a mobile device), via contactless smart cards or multi-tenant platforms. System can be implemented as a multi-tenant SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. Transit companies will be able to integrate platforms into their workflow and systems using APIs (application programming interface). The future is with smart transportation technology.
  

The Software Group own and were willing to lease their proprietary AI (Artificial Intelligence) software to the Company on an as-needed basis. Their AI software had passed rigorous model testing with several patents having been applied for. AI is simply software that can test certain algorithms and large amounts of data to hopefully give data patterns some significance, heuristics and/or importance.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 32 million common shares to the Software Group and upon receiving a working version of the software and necessary support documentation, the Company will deliver 125 million shares after testing, acceptance, and license transfer of the software. Further deliveries of 100 million shares will be based on gross sales of $1 million being reached in a consecutive twelve-month period within 3 years a further 100 million shares after gross sales of $5 million being reached in a consecutive twelve-month period within 5 years. All shares issued are restricted.
 
Effect of Covid-19 on operations of the Company.
 
The Company had developed a plan of action to become engaged in the public transportation industry, but the impact of Covid-19 completely decimated public transportation. Ridership numbers fell dramatically; the industry withdrew. While we still have an association with the Software Group, our attention is focused elsewhere.
 
INVESTMENT IN ONLINE ORDERING AND OFFLINE SERVICES  
 
The Company entered into and completed an agreement on September 24, 2021 with Viva Health HK Ltd. (Viva) to provide services through the mode of online ordering and offline service (O2O), the services being a service brand platform, aimed at the health care industry, and providing a full range of services in the United States, and particularly for aging Asian families.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 425 million common shares (Shares) to an escrow agent and upon receiving a satisfactory minimum viable product version and a Beta version completed and demonstrated with necessary support documentation, the Escrow Agent will transfer the Shares to Viva. A further issuance of 750 million shares will be issued upon the O2O website going fully live and operational. All shares being issued are restricted.
