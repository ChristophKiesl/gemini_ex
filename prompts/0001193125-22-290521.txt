 Diagnostics Segment 
 Products and Markets 
 Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic early in 2020, our largest source of net revenues was clinical diagnostic products, historically representing approximately two-thirds of our consolidated net revenues. However, primarily due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the growth in our Life Science segment, our Diagnostics segment provided 47% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2022, following 40% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2021. 
 Our clinical diagnostic products provide accuracy, simplicity and speed; enable early diagnosis and treatment of acute medical conditions; and provide for better patient outcomes at reduced costs. We target diagnostics for disease states that: (i) are conditions where rapid diagnosis impacts patient outcomes; (ii) have opportunistic demographic and disease profiles; (iii) are underserved by current diagnostic products; and/or (iv) have difficult sample handling requirements (e.g., stool). This approach has allowed us to establish meaningful market share in our target disease states, gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, and tests for elevated lead levels in blood. 
 Our product portfolio includes approximately 200 diagnostic tests and transport media, and is marketed to acute care hospitals, reference laboratories, outpatient clinics and physician office laboratories in over 70 countries around the world. Our testing platforms include: Real-time PCR Amplification (Revogene brand); Isothermal DNA Amplification (Alethia brand); Lateral Flow Immunoassay using fluorescent chemistry (Curian brand); Rapid Immunoassay (ImmunoCard and ImmunoCard STAT! brands); Enzyme-linked Immunoassay (PREMIER brand); Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (LeadCare brands); and urea breath testing for H. pylori (BreathID and BreathTek brands).
Our diagnostic assay research and development programs are focused on menu expansion for our Curian and Revogene instrument platforms, with disease targets in the gastrointestinal and respiratory areas, as well as next generation blood-chemistry testing. Currently pending clearance at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is a 510(k) application for our Curian EHEC Shiga Toxin assay. Our current new product development pipeline includes gastrointestinal and respiratory multi-plex assays on our Revogene instrument platform, and C. difficile combo common antigen and Toxins A and B, on our Curian instrument platform. In addition, we have other assays on both platforms moving through our upstream marketing assessment processes that are expected to add to the development pipeline. For our BreathID platform, we are actively looking at the feasibility of combining Urea and Citrica into a single sachet or pouch. We are also pursuing opportunities to complement our internal research and development programs by securing rights to finished diagnostics tests that we can immediately commercialize. 
The April 2020 acquisition of Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. (“Exalenz”) and the BreathID system, along with the July 2021 acquisition of the BreathTek business, strengthened our position in H. pylori testing, as these products provide an alternative testing approach versus stool antigen testing.
Market Trends 
 Despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the intense focus on SARS-CoV-2 testing, we believe the global market for infectious disease tests continues to expand as new disease states are identified, new therapies become available, and worldwide standards of living and access to health care improve. There is a continuing shift from conventional testing to more technologically advanced testing, which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in minutes or hours. 
 The growing global pressures to contain total health care costs have accelerated the increased use of diagnostic testing. Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”) in our U.S. market have the goal of increasing the efficiency of health care delivery, reducing spending and improving clinical outcomes. We believe our product portfolio positions us competitively with IDNs and health care systems that are transitioning from fee-for-service compensation models to value-based reimbursement. 
 
- 6 - 


 We also continue to see aggregation of buying power in our U.S. market via multi-hospital group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) and IDNs, consolidation among reference laboratories, hospital laboratories being operated by large reference laboratories, and acquisition of physician practices by hospitals, health systems and for-profit specialty health care companies. 
 Cost containment pressures have also affected health care systems outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, where the health care systems are generally government-run. The level of government budget deficits can have an adverse effect on the amount of government health care spend. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Our Diagnostics segment relies on direct sales personnel and independent distribution networks. We have a direct sales force in two countries, covering the United States (“U.S.”) and certain major markets in the EMEA region (i.e., in Europe, the Middle East and Africa). We also use independent distributors either in a complementary manner with our direct sales force (e.g., the U.S.) or solely to supply our products to end-users. We have two independent distribution customers and a reference laboratory customer that together comprised 29% of Diagnostics segment net revenues in fiscal 2022, with each contributing between 8% and 11% of the Diagnostics segment’s net revenues. 
Competition 
 Our major competitors in molecular diagnostics are Cepheid (a Danaher business) and Becton Dickinson, both of which have systems with multiple-assay menus. We also face competition in molecular diagnostics, but to a lesser degree, from companies such as Abbott (former Alere business) and QuidelOrtho. In recent years, companies such as bioMerieux have captured market share in our gastrointestinal category via its BioFire multi-plex panel tests. However, since their introduction to the market, payors have raised concerns over reimbursement levels relative to clinical utility, particularly for panels with 12 or more targets. Our major competitors in rapid immunoassay diagnostics are primarily Abbott (former Alere business) and QuidelOrtho. 
 For blood lead testing, we believe we have the only FDA-cleared, CLIA-waived point-of-care test available commercially. Other blood lead testing systems in use, marketed by our competitors, include Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, which requires a highly skilled technician and larger laboratory space to operate, in addition to not being portable or suitable for point-of-care use. 
 Research and Development 
 Our Diagnostics segment’s research and development personnel are organized into three pre-clinical teams: immunoassay, PCR-based molecular and blood-chemistry. We have a separate team responsible for execution of clinical trials across all three pre-clinical programs. Our research and development activities are focused on new product and new technology development, new applications for our existing technologies, and improvements to existing products, including assay-menu expansion. Research and development efforts may occur in-house or with collaborative partners. We believe that new product development is a key source for sustaining revenue growth. The products within our Revogene and Alethia molecular platforms, H. pylori product family and blood lead testing family were developed in-house.Manufacturing 
 Our diagnostics products are manufactured at four principal sites in Billerica, Massachusetts (blood-chemistry); Cincinnati, Ohio (immunoassays and molecular tests); Modi’in, Israel, (urea breath tests for H. pylori); and Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (molecular tests). Our immunoassay and molecular assay products require the production of highly specialized reagents, primers and enzymes, and our BreathID and BreathTek products require the production of urea in pharmaceutical-grade form. We produce the vast majority of our own immunoassay requirements. Reagents, primers and enzymes for our Revogene molecular assay products, primers for our Alethia molecular assay products, and urea for our BreathID and BreathTek systems are purchased from outside vendors. Our blood lead testing products require the production of electrical chemical sensors, which we manufacture using critical raw materials purchased from outside vendors.

 Intellectual Property, Patents and Licenses 
 We own or license U.S. and foreign patents, most of which are for select products manufactured by our Diagnostics segment. These patents are used in our manufacturing processes for select products (e.g., method patents) or may relate to the design of the test device technology format (e.g., design patents). In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our production and manufacturing technologies and processes. Our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements designed to protect our proprietary products. 
 The patents applicable to our Alethia products, which represented 3%, 4% and 7% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were licensed from a third party, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., under a non-exclusive license agreement, with the last remaining U.S. patent having expired during the year ended September 30, 2022. 
 The patents for the Revogene platform and related products acquired as part of the GenePOC business are either wholly owned or licensed from two third parties, Laval University and The Regents of California, under an exclusive license agreement. These patents are issued in the U.S., European Union (“EU”) and other countries. The term of our exclusive license agreement and the related patents currently runs through June 15, 2034, after which we will be free to practice the patents without any restriction or royalty obligation. In September 2021, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted to Meridian Bioscience Canada, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary) and Laval University a patent for our current Revogene test device and its microfluidic use in our Revogene instrument. 
 The patents for the BreathID system and related urea breath test for H. pylori are either wholly owned or licensed from a third party, Oridion Medical 1987 Ltd., under an exclusive, royalty free, license agreement. The licensed and wholly owned patents are issued in the U.S., EU, Israel, Japan, Australia and China. The wholly owned patents have varying expiration dates, with the last being in 2033. 
The patents for our stool antigen H. pylori products, owned by us and which represented approximately 5%, 7% and 9% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. As a result, competition with respect to our stool antigen H. pylori products has increased, adversely impacting our selling prices for these products, and/or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us. To mitigate certain of the pricing and volume pressures we face within the gastrointestinal product category, we have: (i) operated under a strategic collaboration agreement with DiaSorin to sell H. pylori tests; (ii) adjusted selling prices to secure volume; and (iii) upon FDA clearance in March 2020, launched Curian HpSA, our first assay on the Curian platform, which we expect will help protect our existing customer base using lateral flow tests. We also expect the BreathID and BreathTek products to mitigate competitive pressures, as these products provide an alternative to stool antigen testing. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any strategy or that any strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and/or liquidity, including net revenues and gross profit. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA as “devices” pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes (i.e., Class I, II or III). While exempt Class I and Class II products do not require FDA review, non-exempt Class I and Class II devices are “cleared” for marketing (i.e., these products require FDA review prior to marketing clearance). Class III devices generally must receive “pre-market approval” (“PMA”) from the FDA as to safety and effectiveness. Our diagnostics manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. See “Lead Testing Matters” beginning on page 32 within MD&A for discussion regarding the FDA’s inspection of our Billerica facility. 
 Each of the diagnostic products currently marketed by Meridian in the U.S. has been cleared, approved or authorized for use by the FDA or are exempt from such requirements. The majority of such products have been cleared by the FDA pursuant to its 510(k) premarket review process, whereas our BreathTek product has been approved under the FDA’s PMA process. In the case of our Revogene SARS-CoV-2 test, it has not been FDA cleared or approved but rather has been authorized by the FDA for emergency use under its Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) process, noting that there will likely be modifications to the regulatory requirements related to these tests in the near future when the EUA is revoked. We believe that most products under development will be classified as Class I or II medical devices and, in the case of most of our Class I and all Class II devices, will be eligible for 510(k) clearance; however, we can make no assurances in this regard. Our urea breath test for H. pylori on the BreathID system was cleared as a Class I medical device since the urea drug component was approved by the FDA separately via the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process. Our urea breath test for H. pylori on the BreathTek system was approved by the FDA via the PMA process in 2012. Following receipt of EUA on November 9, 2021 for our original SARS-CoV-2 test, our Omicron variant enhanced SARS-CoV-2 test on the Revogene platform was submitted to the FDA under its EUA program on March 29, 2022, with EUA being granted on July 27, 2022.

 Sales of our diagnostic products in foreign countries are subject to foreign government regulation, which is similar to that of the FDA. Our Diagnostics segment facilities are certified to ISO 13485. 
 Following a five-year transition period, sales of our diagnostic products in the EU are subject to new regulations under the In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation of 2017 (“IVDR”) beginning in May 2022. IVDR replaces the previous IVD Regulation (98/79/EC). In October 2021, the European Commission submitted a proposal to the European Parliament that would move back the May 2022 implementation date for diagnostic tests that are currently CE Marked to dates ranging from May 2022 (for Class A products) to May 2027 (for Class B products), depending on the risk classification of the diagnostic test. We have completed an assessment of needed remediation activities to comply with IVDR and also determined that several products will not be sellable under IVDR. The net revenues associated with these products are not expected to be material. New diagnostic products launched after May 2022 are required to comply with IVDR. 
 Life Science Segment 
 Products and Markets 
 Our Life Science segment develops, manufactures, sells and distributes bulk antigens, antibodies, immunoassay blocking reagents, specialized PCR master mixes, isothermal reagents, enzymes, nucleotides, and bioresearch reagents used predominantly by in vitro device (“IVD”) manufacturing companies, and to a lesser degree, by researchers and non-human clinical customers such as veterinary, food and environmental. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for our Life Science segment to showcase the breadth of its reagent products across not only SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms (molecular, rapid antigen and serology), but also RNA and DNA based molecular tests for nearly any infectious disease. For fiscal 2022, approximately 87% of Life Science segment net revenues were generated from the industrial market, defined as IVD manufacturers. Further, as it relates to our Life Science segment net revenues, a significant number of our Life Science segment customers now use our molecular reagents in multiple tests, including non-COVID-19 related tests, therefore making it increasingly difficult to accurately estimate the portion of molecular reagent sales related specifically to COVID-19. As a result, we are no longer reporting the portion of Life Science segment net revenues related to COVID-19. Such net revenues were identified and reported throughout fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, totaling approximately $111,900 and $71,500, respectively. We engage direct sales teams in the U.S., the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), France, Germany, China and Australia. During fiscal 2022, 28% of net revenues for this segment were from two IVD manufacturing customers. 
 Our Life Science segment products are marketed to IVD manufacturing customers as a source of raw materials for their human clinical diagnostics tests, or as an outsourced step in their manufacturing processes. Independent distributors market our molecular biology products to academic/research customers. Our products are used in detecting DNA and RNA in human, animal, plant and environmental applications. 
 Market Trends 
 Major IVD manufacturing customers often have global footprints, where we are supplying reagents to specific manufacturing sites around the world. IVD manufacturers in specific countries of the Asia-Pacific region (e.g., China) are increasing their efforts in the development and manufacturing of infectious disease tests. We intend to use the breadth of our product portfolio, particularly molecular reagents, to continue to increase the penetration of our products in IVD manufacturing customers’ tests. 
Competition 
 The market for bulk biomedical reagents is highly competitive with respect to product quality, price, customer service and reputation. Our competitors, such as Thermo Fisher, often have greater financial, research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing resources. Customers also may choose to manufacture their biomedical reagents in-house rather than purchase from us.

 Research and Development 
 Our research and development activities for the Life Science segment focus on molecular reagents for use in PCR and isothermal chemistries in detecting both DNA and RNA. Our new product development programs are progressing through sample-specific (e.g., blood, saliva, urine, stool, and plant) mixes in both air-dryable and lyophilization-ready forms, and isothermal reagents in both air-dryable and lyophilization-ready forms. We also have enzyme development programs that meet the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals regulation. See “Operating Expenses” section on page 36 within MD&A. Additionally, through our recent EUPROTEIN, Inc. (“EUPROTEIN”) and Estel Biosciences, Inc. (“Estel”) transactions in April 2022 and October 2022, respectively, we have expanded our immunological research and development capabilities. See the following notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions: (i) Note 4, “Business Combinations” for EUPROTEIN, and Note 18, “Subsequent Event” for Estel. 
 Manufacturing and Government Regulation 
 Our Life Science segment facilities are ISO 13485 certified, and where appropriate, our Life Science segment facilities comply with Regulation EC 1069. 
 International Markets 
 International markets are an important source of net revenues and future growth opportunities for both of our reportable segments. For both reportable segments combined, net revenues from customers located outside of the U.S. and its territories approximated $170,000 or 51% of consolidated 2022 net revenues, $173,000 or 55% of consolidated 2021 net revenues, and $122,000 or 48% of consolidated 2020 net revenues. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021 and 2022, a significantly higher percentage of our Life Science segment’s net revenues have been generated from international markets, and we expect to continue to look to key European and Asian markets as a source of revenue growth. For the Life Science segment, we also continue to focus resources on IVD manufacturing customers in China, India, Japan and Korea. To date, we have not experienced any adverse effects from the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, but we cannot be sure that we will not experience any adverse effects in the future. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 had an approximate $5,200 unfavorable impact on consolidated 2022 net revenues; $1,700 within the Diagnostics segment and $3,500 within the Life Science segment. This compares to year-to-year currency exchange rates having an approximate $9,200 favorable impact on consolidated net revenues in 2021; $1,300 within the Diagnostics segment and $7,900 within the Life Science segment. In fiscal 2020, the unfavorable effect on net revenues totaled $1,250; $150 within the Diagnostics segment and $1,100 within the Life Science segment. 
 Environmental 
 We are in compliance with applicable portions of the federal and state hazardous waste regulations and have never been a party to any environmental proceeding. 
 Human Capital 
 As of September 30, 2022, our Diagnostics segment had approximately 515 employees in eight countries, our Life Science segment had approximately 210 employees in six countries, and Corporate and Shared Services had approximately 45 employees, all in the U.S. Approximately 57% of our employees are women. In addition, of our U.S. based employees, which represents approximately 65% of our total worldwide workforce, approximately 25% are ethnically diverse. 
 Below is additional demographic information about our current employee base as of September 30, 2022.

 We believe that developing a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture is critical to continuing to attract and retain the top talent necessary to deliver on our growth strategy. As such, we continue to invest in the creation of a work environment where our employees can feel inspired to deliver their workplace best every day. We continue to expand our Human Resources Information System (“HRIS”) and other systems to track key human capital metrics, including workforce demographics, diversity, turnover, engagement, and training data. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 In 2020, we initiated the “One Meridian Inclusion Diversity and Equity Team,” which is comprised of a group of employees around the world and led by Dr. Lourdes Weltzien, Executive Vice President, Life Science, and Melissa McCarey, Vice President, Global Human Resources. Consistent with its mission statement, this team is providing topical programs throughout the year, in an effort to promote awareness so we can encourage and support an environment in which all employees feel included and empowered to achieve their best. 
Compensation and Benefits 
 We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees globally. Our compensation packages include market-competitive pay, cash bonuses, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off, and family leave, among others, depending upon locale. We are focused on pay equity globally and are striving to close the gap in pay among similar roles and responsibilities in certain locations within our organization, after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as performance, time at grade level, and tenure. We intend to conduct market surveys every two years to assess market compensation levels from a total compensation perspective. We also continue to advance transparency in our pay and representation data by complying with all applicable statutory filing requirements. 
Communication and Engagement 
 We strongly believe that Meridian’s success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: (i) One Meridian Company-wide intranet; (ii) quarterly CEO update videos; (iii) open forums or town hall meetings with executives; (iv) regular ongoing update communications; and (v) employee engagement surveys. 
Health, Wellness and Safety 
 We are committed to the safety of our employees and communities, and safety in our operations, our product development activities and our supplier partnerships. Our ultimate goal is to achieve zero serious injuries through continued investment in, and focus on, our core safety programs and injury-reduction initiatives. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness tools.
