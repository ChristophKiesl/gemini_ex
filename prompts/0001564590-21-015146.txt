Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of highly differentiated immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients. We leverage our deep understanding of the tumor microenvironment and immunosuppressive pathways to design novel product candidates with an aim to improve the clinical benefit of oncology therapies. Our innovative pipeline includes two clinical-stage programs targeting novel, validated immuno-oncology pathways designed to build on prior learnings in the field to have differentiated pharmacological and clinical profiles. Our most advanced product candidate, inupadenant, formerly referred to as EOS-850, is designed as a highly selective small molecule antagonist of the adenosine A2a receptor, or A2AR, in the adenosine pathway, a key driver of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment across a broad range of tumors. We are investigating inupadenant in an open-label multi-arm Phase 1/2a clinical trial in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors and in the dose escalation portion of the trial, it  has shown encouraging preliminary single-agent activity . In addition to the single-agent cohort, we commenced dosing in the second cohort evaluating inupadenant in combination with pembrolizumab in the third quarter of 2020. We expect to report additional data from monotherapy expansion cohorts later in 2021. Our lead antibody product candidate, EOS-448, is an antagonist of TIGIT, or T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, an immune checkpoint with multiple mechanisms of action leading to immunosuppression. EOS-448 was also selected to engage the Fc gamma receptor, or FcγR, to activate dendritic cells and macrophages and to promote antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, activity. In 2020, we enrolled an open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448 in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors and will report initial safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamic data at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting in April of 2021. We are using our expertise in tumor immunology to select additional targets for other novel, differentiated programs. We continue to progress research programs focused on additional targets that complement our A2AR and TIGIT programs.  We are optimizing our screening and selection process to identify potential candidates and expect to nominate an additional product candidate for Investigational New Drug, or IND, enabling studies before the end of 2021. We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize all of our product candidates.
 We are developing inupadenant to inhibit the adenosine pathway by specifically targeting A2AR, which is the primary adenosine receptor on immune cells with high affinity for adenosine. A2AR is expressed in a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies with high unmet medical need. We chose to directly and selectively inhibit A2AR, a target with the potential to alleviate immunosuppression in multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies and to minimize off-target effects. As elevated levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment are known to be immunosuppressive, we also designed inupadenant as an insurmountable antagonist to remain potent at high adenosine concentrations and maintain continuous target coverage. With this profile, we believe that inupadenant has the potential for enhanced antitumor activity as compared to other A2AR antagonists currently in clinical development. In our preclinical studies, we have shown that inupadenant inhibited adenosine pathway-mediated immunosuppression and led to both T cell activation and antitumor activity, when dosed either as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, or CPIs, or chemotherapy. We have also shown in preclinical studies that dosing of inupadenant in combination with a CPI resulted in the rejection of tumors after reintroduction without further treatment, suggesting the potential for a durable immune memory response. 
 In the dose escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant in 21 heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors, we observed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit, with seven patients achieving at least stable disease. Of these seven patients, as of July 7, 2020, two have exhibited confirmed partial responses, one with CPI-refractory metastatic melanoma and one with heavily pretreated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. The antitumor activity observed in the dose escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial is considered exploratory and no statistical analysis of the results from this portion of the trial is planned. Inupadenant has been reported to be generally well-tolerated, and as of July 7, 2020, with seven of 33 patients remaining on-study, we had observed no dose-limiting toxicity and one possibly drug-related serious adverse event of pericardial effusion. Based on the results, we plan to continue development of inupadenant both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, a CPI approved for use in a variety of cancers, and with other standard cancer therapies. We also plan to further evaluate activity in the monotherapy 
 1

setting to identify relevant biomarkers for patient selection. We expect to update data from the dose escalation and monotherapy expansion of this Phase 1/2a clinical trial later in 2021.
EOS-448 is an anti-TIGIT human immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, antibody that we are developing to inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of TIGIT. TIGIT is a cell surface receptor expressed on multiple immune cells, including CD8+T cells, natural killer, or NK, cells, and T regulatory cells, or Tregs, a cell population that inhibits the immune response and, in the context of cancer, promotes tumor growth by inhibiting the activation and proliferation of effector T cells and NK cells. TIGIT has also been shown to be a mediator of resistance to existing CPIs, including anti-PD-1 therapies. We have designed EOS-448 to have a high affinity for TIGIT and also to actively engage FcγR. We have shown in preclinical studies using a mouse anti-TIGIT antibody that engagement of FcγR was an important mediator of antitumor activity in vivo. Engagement of FcγR by EOS-448 results in the activation of a number of immune cells, including NK cells, macrophages and other effector cells, promoting inflammation and their cell killing function. Through engagement of FcγR and activation of ADCC, EOS-448 is designed to activate dendritic cells and macrophages and to deplete Tregs and exhausted T cells, which are known to express high levels of TIGIT, within the tumor microenvironment. In our preclinical studies, we have also shown that EOS-448 has high binding to TIGIT and, compared to a number of clinical-stage anti-TIGIT antibody equivalents, generated high levels of immune cell activation in an IL-2 promoter-dependent functional assay. 
 Our preclinical data suggest that EOS-448 has the potential to deliver robust antitumor activity and could be complementary to and used in combination with other cancer therapies such as CPIs and chemotherapy. Our preclinical data also suggest that EOS-448 is active in combination with inupadenant and chemotherapy, thus creating the potential for intra-portfolio synergies. In animal models and ex vivo experiments in patient-derived cells, we have shown that EOS-448 promoted the killing of immunosuppressive tumor-infiltrating Tregs. TIGIT is also expressed on tumor cells in certain hematological malignancies. Based on the high expression of TIGIT in multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies, we believe there is significant potential for EOS-448 in clinical applications. We recently completed the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448 as a monotherapy in patients with solid tumors with the primary goal of assessing its safety and tolerability and plan to present the initial data from this study at the AACR annual meeting. We plan to start multiple expansion cohorts in select indications with different combinations in mid-2021. 
 We began our research and development activities as a spin-off of Ludwig Cancer Research and have built significant expertise in designing novel cancer immunotherapies. Our internal research and development team has gained extensive knowledge in immuno-metabolism, characterization of the immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, pharmacology and translational medicine. We have also built discovery capabilities to develop both small molecules and antibodies with differentiated and optimized target product profiles for targets validated by a strong scientific rationale. We have been able to move from initiation of a discovery campaign to the identification of a preclinical candidate within 18 months for both inupadenant and EOS-448. Our expertise also allows us to integrate a biomarker-rich strategy into our clinical programs to measure the effect of a product candidate in patients, choose optimal combination agents and identify the patients most likely to benefit from treatment.

Strategy 
 Our vision is to transform the treatment of patients suffering from cancer by creating a broad portfolio of immuno-oncology therapies focused on novel targets in the tumor microenvironment. The key pillars of our strategy to achieve our vision include: 

• | Build upon the differentiated profile and encouraging preliminary single-agent activity of our lead product candidate, inupadenant, to advance it through clinical development and regulatory approval. We believe that inupadenant is a highly differentiated A2AR antagonist based on its specificity, potency and continuous target coverage. We believe that these characteristics may position inupadenant to deliver a better tolerability profile and more robust anti-tumor response than existing A2AR inhibitors in clinical development. We have observed preliminary single-agent activity in our Phase 1/2a clinical trial in advanced solid tumor patients and we intend to advance inupadenant both as a single agent and in combination with standard cancer treatments. We have initiated safety evaluation of inupadenant in combination with pembrolizumab and we plan start expansion cohorts in patients with melanoma who are resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy and in patients with CRPC who have not previously had immuno-oncology therapy. We have also started the safety evaluation of inupadenant and chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC. We plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss potential expedited regulatory strategies for inupadenant when appropriate.

• | Exploit the broad potential of TIGIT inhibition and advance EOS-448, our FcγR engaging anti-TIGIT antibody, through clinical development and regulatory approval. We believe the ability of EOS-448 to inhibit TIGIT and activate the FcγR on immune cells has the potential to deliver potent anti-tumor effects across a wide range of cancers. We have initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448 as a monotherapy for patients with solid tumors and we will report initial dose-escalation data at the AACR annual meeting in April 2021. We intend to evaluate EOS-448 in multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies in combination with existing therapies, including an IMID molecule, pembrolizumab, as well as with our A2AR antagonist, inupadenant. Our preclinical data suggest that EOS-448 is synergistic with other immuno-oncology agents and standard cancer therapies. We anticipate initiating new clinical trials of EOS-448 to evaluate combination regimens with expansions in specific indications in mid-2021. We plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss potential expedited regulatory strategies for EOS-448 when

• | Leverage our deep understanding of immune pathways and the tumor microenvironment to identify novel product candidates. Since our founding, we have established extensive knowledge in immuno-metabolism, characterization of the immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, pharmacology and translational medicine. We will continue to apply our expertise in understanding and targeting immunosuppressive cells and mechanisms of resistance within the tumor microenvironment to develop novel product candidates for the treatment of cancer. We plan to leverage our expertise to continue to select and pursue novel immuno-oncology product candidates targeting CPIs, tumor resistance mechanisms or immune system activation mechanisms, through both in-house research and in-licensing of complementary technologies. Building upon our work to date in the adenosine pathway, the CPI-mediated immunoregulatory pathways, we expect to advance an additional product candidate into IND-enabling studies in 2021 and to start another new preclinical program in 2021.

• | Maximize the value of our product candidates and pipeline by selectively entering into strategic collaborations. We hold worldwide development and commercial rights to our pipeline of immuno-oncology programs, and we intend to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in key geographies. In the future, we may selectively enter into strategic collaborations around certain targets, product candidates, disease areas or geographies if we believe these collaborations could maximize the value of our product candidates. We have and may in the future enter into collaborations that grant us access to certain compounds owned by third parties to enable therapeutic combinations that could enhance the clinical and commercial potential of our product candidates. For example, we have entered into a non-exclusive, clinical supply agreement with Merck & Co, or Merck, to evaluate inupadenant in combination with pembrolizumab.

• | Maintain a strong culture of innovation and build a leading immuno-oncology company putting patients first in everything we do. We will continue to apply our deep understanding of the tumor microenvironment to the discovery and development of novel immuno-oncology therapies that have the potential to provide breakthroughs for patients suffering from cancers who are currently underserved by available therapies. Core to this strategy is continuing to build a team and company culture, at our headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and our research and development center in Belgium, that prioritizes patients’ needs as we develop our lead programs and pipeline assets. Our vision, values, talent and strategy maximize our ability to operate at the forefront of innovations in immuno-oncology. We believe our presence in the United States and Belgium is a strategic advantage that enhances our ability to attract global talent and remain at the forefront of innovation in the field of immuno-oncology.

 The promise of immuno-oncology and the limitations of current immuno-oncology therapies
In recent years, the treatment of cancer has been reshaped by the promise of immuno-oncology therapies, particularly CPIs. Cancer cells have evolved the ability to evade recognition by the immune system, including by expressing immune checkpoints that inhibit the immune response. Immune checkpoints are proteins on certain immune cells that regulate the activation, often functioning as on-off switches, of effector cells. The first clinical validation of the manipulation of these receptors to reactivate and activate the immune system, since named immuno-oncology, came in 2010 when ipilimumab, an antibody targeting the immune checkpoint CTLA-4, demonstrated clinical benefit in metastatic melanoma patients. Since then, a number of immuno-oncology drugs have been approved and become a cornerstone of treatment for a wide range of cancers. CPIs, including ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and others, have now become a foundation of the immuno-oncology market, with an estimated $22 billion in sales in 2019. 
 CPIs work by binding to proteins on the surface of either immune or cancer cells that mediate inhibitory signals, thereby blocking the immunosuppressive interactions between the two. One of the most successful approved checkpoint inhibitors acts by preventing programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, on the tumor cell from interacting with its binding partner, the programmed death cell protein 1, or PD-1, which is found on the surface of cytotoxic T cells. Blocking this interaction can allow effector T cells to attack and destroy tumors. 
 While CPIs have provided significant therapeutic benefit for certain cancers, they are not efficacious in a majority of patients with cancer. For example, the reported efficacy of CPIs is limited in melanoma, a tumor known as having high immune cell infiltration, and only approximately 20% of patients with second-line melanoma had progression-free survival, or PFS, a year after the initiation of treatment with the anti-PD-1 CPI pembrolizumab (Keytruda), as illustrated in the figure below from the Keytruda package insert. The PFS observed to date in many 
 4

other solid tumor types has been more limited. Furthermore, the long-term benefit of these immunotherapy approaches, including CPIs, is limited because the majority of patients eventually become resistant or refractory to therapy. 
 

The understanding of the biology behind resistance to immunotherapy is evolving. Several different pathways have been identified that contribute to suppression of the immune system in the tumor microenvironment beyond those targeted by current CPIs. 
 Our drug discovery efforts are dedicated to a better understanding of these immune resistance pathways with the specific goal of generating novel product candidates that restore the immune response against cancer. We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates, inupadenant and EOS-448, each targeting a key mechanism that has the potential to inhibit an effective antitumor immune response: the adenosine pathway and the novel checkpoint TIGIT pathway, respectively. We believe that both product candidates have the potential to further increase patient responses to immunotherapy, including in patients resistant to currently approved CPIs. We are also using our deep understanding of these critical immune resistance pathways to identify new targets and generate additional product candidates that have the potential to work in synergy with inupadenant and EOS-448. 
 Inupadenant, our next generation immuno-oncology product candidate designed to counteract the adenosine immunosuppressive pathway 
 Inupadenant is a small molecule designed to block the immunosuppressive activity of adenosine by inhibiting the signaling of the A2AR on immune cells. In animal models, we showed antitumor activity of inupadenant both as a monotherapy and in combination with other standard cancer therapies, including CPIs. In the dose escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant as a monotherapy in heavily pretreated solid tumor patients, we observed clinical benefit in seven out of 21 patients, including two patients with confirmed partial responses as of June 10, 2020. Inupadenant has been reported to be generally well-tolerated, with four of 21 patients in the dose escalation cohort remaining on-study as of June 10, 2020, we have observed no dose-limiting toxicity or drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs. Based on these results, we plan to continue development of inupadenant both (i) as a monotherapy to further evaluate activity and to identify relevant biomarkers for patient selection and (ii) in combination with pembrolizumab and other current cancer therapies. 
 The immunosuppressive adenosine pathway 
 It is well established that the adenosine pathway is a key pathway that modulates immune responses in pathological conditions. ATP is normally found at very low levels extracellularly. Following cellular stress or cell 
 5

death, large amounts of ATP are released from cells, triggering inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP is rapidly converted to adenosine. Adenosine is immunosuppressive and acts to modulate the immune response and limit tissue destruction by activated immune cells. This balance is especially disturbed in the tumor microenvironment, where the combination of hypoxia and cancer cell death generates high concentrations of ATP. The hypoxic conditions in the tumor microenvironment at the same time induce the expression of CD39 and CD73, two enzymes that convert ATP into adenosine. In addition, there are other enzymes such as tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase, or TNAP, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase, or PAP, that contribute to the production of adenosine. The expression of these enzymes contributes to an increase in processing of ATP to adenosine, and the resulting high levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment suppress the activity of cytotoxic effector T cells that would otherwise kill tumor cells. 
 Adenosine A2A receptor and immune cell function 
 The Adenosine pathway offers multiple potential targets for drug programs, including the enzymes involved in adenosine production, the adenosine deaminase, the enzyme involved in adenosine degradation, and the adenosine receptors expressed on immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment. There are four known adenosine receptors: A1, A2A, A2B and A3. Of these, only A2AR and A2BR are believed to play a role in intra-tumoral immune suppression. A2AR has been shown to have an affinity for adenosine that is approximately 100-fold higher than A2BR. Furthermore, as illustrated in the figure below, A2AR is the primary adenosine receptor expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, monocytes and dendritic cells. To measure the adenosine receptors expression, we quantified messenger RNA, or mRNA, of all adenosine receptors in purified human immune cell populations in resting and stimulated conditions. T cells and NK cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-2, respectively. Monocytes and dendritic cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides, or LPS. 
 

We are focused on the direct target for adenosine, its receptor, and we chose A2AR as it is the most highly expressed in relevant immune cell populations and one of the receptors with high affinity for the ligand as opposed to targeting upstream enzymes that are involved in production of adenosine. We selected A2AR as the target for inupadenant because we believe it is a key actor that mediates the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine regardless of the source of adenosine production. 
 Validation of A2AR antagonist as immunomodulator 
 The major role played by A2AR in immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated in several preclinical studies published by other groups in peer-reviewed journals. In these studies, pharmacologic agents that inhibited A2AR were shown to induce antitumor activity. Additional experiments showed that the genetic knockout of A2AR in mice led to the rejection of multiple tumor types in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner, providing support for the hypothesis that A2AR could be a valid therapeutic target. The antitumor activity was further enhanced when the compounds were tested in combination with CPIs. 
 6

A2AR antagonists have previously been evaluated in clinical trials for central nervous system, or CNS, indications, and one of these agents, istradefylline, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. As the role of adenosine in tumor-mediated immunosuppression became clear, several companies set out to evaluate A2AR antagonists initially developed for use in CNS diseases in oncology settings. These first-generation compounds have shown initial signs of activity, but were in some cases associated with dose-limiting toxicity, possibly related to CNS effects. Furthermore, rolofylline, an A1R antagonist that was tested in a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with heart failure, was associated with an increase of stroke and seizure, underscoring that lack of selectivity for A2AR could present safety risks. Therefore, we have specifically designed inupadenant to target A2AR and not to cross the blood-brain barrier, which we believe will lead to an improved therapeutic index. 
 High adenosine concentrations prevent an effective anti-tumor immune response and play a role in resistance to current cancer therapies 
 While it has been accepted that adenosine levels are elevated in the tumor microenvironment, precise measurement of adenosine concentrations in tumors has been hindered by its short half-life. We set out to assess adenosine concentration in tumors using 10 different patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models to confirm the hypothesis that adenosine concentration is higher in tumors than in normal tissue. In these models, as illustrated in the figure below, the mean extracellular adenosine concentration in tumors was 10.66 µM, which is approximately 20-fold higher than adenosine levels measured in normal tissue. These data support our rationale for designing adenosine receptor antagonists to maintain potency at high adenosine concentrations for use as a cancer therapeutic. 
 

We believe the elevated levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment may be a modulator of resistance to current cancer therapies, including both CPIs and chemotherapy. High activity of soluble CD73 was associated with poor overall survival and PFS in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 CPI. An association between high adenosine blood concentrations and lack of response to nivolumab was shown in a clinical trial of renal cell cancer patients conducted by others. In this trial, patients who failed to respond to nivolumab had significantly higher blood adenosine levels than those who responded, both at baseline (158% higher) and at four weeks after initiation of treatment (138% higher). Patients with baseline adenosine levels in the 
 7

top quartile also had a significantly worse PFS. These data further support our belief that adenosine plays an important role in resistance to CPIs such as nivolumab. Additional data support a potential role in chemotherapy-induced resistance, as chemotherapy has been shown in some cases to increase the production of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment and some chemotherapeutics induce adenosine-mediated immunosuppression that may limit the efficacy of these therapies. 
 Given the important role of A2AR in mediating the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, we believe that a potent and selective antagonist of A2AR has the potential to restore antitumor immune response inhibited by adenosine and enhance the activity of other cancer therapies, including CPIs and chemotherapy. 
 Our solution: Inupadenant 
 Inupadenant is an A2AR antagonist that we engineered to specifically inhibit the activity of A2AR on immune cells at the high concentrations of adenosine found in the tumor microenvironment, in order to address the shortcomings of other A2AR antagonists currently in development. As illustrated in the figure below, hypoxia and cell necrosis in the tumor lead to the release of ATP, which is converted to adenosine in the tumor microenvironment. Adenosine exerts an immunosuppressive effect via activation of A2AR, thereby inhibiting the tumor-killing function of effector T cells. Inupadenant is designed to release the adenosine driven immunosuppression of T cells by antagonizing A2AR, thereby allowing T cells to kill their tumor targets. 
 

Differentiation of inupadenant 
 We believe inupadenant has three key characteristics that provide the molecule with a unique profile and potential advantages in clinical settings when compared to other A2AR antagonists currently in development: 
  
1. | High affinity for A2AR and insurmountable antagonism. We believe that the affinity and sustained binding of inupadenant to its target may allow it to maintain potency at high concentrations of adenosine, differentiating it from other A2AR antagonists in development. The ability of an A2AR antagonist to reduce the maximum effect of A2AR activation at any concentration of an agonist such as adenosine is a characteristic known as insurmountable antagonism. In our in vitro studies, we measured cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, to assess the potency of several A2AR antagonists. The activation of A2AR on the surface of primary human T cells leads to the production of cAMP, which makes it a relevant indicator for potency. In this functional assay, we tested competitor antagonists and, as illustrated in the figure below, we observed that at low adenosine concentrations, inupadenant was the most potent antagonist of the A2AR antagonists tested, and most notably, when compared to other antagonists developed by competitors, the potency of inupadenant was not reduced at the high adenosine concentrations typically found in the tumor microenvironment.

We further illustrated the potential advantage of inupadenant’s high potency and insurmountable antagonism for A2AR in mouse models. As illustrated in the figure below, we showed that administration of a single 3 mg/kg oral dose resulted in plasma levels of inupadenant that exceeded the half maximal inhibitory concentration, or IC50, for mouse A2AR for eight hours. However, even though inupadenant was cleared from circulation within hours, inhibition of A2AR cell signaling, as measured by the phosphorylation of a transcription factor CREB, or pCREB, was maintained for longer than 24 hours. This difference between the pharmacokinetics, or PK, meaning the change in drug concentration in circulation over time, and the pharmacodynamics, or PD, meaning the change in biological effect over time, suggests that inupadenant could provide a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect and sustained A2AR inhibition in patients.

2. | Inupadenant has higher selectivity for A2AR than other antagonists in clinical development. Because A2AR is the primary adenosine receptor on immune cells, we believe that the high specificity of inupadenant will enable it to have potent effects on immune cell function in solid tumors and hematological malignancies, while avoiding potential adverse effects that may be associated with inhibition of other subtypes of adenosine receptors with broader expression profiles. The table below summarizes data from our study showing the IC50 for inhibition of cAMP production in HEK cells overexpressing one of the four adenosine receptors, comparing inupadenant and models of three other adenosine receptor antagonists currently in development. Inupadenant was the most potent A2AR antagonist among other antagonists as demonstrated by the very low concentrations of drug required to give a 50% response in a functional assay. Higher concentrations were required to give the same effect on other adenosine receptors, further supporting the high selectivity of inupadenant.

3. | Inupadenant is designed not to cross the blood brain barrier. Unlike first generation A2AR antagonists, we designed inupadenant specifically to avoid penetration to the CNS through crossing of the blood-brain barrier. In preclinical models, inupadenant displayed less than 1% blood-brain barrier penetration and accordingly we believe it is designed to minimize the potential for adverse CNS effects.

 Antitumor activity in mouse models 
 We have evaluated the antitumor activity of inupadenant in multiple syngeneic mouse models, which are models in which the mouse maintains a complete immune system and therefore can be used to demonstrate the effect of an agent that works via immune activation. In some of these studies, we used a racemate of inupadenant. A racemate is a mixture of two molecules comprised of an identical atomic structure but in which atoms are arranged as mirror images of each other in three-dimensional space. inupadenant is a chemically pure form of inupadenant, and we believe the results from inupadenant are indicative of the activity of the form of inupadenant we are currently developing. In a B16F10 melanoma model, we showed that inupadenant administered as a monotherapy at a dose of 1 mg/kg once daily, significantly delayed tumor growth for over 20 days. 
 We also showed that inupadenant significantly enhanced the ability of a variety of anti-mouse CPIs to suppress tumor growth in multiple models. For example, as illustrated in the figure below, in a model of A20 reticulum cell tumors that express a high level of PD-L1, treatment with either anti-PD-L1 or inupadenant alone led to a modest reduction in tumor growth. However, the combination of anti-PD-L1 and inupadenant at two different concentrations led to significantly enhanced tumor suppression compared to either monotherapy, at both doses. At the highest combination dose, a statistically significant difference in the tumor response compared to vehicle was shown (p<0.001), and six of 10 mice had tumor regression at the time of treatment termination. P-value is a standard measure of statistical significance, and p-values of 0.05 or lower, reflecting a one-in-20 chance that the results occurred at random, are typically considered statistically significant.

We used another syngeneic tumor model, EMT6, to test the combination of inupadenant with an anti-CTLA4 CPI, as illustrated in the figure below. EMT6 is a breast tumor model that has been shown to be sensitive to anti-CTLA4 treatment. In this model, we showed that anti-CTLA4 antibody dosed as a monotherapy at days nine and 12 delayed tumor growth until approximately day 30. The addition of daily dosing with inupadenant from days eight through 36 led to complete tumor regression. Despite stopping treatment at day 36, we showed persistent complete responses through the last measurement point at 60 days. These results were statistically significant (p=0.016). 
 
Importantly, as illustrated in the figure below, in the same mouse model, we showed that treatment with the combination of inupadenant and anti-CTLA4 antibody resulted in generation of antigen-specific durable immune memory. In this experiment, mice in which EMT6 tumors had been eradicated, were resistant to the establishment of new EMT6 tumors that were injected on day 64, 28 days after suspension of all treatment, and this resistance lasted through day 98, the last measurement point. These mice were not protected from an unrelated colon carcinoma tumor, CT26, which readily grew in these mice in a manner similar to naïve mice. We believe the development of immune memory, or the ability of the immune system to be recalled into action against the same tumor, has important therapeutic implications that may enable long-term durable responses due to the ability to actively prevent reemergence of tumors.

Clinical development of inupadenant 
 We are conducting an open-label multi-arm Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant as a monotherapy in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies, as well as in combination with pembrolizumab and with chemotherapy. The goal of the dose escalation portion of the study is to assess safety and tolerability of inupadenant, with secondary analyses focused on PK, PD and overall response rate. The study will also include expansion cohorts in melanoma, CRPC and TNBC to evaluate the ORR.
 We have completed the monotherapy dose escalation portion of the clinical trial, enrolling 21 patients in five dose cohorts (20 mg and 40 mg once daily, or QD, and 40 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily, or BID). Patients were dosed every day with assessment cycles every 28 days through disease progression. Based on the results of this escalation cohort, we have selected the recommended Phase 2 dose for monotherapy of 80 mg BID. We are currently enrolling a monotherapy expansion cohort of up to 24 patients to further evaluate the safety, PK and PD at the recommended Phase 2 dose in a subset of solid tumor cancer indications that we believe are most likely to benefit from single-agent treatment, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, CRPC and endometrial cancer. We are also analyzing tumor samples from patients enrolled in our trials to help identify biomarkers that could be used to select patients that are most likely to respond in future trials. We plan to provide an update on these evaluations of inupadenant monotherapy later in 2021.
 We have begun to assess inupadenant in combinations with chemotherapy or with pembrolizumab starting in the third quarter of 2020, initially evaluating safety and tolerability of the combination regimens in patients with solid tumors before enrolling expansion arms in select indications such as CRPC, melanoma and TNBC. We selected these indications to evaluate inupadenant where there is a strong rationale for treatment with an A2AR antagonist based on expression of the receptor and adenosine-producing enzymes, evidence that the adenosine pathway plays a role in treatment resistance, and the presence of T cells in the tumor microenvironment. We have selected settings where current immunotherapies, including CPIs, have not had optimal outcomes, such as in (i) CRPC, for which CPIs have had limited benefit, (ii) melanoma patients who are resistant to treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies, and (iii) the 60% of patients with TNBC who are not eligible to receive standard-of-care atezolizumab, a CPI, in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for metastatic disease. The figure below illustrates the design of our ongoing open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant. The primary objective of this trial is to define the recommended Phase 2 dose and to characterize the safety and tolerability of inupadenant as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. The secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics of inupadenant and to assess the anti-tumor activity of inupadenant given alone or with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy.

Phase 1 clinical trial results 
 Preliminary evidence of clinical benefit of inupadenant monotherapy 
 We have observed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit, measured as complete or partial response or stable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1, for at least eight weeks in seven of the 21 heavily pre-treated patients with solid tumors as of March 1, 2020, as illustrated in the table below. RECIST 1.1 is a standard set of guidelines for assessing responses in solid tumors, with definitions for complete response (disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from baseline), stable disease (neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease), and progressive disease (at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from the smallest sum on study or the presence of new lesions). A complete or partial response is considered confirmed if the response criteria are met on a subsequent assessment. Clinical benefit was observed at a higher frequency in patients who received a BID regimen, however the antitumor activity results from dose escalation are considered exploratory and no statistical analysis of the results from this portion of the trial is planned. One patient with CPI-refractory metastatic melanoma and one patient with heavily pretreated metastatic CRPC have experienced confirmed partial responses and are continuing treatment with inupadenant. An additional two patients have achieved stable disease lasting over nine months. The figure below illustrates the current status of the dose escalation patients in our Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant as of June 10, 2020. 
 13



We observed a confirmed partial response in a patient with checkpoint blockade-resistant metastatic melanoma. This patient had metastatic disease that showed no benefit from pembrolizumab, radiotherapy or ipilimumab, before enrolling in the inupadenant clinical trial. Eight weeks after the last administration of a four-dose course of ipilimumab, this patient had evidence of disease progression with new lesions and began treatment with inupadenant 160 mg BID. At the first post-enrollment disease assessment seven weeks after the initiation of therapy, this patient showed stable disease, with a 26% reduction in target lesions, and the patient reported improved function of the affected arm. Sixteen weeks after treatment initiation, a 44% reduction in tumor size was observed, as shown in the figure below. As of July 7, 2020, this patient was continuing to receive inupadenant. This patient reported decreased swelling and noted improved mobility of his arm. 
 

A confirmed partial response was also observed in a patient with metastatic CRPC. Prior to the inupadenant trial, this patient had five previous rounds of therapy, including antiandrogen therapy and chemotherapy with docetaxel and cabazitaxel. After eight weeks of treatment with inupadenant 80 mg BID; tumor measurement showed stable disease with a small increase in the size of tumors and lymph nodes reported. Reduction in the size of target lesions of 40% and 49% were observed at 16 weeks and 30 weeks after initiation of inupadenant dosing, respectively, as illustrated in the figure below. The patient’s level of prostate-specific antigen, a tumor biomarker, also decreased from 2.03 ng/mL to 0.2 ng/mL while on treatment. This patient also reported reduced bone pain. As of July 7, 2020, dosing was continuing in this patient. 
 14


Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
 As illustrated in the left column of the figure below, we observed that the exposure of inupadenant was approximately dose proportional up to a dose of 80 mg BID. At a dose of 80 mg BID, the plasma concentration of inupadenant was continuously maintained over the IC50, which was approximately 6 ng/mL for pCREB inhibition in whole blood. At a higher dose of 160 mg BID, inupadenant was generally well tolerated, but the drug exposure was reduced and more variable, which we believe may be related to limited dissolution and absorption of the current formulation of inupadenant at this dose. At Cycle 2 Day 1, after 28 days of dosing, the exposure for all doses was similar to the first day of dosing, indicating that there is no accumulation or reduction in exposure at steady state dosing. 
 Pharmacodynamic assays showed target engagement and full inhibition of the pathway for all doses of inupadenant administered BID tested in blood cells exposed to CGS-21860, an agonist for A2AR. As illustrated in the middle column of the figure below, the effect of inupadenant on A2AR in patients’ CD8+ T cells, the intended target, was measured by assessing cAMP-dependent changes in activation of transcription related to A2AR inhibition. Inhibition of A2AR caused a reduction in levels of cAMP which in turn prevented CREB from being phosphorylated, indicated as pCREB. Furthermore, as shown in the right column of the figure below, we observed that administration of inupadenant restored the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNFα, an inflammatory cytokine that has multiple immunostimulatory effects. pCREB alters the production of multiple cytokines, including TNFα. On Cycle 1 Day 1, the first day of inupadenant dosing, we observed reductions in the levels of phosphorylated CREB and nearly full restoration of TNFα within two hours, the first time point measured. BID dosing at 40, 80 or 160 mg was able to maintain these effects for 24 hours on the first day of dosing. On Cycle 2 Day 1, after 28 days of dosing, inhibition of CREB phosphorylation and restoration of TNFα production were maintained. We observed that the effect of inupadenant on A2AR persisted longer than would be expected based on the concentration of inupadenant in the blood, which was consistent with our preclinical observations. 
 15


The 80 mg BID dose provided continuous inhibition of A2AR in the dose escalation portion of the trial and, accordingly, we have selected this regimen as the recommended dose of the current formulation for further study. We plan to introduce a new formulation of inupadenant that has shown improved dissolution properties and good absorption under high pH conditions in preclinical testing. We expect the new formulation to be available for a clinical bridging study in the first quarter of 2021, which is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2021. 
 Safety profile 
 As of July 7, 2020, we had completed enrollment of 21 patients in the dose finding portion of this open-label Phase 1 trial and 12 patients in the monotherapy expansion cohort. In the dose finding portion, inupadenant has been reported to be generally well-tolerated at all doses and we had observed no dose limiting toxicities and one possibly drug-related serious adverse event of pericardial effusion. Since the July 7, 2020 data cutoff, we have observed an additional serious adverse event that was considered a dose-limiting toxicity. As illustrated in the tables below, as of the previous interim analysis with a cut-off date of January 15, 2020, all of the reported drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were Grade 1 or 2. The most common drug-related TEAEs observed were fatigue, liver enzyme elevation, decreased appetite and diarrhea. Asymptomatic interstitial pneumonitis, which is considered an immune-related adverse event, was observed in one patient. 
 
Reported serious adverse events, or SAEs, which occurred in 15 of the 33 treated patients as of July 7, 2020, were pneumonitis, pericardial effusion, inflammation, abdominal pain, cerebrovascular accident, small intestinal obstruction, arthralgia, diarrhea, retroperitoneal hematoma, vomiting, urinary tract infection, sepsis, acute kidney injury, hypercalcemia, bone pain, cancer pain, pain in extremity, epilepsy, and pneumothorax. Of these, the pericardial effusion was considered to be possibly drug-related, and all of the remaining SAEs were considered 
 16

not drug-related. The SAEs of pneumonitis and pericardial effusion were experienced by a 55-year-old woman with endometroid adenocarcinoma of the endocervix. The event of grade 2 pneumonitis, which was ultimately ruled as unrelated to the study drug, was diagnosed nine weeks after initiating treatment and led to interruption of dosing with inupadenant. Four weeks after the dosing was interrupted, the subject was diagnosed with a moderate to severe pericardial effusion, ruled by the investigator to be possibly drug-related, and was admitted to intensive care and treated with steroids, with the patient expiring five days later due to acute right heart failure. The subject’s death due to acute right heart failure related to disease progression was not considered drug-related, and the lung findings that had been previously diagnosed as pneumonitis have been determined to be related to disease progression within the lungs. The pericardial effusion, which occurred approximately four weeks after treatment with inupadenant was discontinued, was considered possibly drug-related by the investigator.
 Upcoming clinical updates
 As of March 16, 2021, a total of 43 patients (including the 21 patients summarized above) have been enrolled in the monotherapy dose escalation and expansion and we expect to provide updated results later in 2021. We are also currently enrolling patients in the cohorts assessing inupadenant in combination with chemotherapy, in combination with pembrolizumab, and as monotherapy in CRPC.
 Potential broader opportunity for inupadenant 
 We anticipate that emerging data from our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial will help guide our initial choices of tumor indications to pursue with inupadenant. We will also be guided by our evaluation of the expression of A2AR and adenosine-producing enzymes, such as CD73, TNAP and PAP in various tumor types. 
 In our clinical trial, we are evaluating potential predictors of response and potential PD biomarkers in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples. These biomarkers include the expression of A2AR and adenosine-producing enzymes within the tumor, the presence of immune cells within the tumor and several tumor gene signatures, including an immune gene signature. We plan to use these data to assess the potential correlation between expression of these potential predictive markers and clinical response to inupadenant. We believe inupadenant has the potential to provide clinical benefit across many indications. In the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase X trial evaluating inupadenant in combination with pembrolizumab in melanoma and CRPC and in the fourth quarter of 2020 we initiated the evaluation of inupadenant in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in TNBC.
 EOS-448, a FcγR-engaging anti-TIGIT antibody 
 EOS-448 is an antibody specifically designed to target TIGIT, a receptor expressed on various immune cells, particularly tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs. Its main ligands play both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in regulating immune response and are highly expressed in tumors, where they have been shown to mediate immunosuppression. EOS-448 is designed to block TIGIT and restore activation of TILs and engage FcγR, leading to an antitumor immune response. In preclinical models, we have shown that our anti-TIGIT antibody inhibited tumor growth or caused tumor regression both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies, including anti-PD-1 antibodies. To date, EOS-448 has exhibited a favorable tolerability profile in a toxicology study in non-human primates. We are currently enrolling patients with refractory solid tumors in an open-label Phase 1/2a study of EOS-448 as a monotherapy and intend to initiate expansion cohorts to evaluate EOS-448 as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 and other standard cancer therapies. We believe that EOS-448 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients with a wide array of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. 
 The role of TIGIT in the tumor microenvironment 
 Current CPI agents restore an active effector T cell response in some patients, but many patients either do not respond or develop resistance during therapy. One key mechanism of resistance to these therapies is via the TIGIT checkpoint, which maintains suppression of effector T cells and NK cell in the tumor microenvironment and prevents an effective antitumor immune response. As illustrated in the figure below, TIGIT is expressed on immune cells and interacts with its ligands, CD155 and CD112, expressed by cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells. This interaction acts to inhibit the antitumor activity of effector T cells and NK cells. An anti-TIGIT antibody like EOS-448 is designed to disrupt the binding of TIGIT to its ligands, thereby enabling CD155 and CD112 to interact with the co-stimulatory receptor, CD226, which in turn stimulates the activity of effector T cells and NK 
 17

cells. The expression of TIGIT on TILs and of these ligands in a wide array of cancers has been shown to have the potential to create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. 
 
Validation of TIGIT as an antitumor target 
 TIGIT is a validated target that plays a known role in preventing an effective antitumor immune response. TIGIT expression has been observed to be higher on tumor-infiltrating immune cells than on circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, in patients with cancer, and TIGIT has been shown to be expressed on immune cells in various tumor types, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and NSCLC. As shown in the figure below, high levels of TIGIT mRNA have been detected in multiple hematological and solid tumor types. This mRNA data was derived from the publicly available Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas database. In addition, TIGIT’s natural binding ligands CD155 and CD112 are highly expressed on most solid tumors. Immunohistochemical staining of human tumor tissue samples have demonstrated that CD155 is highly expressed in solid tumors and CD226 expressing cells can be detected in a range of solid tumor types. These findings highlight the potential of anti-TIGIT drugs in numerous types of cancer. 
 
Early research on TIGIT showed that its inhibition enhanced the killing of tumor cells, and genetic knockout of TIGIT in mouse models was associated with increased cancer resistance. Several ex vivo and in vivo studies conducted by others have shown that blockade of TIGIT in the tumor microenvironment synergizes with other CPIs and results in the reversal of T cell exhaustion and leads to subsequent tumor rejection. 
 In our preclinical studies, we showed in a murine CT26 colon carcinoma model and in a syngeneic EMT6 breast carcinoma model that the inhibition of both TIGIT and PD-1 resulted in a reversal of tumor growth. In the CT26 model, we showed a complete response in seven of eight mice and the induction of a protective, antigen-specific memory response. 
 Given the important role of TIGIT in maintaining an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, we believe that a potent, high affinity anti-TIGIT antibody with the ability to engage FcγR would have the potential to restore the antitumor immune response and improve the activity of cancer therapies, including CPIs and chemotherapy. 
 18

Our solution, EOS-448, an FcγR-activating anti-TIGIT antibody 
 Our anti-TIGIT antibody, EOS-448, is a recombinant, fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human TIGIT that we selected for clinical development based on its favorable characteristics, including affinity, antagonist activity, cross-reactivity to TIGIT in non-human primates, functionality and suitability for development. 
 EOS-448 is designed to restore immune responses through multiple mechanisms. As illustrated in the figure below on the left, EOS-448 is designed to block the binding of CD155 and CD112 to TIGIT, which frees these ligands to bind to the stimulatory receptor, CD226, resulting in activation of immune cells leading to immune-mediated killing of tumor cells. This mechanism of action is relevant to TIGIT bearing NK cells. In T cells, TIGIT expression tends to correlate with exhaustion and so this mechanism of action may be more restricted to T cells with lower levels of TIGIT. In addition, as the antibody has been designed as a fully functional IgG1, EOS-448 can coat any cell expressing high levels of TIGIT and activate dendritic cells and macrophages leading to enhanced immune activation, as illustrated in the middle panel. Finally, this macrophage and NK cell activation can lead to killing of the cells expressing sufficiently high levels of TIGIT as shown in the right panel below. Tregs in the tumor microenvironment and exhausted T cells express high levels of TIGIT and so EOS-448 may induce the destruction of these cell populations, thereby relieving the immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment. 



We created equivalent versions of anti-TIGIT antibodies in development by others, based on sequences from the patents of Mereo, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Arcus and compared them to EOS-448 in preclinical assays. As shown in the figure below, compared to these antibodies, EOS-448 had high binding affinity for CD8+ T cells and broke the interaction between TIGIT and CD155 at low concentrations of the antibody. Affinity was not assessed on other immune cells that express TIGIT. EOS-448 also generated high levels of immune cell activation as determined using an IL-2 promoter-dependent functional assay. In our antibody screening studies, we have found that functional activity can be independent of affinity, and chose an antibody that was optimized for both. We believe these properties could translate into superior clinical benefit of EOS-448 as compared to other anti-TIGIT antibodies in development. 
 19




EOS-448 restored anti-tumor immunity via multiple mechanisms 
 Cytokines are key inflammatory mediators that can activate the immune response and are a marker of immune cell function. We have shown that EOS-448 restored the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, as shown in the figure below, in an ex vivo experiment using PBMCs isolated from a melanoma patient and activated in the presence of TIGIT ligand, when compared to a control antibody. 
 
Similar stimulatory activity was shown for other pro-inflammatory cytokines in ex vivo experiments using PBMCs or dissociated tumor cells from patient samples. In additional experiments, we have shown that EOS-448 led to increased expression of IL-2, IFNγ and TNFα by activated T cells in samples from patients with other solid tumor types. 
 Activation of the immune response was further supported by data from syngeneic mouse models. As EOS-448 does not recognize mouse TIGIT, we used a surrogate mouse anti-TIGIT antibody with properties similar to those of EOS-448. Strong antitumor activity of our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody was shown against pre-established CT26 tumors, both when it was dosed as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 CPI. In this experiment, our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody limited tumor growth as a monotherapy when compared to animals that did not receive treatment. In contrast, anti-PD-1 antibody, administered as monotherapy, did not demonstrate anti-tumor activity in this model. The combination of the anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies resulted in synergy and a robust antitumor response, with seven out of eight treated mice achieving a complete response, or CR, as shown in the figure below. 
 20



We believe the potential for synergistic activity between EOS-448 and other immuno-oncology agents extends beyond the combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, as similar effects were shown in our preclinical studies when our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody was evaluated in combination with antibodies in clinical development directed at other immune checkpoints, including 4-1BB, OX-40, GITR, and ICOS. Similarly, anti-tumor activity was observed when our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody was combined with chemotherapy and our A2AR antagonist, or A2ARi, as shown in the figure below. We believe that these findings suggest that EOS-448 may have therapeutic benefit in combination with standard cancer therapies, as well as with next-generation immuno-oncology agents, in multiple indications. 
 
21

FcγR binding is important for the activity of anti-TIGIT therapy 
 Other companies are developing anti-TIGIT antibodies with either high or low FcγR engagement, or binding, as shown in the table below.
 
 
High FcγR Engagement | Low FcγR Engagement | Unknown FcγR Engagement | Effector Function Enhanced lgG1
----------------------+------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------
EOS-448 | Domvanalimab (AB154) | IBI939 | SEA-TGT 
BGB-A1217 | ASP8374 (discontinued) | M6223 | AGEN1327 
vibostolimab (MK7684) | BMS-986207 | JS006 | 
tiragolumab | COM902 | | 
etigilimab AB308 | | | 

 
EOS-448 has high FcγR engagement, and therefore can promote antibody-mediated cell killing, which in turn can result in the depletion of cells expressing high level of TIGIT. Among the cells expressing high levels of TIGIT in the tumor microenvironment are Tregs. Tregs are specialized T cells that suppress immune effector cells to prevent a self-directed immune response against healthy cells. Tregs can also prevent an immune response directed against abnormal or unhealthy cells such as cancer cells. There is a growing body of evidence in animal models showing that TIGIT’s expression on Tregs has a functional role in immune suppression and tumor growth. In several preclinical models, anti-TIGIT antibodies with high binding affinity to FcγR and the ability to deplete TIGIT-expressing Tregs were shown to have stronger antitumor activity than similar antibodies without depleting activity. Similarly, in a mouse tumor model, reconstitution of the immune system with Tregs deficient in TIGIT resulted in a delayed tumor growth that was not shown if the Treg expressed TIGIT, further supporting the immunosuppressive role played by Tregs expressing TIGIT. These findings support the use of an anti-TIGIT antibody that engages FcγR, such as the design of EOS-448, to suppress the activity of TIGIT-expressing Tregs. 
 We selected for development EOS-448, an antibody that is designed to deplete Tregs in the tumor microenvironment while minimizing the impact on Tregs found in other organs and on effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment. As shown in the figure below, we have observed that TIGIT expression is significantly higher on the Tregs found in the tumor microenvironment than on circulating Tregs or on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whether in the tumor or in circulation. This relatively high expression level is expected to lead to preferred depletion of Tregs found in the tumor microenvironment. We also quantified the number of cells expressing TIGIT across a panel of PBMCs from healthy donors and cancer patients, as well as in TILs, with a specific focus on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as Tregs. The highest expression was found in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Based on these findings, we believe an IgG1 antibody, like EOS-448, could drive specific depletion of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment driven by ADCC.


In ex vivo experiments using immune cells from patients with solid tumors, we observed that EOS-448 led to the selective lysis of Tregs compared to CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. As shown in the figure below, in PBMCs isolated from a lung cancer patient, EOS-448 led to significant depletion of Tregs via lysis and lower levels of lysis 
 22

of CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells. We believe these data support our belief that EOS-448 can preferentially lead to killing of Treg cells while sparing effector T cells. 
 
In addition, we compared the functional potential of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs based on their expression of TIGIT receptor. As shown in the figure below for both populations, the proportion of IFNγ, IL-2, or TNFα expressing cells after ex vivo activation was observed to be much higher in cells with low TIGIT expression, or TIGIT- cells, versus cells with high TIGIT expression, or TIGIT+ cells, supporting the assertion that TIGIT-expressing TILs have an exhausted phenotype. Hence EOS-448 did appear to cause depletion of predominantly exhausted T cells while generally sparing the more active effector T cell population.
 

We have also shown in our in vivo preclinical studies that binding of our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody to FcγR is important for its antitumor activity. In a CT26 syngeneic model, we showed that functional activity, as measured by a higher proportion of IFNγ-producing CD8+ T cells, or CD8+ IFNγ, within the tumor, was increased in tumors dosed with our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody, which engages FcγR, as compared to tumors treated with an anti-TIGIT antibody that had low FcγR engagement, as shown in the figure below. 
 23


In this syngeneic model, we also found that in tumors treated with our anti-TIGIT antibody, Tregs were significantly decreased as illustrated in the figure below, while similar effects were not observed with anti-TIGIT antibodies without functional FcγR engagement. Similar results were observed in other models, including a Hepa1-6 hepatocellular carcinoma and a TIGIT-expressing EL4 T cell lymphoma. 
 

Consistent with these results, the antitumor activity of our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody was dependent on having a molecule with high FcγR engagement, and was also dependent on the expression of the FcγR itself on host cells, as shown in the figure below. We have shown that replacement of the Fc domain with one that has low binding to FcγR disabled the antibody’s ability to drive killing of Tregs as shown in the middle panel of the figure below. Similarly, in mice lacking the expression of the FcγR, known as FcγR knockout, or KO, mice, antitumor activity of the anti-TIGIT antibody was not observed regardless of whether the antibody had a functional Fc domain, as shown in the right panel of the figure below. 
 24


We have also shown in other preclinical experiments that the antitumor activity of our mouse anti-TIGIT antibody was dependent on NK and macrophage cells, cell types that express the FcγR and are activated by FcγR binding, as most of the antitumor activity was lost when one of these populations was depleted prior to treatment with our anti-TIGIT antibody. These data support the importance of the interaction between a functional Fc domain and the engagement of FcγR for the observed tumor response and support our design of EOS-448 as an IgG1 antibody with a functional Fc that engages FcγR. 
 We believe that the high affinity and superior potency of EOS-448 combined with its ability to activate the FcγR has the potential to bring significant clinical benefit as compared to other anti-TIGIT antibodies in development. 
 Preclinical toxicology of EOS-448 
 In a four-week toxicology study in non-human primates, EOS-448 at doses of 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg was generally well tolerated. EOS-448 exhibited a classical PK profile for a human IgG1 antibody, with dose proportional increases observed between the three tested doses. Dose proportional increases in occupancy of the receptor were also observed. Full occupancy was achieved and maintained through the dose interval of seven days at the highest dose. No drug-mediated adverse events were observed. An increase of C-reactive protein, a sign of induced inflammation, which was observed in some animals treated at the highest dose was not considered an adverse event. 
 Human safety data have been presented for two anti-TIGIT antibodies with an Fc format similar to that of EOS-448. Both demonstrated acceptable tolerability profiles in cancer patients and no dose limiting toxicities were observed at the highest doses tested, up to 20 mg/kg or 700 mg, respectively. 
 Clinical development of EOS-448 
 We are currently conducting an open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448 in adult patients with refractory solid tumors with the primary goal of assessing its safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended dose and schedule of administration. Based on EOS-448’s preclinical tolerability profile, we were able to select a relatively high starting dose, which we believe will enable us to efficiently achieve a therapeutic exposure during dose escalation. As of December 15, 2020, we had enrolled 22 patients to five dose levels. We plan to share preliminary results from the dose escalation portion of this trial at the 2021 AACR Annual Meeting in April. figure below illustrates the initial clinical development plan for EOS-448. 
 25


Potential opportunity for EOS-448 
 Following the dose escalation portion of our Phase 1/2a clinical trial, we plan to evaluate EOS-448 in combination with pembrolizumab and in combination with inupadenant in solid tumors and in combination with an IMID in multiple myeloma as we believe that EOS-448 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients across a wide array of tumors. We intend to select indications based on biologic rationale that we believe could predict meaningful clinical responses to EOS-448, considering the competitive landscape and unmet medical needs. Furthermore, combination experiments in preclinical models suggest that combining EOS-448 with a number of other immuno-oncology agents and chemotherapy regimens may lead to improved outcomes. 
 Our preclinical novel adenosine-pathway inhibitor program 
 We have developed significant expertise in tumor immunology and the tumor microenvironment, which we are exploiting to expand our pipeline. For example, by characterizing the impact of high concentrations of adenosine on immune cells, we have identified a novel mechanism within the adenosine pathway responsible for inhibiting the proliferation of T cells in the high adenosine concentrations that can be found in some tumors. We have further characterized this mechanism using human T lymphocytes. In preclinical studies, addition of ATP at a concentration of 100µM completely blocked CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro, while an antagonist of the novel target, we identified restored proliferation, as shown in the figure below. Inhibition of this target also promoted an antitumor effect in preclinical models and has potential for synergy with an A2AR antagonist.

Adimab is entitled to additional fees of up to a maximum of $0.4 million on a program-by-program basis for the achievement of certain technical milestones, one of which was met, and we paid $0.2 million in April 2017. Upon our exercise of an option for an exclusive development and commercialization license, with respect to a target, we are required to make a low single digit million-dollar payment to Adimab for each exercised option. For example, in August 2018, we paid a $1.0 million nonrefundable fee to exercise an option to acquire certain licenses from Adimab. One of the antibodies licensed under this agreement is what we now refer to as EOS-448. In addition, on a per target basis, we may be required to pay development, regulatory and commercial milestones totaling up to an aggregate of $42.8 million for the first three products and additional milestone payments up to $13.5 million for each additional product. We will pay Adimab low to mid-single-digit royalties on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, on worldwide net product sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right that covers such licensed product in such country, and (ii) ten years following the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. To date, we have paid a total of $3.4 million to Adimab pursuant the collaboration agreement. 
 Adimab controls the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the intellectual property that it licenses to us under the Adimab Agreement. We have the right to enforce such licensed intellectual property against infringement if the infringement is competitive with our licensed products and Adimab does not pursue enforcement. We control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the intellectual property we license to Adimab under the Adimab Agreement and all program antibody patents. 
 The term of the Adimab Agreement will continue until the last to expire royalty term on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis if we exercise our option, or in the event no option is exercised, the conclusion of the last-to-expire evaluation term, unless terminated earlier by either party. Each party has the right to terminate the Adimab Agreement due to the other party’s uncured material breach or our abandonment of the product. 
 On February 22, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Adimab Agreement (the Amended Adimab Agreement).  The Amended Adimab Agreement specifies different milestone payments for new products that are derived from research programs beginning after February 22, 2021 (New Products).  For New Products, on a per target basis, we may be required to pay development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of $45.8 million for the first three products and additional milestone payments up to $14.5 million for each additional product.  Royalty percentages for New Products are slightly different than for original products.  There were no other significant changes to the terms in the original Adimab Agreement as a result of the Amended Adimab Agreement.
 WuXi manufacturing agreement 
 In March 2017, we entered into a biologics master services agreement with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited, or WuXi, which we refer to as the WuXi Agreement. The WuXi Agreement provides for IND-enabling CMC development and GMP manufacturing of EOS-448 on a work order basis. Under the WuXi Agreement, we are obligated to pay WuXi a service fee in the amount specified in each work order associated with the agreement for the provision of services. If we manufacture all of our commercial supplies of EOS-448 with a manufacturer other 
 27

than WuXi, we must pay to WuXi either a low single-digit royalty fee on global net sales or a one-time milestone payment in the low tens of millions. 
 The WuXi Agreement terminates one year after the date on which the last work order has expired or been terminated, unless terminated earlier. The term of each work order terminates upon completion of the services under such work order, unless terminated earlier. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and established collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. 
 We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue immune-oncology treatments. For example, there are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, Incyte, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech. 
 For our small molecule antagonist of A2AR, inupadenant, we are aware of several other companies that are developing other adenosine receptor antagonists, including AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Incyte, Arcus Biosciences, Inc., or Arcus, and Novartis. To our knowledge, there are no adenosine receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced such selective A2AR antagonists are in Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 For our anti-TIGIT antibody, EOS-448, we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies developing antibodies against this target, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Mereo Biopharma Group plc, Roche/Genentech, Astellas Pharma, Beigene, Ltd., Arcus, Agenus, Seagen, Innovent, Merck KgaA, Junshi and Compugen Ltd. To our knowledge, there are no approved anti-TIGIT antibodies and the most advanced antibodies are in Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy, or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and a gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development. 
 28

The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. If we seek to acquire or license products, we will face substantial competition from a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have. These more established companies may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage. 
 Manufacturing and supply 
 We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities nor have any plans do so in the foreseeable future. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs to develop a suitable manufacturing process at scale and produce our small molecule and biologic product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. 
 To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and drug product for our product candidates from single-source third party CMOs, including WuXi. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates to ensure continuity of supply. 
 We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
 We expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
 Commercialization 
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. 
 We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine. 
 Intellectual property 
 We have six patent families directed to our A2AR program. One family discloses and claims certain A2AR antagonists, including inupadenant. This patent family is pending in multiple jurisdictions, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan and the United States.

A fifth family is directed to certain methods of treatment comprising administration of A2AR antagonists, such as inupadenant. This family is a provisional application, filed February 17, 2021. A 
 29

sixth family is directed to certain methods of treatment comprising administration of A2AR antagonists such as inupadenant. This family is a provisional application, filed March 5, 2021.
 We have two patent families directed to our anti-TIGIT antibody program. Both families disclose a number of anti-TIGIT antibodies, including EOS-448 (first disclosed and claimed in the first family) and antigen binding fragments thereof, and combinations comprising an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof with other chemotherapeutic or immuno-oncology agents such as, an anti-PD-1 antibody, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, an anti-41BB antibody, an anti-OX40 antibody, an anti-GITR antibody and anti- ICOS antibody. The first family has claims directed to the disclosed antibodies and combinations, is issued in the United States, and pending in multiple jurisdictions including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and South Africa. The statutory expiration for any patent issuing from this family is July 26, 2038. The second family is directed to use of anti-TIGIT antibodies, (including EOS-448) and antigen binding fragments thereof, as well as combinations (as described above for the first family) for promoting T cell activity or treating cancer. This family is pending as a PCT, having a 30-month national phase deadline of July 2021. The statutory expiration for any patent issuing from this family will be January 7, 2040. 
 Government regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, CROs and CMOs, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 In the United States, where we are initially focusing our product development, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are early-stage and has not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States. 
 Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA through either an NDA or a BLA process before they may be marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 30

 
• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical and clinical trials 
 Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development of a product candidate, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31

 
• | Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the drug or biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the drug or biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate. 
 FDA review process 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications, and a BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient or clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. 
 32

Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original NDA or BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS as a condition for approving the NDA or BLA to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools. 
 After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding 
 33

new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan designation and exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular clinically active component for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA or BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and Accelerated Approval. 
 A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track, or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For original NDAs and BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action 
 34

on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). 
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process. 
 FDA approval of companion diagnostics 
 In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs and biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of the products. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. 
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulation. The IDE regulations distinguish between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Many companion diagnostics are considered significant risk devices due to their role in diagnosing a disease or condition. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. 
 Device manufacturers are also subject to FDA’s medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, and FDA’s correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 35

U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs and biologics 
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by Company employees but also by agents of the Company or those speaking on the Company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved drugs and biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program fee for any marketed product. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | holds on clinical trials;
--+--------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and 
 37

potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other regulatory matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies. 
 Other healthcare laws 
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below. 
  
• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bride, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 38

 
• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also require reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party-payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers may also be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and that potentially harm consumers. 
 The distribution of drugs and biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The full scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have continued to increase their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and 
 39

Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, included changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA included provisions of importance to our potential product candidate that: 
  
• | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 40

 
• | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There remain numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court, and the former Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or biologics. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On March 10, 2020, the former Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the former Trump administration also previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, and it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to

control drug costs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 In 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita.  The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. However, in response to a lawsuit filed by several industry groups, on December 28, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining government defendants from implementing the MFN Rule pending completion of notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups in the U.S. District of Maryland, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the MFN Interim Final Rule shall not commence earlier than 60 days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2023. Further, implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed.
 In addition, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control

prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
 Compliance with other federal and state laws or requirements; changing legal requirements 
 If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations 
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. 
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

European Union drug development 
 In the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the Regulation, through an independent audit, currently expected to occur in December 2021.  The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU, for instance by providing for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications.
 We are in the process of applying to renew our status with EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise, or SME. If we obtain SME status with EMA, it will provide access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures. 
 European Union drug marketing 
 Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
 Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. 
 European drug review and approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
 44

 
• | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in another Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity 
 In the EEA, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the referenced product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market 
 45

exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. 
 European orphan designation and exclusivity 
 In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community, or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition must have been authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition). 
 In the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 European pediatric investigation plan 
 In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval). In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, which ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and 
 46

products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA, the UK medicines and medical devices regulator, has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 European data collection 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is governed by the GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the European Union. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Rest of the world regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 62 full-time employees, 28 of whom with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 47 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 15 employees are engaged in finance, legal, human resources, facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. At iTeos, we celebrate our differences and value the power of a diverse array of people who bring all of themselves to their work.  We embrace cultural, racial, gender, cognitive, social and professional diversity because we know that the only way we are going to make new cures possible is by working together. We prioritize employee development and seek to align employees’ goals with iTeos’ overall strategic direction. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values.  The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. For additional information on the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of COVID-19”.
