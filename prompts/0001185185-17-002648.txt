Item 1. Business.
 
In this Report, we use the terms “Company,” “XsunX,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” unless otherwise indicated, or the context otherwise requires, to refer to XsunX, Inc.
 
Organization
 
XsunX, Inc. (“XsunX,” the “Company” or the “issuer”) is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. “Sun River”). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a plan of reorganization and name change to XsunX, Inc.
 
Business Overview/Summary
 
XsunX specializes in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation (PV), energy storage in the form of managed battery systems, and energy use management technologies to provide our clients long term savings, predictability, and control of their energy costs. Making solar and managed energy solutions a sound investment for our clients is our mission.
 
We service the commercial self-generation energy market in California, and to a lesser extent the residential solar PV market where we see fewer barriers to entry and an overly competitive marketplace. We provide project assessment and installation services to our customers including technology selection, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty service, system monitoring and maintenance. We offer a wide variety of energy production and management technologies, design our systems in-house to ensure that the performance of the systems we deliver match the financial projections, and our full time project management and licensed assembly crews ensure a seamless process, from start to finish.
 
The Company operates as licensed contractor in California, and our executive management provides over 30 years of extensive experience in all aspects of construction and project assembly to ensure the accuracy and quality of systems, the continued integrity of the improved building or site, and compliance with all construction codes.
 
We guide our performance by striving to deliver consistently on the following core objectives:
 
● Commitment – to keeping the customer’s best interests at the forefront at all times; and,
 
● Value – through a focus on performance and follow through that meets or exceeds customer expectations.
 
Recent Developments
 
In the 2017 period we expanded our product group to include managed energy storage systems comprised of lithium batteries, charge/discharge control, and demand charge management software.  The addition of these product capabilities was in response to rising and shifting time-of-use and demand-based charges (measured in kilowatts) by utilities. Pairing solar PV with energy storage can significantly boost project returns through the monitoring and comparison of these time-of-use and demand charges to real-time facility energy needs to then deliver renewable or stored energy when it provides the greatest savings for operations. This product group focuses primarily on commercial facilities and can be installed as a stand-alone technology or paired with our commercial solar rooftop, carport, truckport, and covered storage canopy systems.
 
Also in 2017 we began efforts to offer our solar car, truck, and storage area solar canopy design/build capabilities to solar contractors and developers. Having established in-house capabilities to design, directly source all the major system components, and install canopy systems has provided us with what we believe is an advantage over other solar contractors whom typically rely on costly third-party specialty contractors to install canopy systems for their solar projects. We believe that offering canopy design/build services to solar contractors creates an opportunity to expand sales for these services for which this group of contractor/customers were already seeking assistance with.
 
Market Drivers for Solar Power
 
We believe that a significant demand for solar power and energy storage solutions is developing as a result of following drivers:
 

• | Solar and stored energy provides the ability to control and predict future energy costs. Our customers invest in the ability to self-generate power and to manage the use and delivery of energy to their operations. These investments provide predictability and control of energy costs, and can significantly reduce overall energy costs while insulating clients from rising retail electricity prices.

• | Maturity and dependability of solar and energy storage technologies. The results and benefits from investments in solar power systems and, the growing effectiveness of new battery chemistries have produced extensive statistical performance data. This historical performance data allows investment benefits for near and long-term future operations to be accurately estimated. This provides customers greater reliance on future results, and the confidence to make investments. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Rapid capital recovery of energy management investments. Reports provided by U.S. Energy Department continue to indicate that the installed price reductions for solar PV and energy storage systems are driving growth for installation demand. These cost reductions for the major components allow us to provide per watt pricing for solar PV and per kilowatt hour pricing for energy storage that, coupled with tax and operating benefits, can often result in capital investment recovery within 3 to 4 years. 
• | Government Incentives. Helping to further facilitate the market for investments into self-generated power are Federal, State, and local government tax and investment incentives. Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, operators, and end users of solar and energy storage systems to promote self-generation energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments and, to a diminishing degree, other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. These incentives help to drive customer acceptance of self-generation energy as an alternative to utility-provided power. The Federal government currently offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2016. By statute, this tax credit was scheduled to decrease to 10% on January 1, 2017, but was extended in December by Congress through 2019, after which it will fall to 26 percent in 2020, 22 percent in 2021 and 10 percent in 2022 for future periods. The investment economics for purchasing a solar or energy storage system are also increased through eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. This acceleration of the investment depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and improves the return on solar investment.

Customers
 
The majority of our revenue comes from installations of commercial solar systems in California.  Approximately 83% of our sales in 2017 were in the commercial market and approximately 17% were generated by residential sales. We anticipate that through our expanding efforts to promote the sale of our solar canopy and managed energy storage offerings revenues for commercial sales will continue to outpace residential sales through the 2018 period.
 
Our commercial system sales service the needs of property owners installing solar PV systems typically larger than 20kW, and energy storage systems that start at 60 kilowatt hours of storage capacity.  However, system size and installation type can vary significantly in scope from rooftop solar only installations to solar rooftop and carport, truckport, or covered storage combined installations with integrated whole building energy management solutions. The average cycle time for commercial rooftop installs range approximately 6 to 8 weeks with solar canopies such as carports, truck ports, and covered storage requiring as much as twelve to twenty weeks due to additional permitting requirement and reviews. We help to facilitate financing options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
 Our residential sales address the needs of property owners typically installing systems smaller than 15kW.  The average cycle time for residential rooftop installs is approximately 3 weeks. We help to facilitate financing options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
Sales, Marketing, and Planned Operations
 
 We have focused our sales efforts and operations on the delivery of commercial solar power and energy storage systems in the California market. We believe that our focus provides us long term benefits for brand development as a commercial specialist within a market that we believe to be in the early stages of growth, and poised for a broad adoption of solar power generation. 
 
We see this as a significant business development opportunity as management has the skillset associated with construction management, the licensing qualifications necessary for us to operate as a contractor in California, we have extensive experience associated with solar PV technologies and the design requirements associated with the delivery of a commercial power systems, and there is a market demand available for us to provide these services to. We believe that these efforts will provide us with the fastest path to increasing revenue generation.


In the 2017 period we expanded our product group to include managed energy storage systems comprised of lithium batteries, charge/discharge control, and demand charge management software.  The addition of these capabilities was in response to rising and shifting time-of-use and demand-based charges (measured in kilowatts) by utilities. Pairing solar PV with energy storage can significantly boost project returns through the monitoring and comparison of these time-of-use and demand charges to real-time facility energy needs to then deliver renewable or stored energy when it provides the greatest savings for operations. This product group focuses primarily on commercial facilities and can be installed as a stand-alone technology or paired with our commercial solar rooftop, carport, truckport, and covered storage canopy systems.
 
Also in 2017 we began efforts to offer our solar car, truck, and storage area canopy design/build capabilities to solar contractors and developers. Having established in-house capabilities to design, directly source all the major system components, and install canopy systems has provided us with what we believe is an advantage over other solar contractors whom typically rely on costly third-party specialty contractors to install canopy systems for their solar projects. We believe that offering canopy design/build services to solar contractors creates an opportunity to expand sales for these services for which this group of contractor/customers were already seeking assistance with.
 
While residential rooftop solar will continue to offer sales growth opportunities, we believe that our focus on non-residential solar power, managed energy storage, and solar canopy systems can, in many instances, provide us with opportunities to offer customers diverse installation options, larger project sizing, greater energy savings, and the ability to differentiate XsunX from competitors.

We plan to continue to focus our marketing efforts in the 2018 period highlighting the advantages of these product groups through efforts that include web advertising, direct outside sales, targeted direct marketing, commissioned consultants, and the referral of satisfied customers. 
Operations and Supply
 
We purchase all of our system components such as solar panels, inverters, batteries, charge controllers, management software, and solar module mounting hardware directly from manufacturers and supply houses. When possible, we have established direct factory purchasing relationships. We have selected these suppliers and components based on cost, reliability, availability, warranty coverage, ease of installation, application design and suitability, and technology advantages.
 
Additionally, to compete favorably we have established relationships with lenders through which we can introduce financing options for the systems we design and install. These financing options provide an alternative cash management solution for our target customers, and a sales inducement to purchase systems.
 
For the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will purchase the system components for each project on an as-needed basis from suppliers at the then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued. Due to the volatility of component pricing we do not anticipate any supplier arrangements that will contain long-term pricing or volume commitments. Should our sales results, volume, and market conditions warrant we may in the future elect to make purchase commitments to ensure sufficient supply and reduced pricing of the components that we use.
 
Our operations focus is to provide complete project design, management of engineering, facility preparation, installation of systems, repair or restoration to all affected areas resulting from the installation process, and any ongoing maintenance. To accomplish this we use the services of licensed service professionals in each of the representative trades or specialties necessary. Additionally, we provide qualified staff to supervise project operations, inspections, and system start up and energizing. In the 2018 fiscal period we anticipate that our sales may increase, and we plan to expand our direct project management capabilities through the addition of qualified field supervisory and engineering staff.
 
Competition
 
We compete with companies that offer solar and energy saving technologies. Many of these competitors have greater resources and access to broader national markets than we do. Our primary areas of competition in the California markets we serve are on pricing, the ability to deliver designs and technology integration that match client goals, service, and the ability to arrange financing. However, when competing for solar installation projects our experience has shown that there is no clear preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We also compete with traditional utilities who have well-established relationships with our target customers providing the ease of a status quo relationship without upfront investment costs. The advantages we offer over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create and to manage the use of their own electricity, detach from the traditional electrical grid dependency, and create profitable long-term investments in energy.
Intellectual Property
 
The following is an outline of certain patents and technologies we have developed, attempted to develop, have acquired, or licensed:
 
The Company has previously worked to develop a hybrid manufacturing solution to produce high performance Copper Indium Gallium (di) Selenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells.  The technology, which we called CIGSolar, focused on the mass production of individual thin-film CIGS solar cells that match silicon solar cell dimensions and could be offered as a non-toxic, high-efficiency and lowest-cost alternative to the use of silicon solar cells.
 
In April 2012 we filed claims related to our thermal effusion source design. In October 2014 we received a Restriction Requirement from the United States Patent and Trademark Office that reports the results of the initial examination of the patent application.  The examination by the USPTO asserts that the application is directed to two distinct inventions and has issued a restriction requirement.  The term “restriction” is applied where the Examiner believes that two (2) or more inventions are separately claimed in the same patent application.  Thus, by issuing the restriction requirement, the Examiner is asserting that our application covers more than one invention. 
 
After completing a review of options related to modifying our patent application, and the limited market conditions related to the demand for thin film technologies, we elected to abandon our claims. We do not anticipate any further efforts related to filing or pursuing patent claims related to our prior thin film CIGS efforts.

In September 2003, the Company was assigned the rights to three patents as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement with Xoptix Inc., a California corporation. The patents acquired were No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003. We do not currently employ nor envision the use of the above-named patents in the development or commercialization of our CIGSolar technology. Because of technological and business developments within the solar industry, we believe that these patents no longer provide business opportunities for the Company to pursue and we have abandoned maintenance of these patents.
 
On July 10, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a certificate of registration No. 4,172,218 granting the Company a trademark for the use of “CIGSolar”. Because of not having used this trademark during the previous fiscal years we elected to abandon any continued use of this trade mark and allowed the registration to expire in the 2017 fiscal period.
 
We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have not been subject to any intellectual property claims.
 
Company History
 
XsunX is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. (“Sun River”). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a Plan of Reorganization and Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Plan”).
 
Pursuant to the Plan, the Company acquired the following three patents from Xoptix, Inc., a California corporation for Seventy Million (70,000,000) shares of common stock (post reverse split one for twenty): No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003.
 
Pursuant to the Plan, the Company authorized the issuance of 110,530,000 (post reverse split) common shares. Prior to the Plan, the Company had no tangible assets and insignificant liabilities. Subsequent to the Plan, the Company completed its name change from Sun River Mining, Inc. to XsunX, Inc. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2003.
 
Government Contracts
 
There are no government contracts as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
The operations of the Company are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Compliance with these regulations by the Company has required that, when necessary, we retain the use of engineering and design firms of systems related to equipment operations, and occupancy fire and safety construction standards to deal with compliance of safety standards. We do not anticipate that these costs will have a material effect on the Company’s operations or competitive position as these requirements apply to our competition as well, and the cost of such compliance is typically incorporated into projects costs. The Company is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities.
 
To systems we sell require interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility prior to operation. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. A primary area of compliance are the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Employees and Consultants
 
As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we had two full-time employees including Mr. Tom Djokovich who is President and CEO. While we do add to, and reduce, the size of our workforce based on current needs this represents one full-time employee change to the same period ended 2016. To compensate our need for additional staff the Company also relies on qualified consultants and licensed professionals to perform specific functions that otherwise would require an employee. As we expand our business developments efforts we may need to add staff to adequately respond to sales inquiries, project management, and general labor as warranted. We consider relations with our employees and consultants to be good.

Seasonality
 
Our operations have, in the past, experienced some seasonality for commercial sales with increased demand early and later in in each year. We believe that this trend may be related to late year project sales stemming from client interest in accessing same year tax benefits for solar investments, and early year sales related to fiscal budgeting for energy projects to be installed.
