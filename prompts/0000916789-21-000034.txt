Item 1. Business
Our Company
We incorporated as Helen of Troy Corporation in Texas in 1968 and were reorganized as Helen of Troy Limited in Bermuda in 1994. We are a leading global consumer products company offering creative products and solutions for our customers through a diversified portfolio of brands. We have built leading market positions through new product innovation, product quality and competitive pricing. We go to market under a number of brands, some of which are licensed. Our Leadership Brands are brands which have number-one or number-two positions in their respective categories and include the OXO, Honeywell, Braun, PUR, Hydro Flask, Vicks, Hot Tools and Drybar brands.
Segment Information
We currently operate in three business segments, which are included in our financial statements in continuing operations:
•Housewares: Provides a broad range of innovative consumer products for the home and on the go to help with food preparation, cooking, cleaning, organization, beverage service, and other tasks to ease everyday living for families. This segment sells primarily to retailers as well as through our direct-to-consumer channel.
•Health & Home: Provides healthcare and home environment products including health care devices, water filtration systems and small home appliances. Sales for the segment are primarily to retailers, with some direct-to-consumer channel sales.
•Beauty: Provides mass and prestige market beauty appliance and personal care products including hair styling appliances, grooming tools, decorative haircare accessories, and liquid-, solid- and powder-based personal care and grooming products. This segment sells primarily to retailers, beauty supply wholesalers and through our direct- to- consumer channel.
Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are presented from continuing operations. Discontinued operations refers to our former Nutritional Supplements segment, which was divested on December 20, 2017. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.
For more segment and geographic information concerning our net sales revenue, long-lived assets and operating income, refer to Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Our Strategic Initiatives
In fiscal 2015, we launched a five-year transformational strategy designed to improve the performance of our business segments and strengthen our shared service capabilities. Fiscal 2019 marked the completion of Phase I of our multi-year transformation strategy, which delivered performance across a wide range of measures. We improved organic sales growth by focusing on our Leadership Brands, made strategic acquisitions, became a more efficient operating company with strong global shared services, upgraded our organization and culture, improved inventory turns and return on invested capital, and returned capital to shareholders.
Fiscal 2020 began Phase II of our transformation, which is designed to drive the next five years of progress. The long-term objectives of Phase II include improved organic sales growth, continued margin expansion, and strategic and effective capital deployment. Phase II includes continued investment in our Leadership Brands, with a focus on growing them through consumer-centric innovation, expanding them 
more aggressively outside the U.S., and adding new brands through acquisition. We are building further shared service capability and operating efficiency, as well as focusing on attracting, retaining, unifying and training the best people. Additionally, we are enhancing and consolidating our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) efforts and accelerating programs related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”) to support our Phase II transformation.
On January 23, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Drybar Products LLC (“Drybar Products”), for approximately $255.9 million in cash. Drybar is an innovative, trend-setting prestige hair care and styling brand in the multibillion-dollar beauty industry. As part of the transaction, we granted a worldwide license to Drybar Holdings LLC, which has subsequently been assumed by WellBiz Brands, Inc., as successor owner of Drybar blowout salons, to use the Drybar trademark in relation to the franchising and operation of Drybar salons. The salons exclusively use, promote, and sell Drybar products globally. The acquisition of Drybar Products added an 8th Leadership Brand to the Company.
Consistent with our strategy of focusing resources on our Leadership Brands, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we committed to a plan to divest certain assets within our Beauty segment's mass channel personal care business (“Personal Care”). The assets to be disposed of include intangible assets, inventory, certain net trade receivables and fixed assets relating to our mass channel liquids, powder and aerosol products under brands such as Pert, Brut, Sure and Infusium. Accordingly, we classified the identified assets of the disposal group as held for sale. We expect the divestiture to occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

We have classified the identified assets as held for sale. For additional information see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Our Trademarks
We market products under a number of trademarks that we own and sell certain of our products under trademarks licensed from third parties. We believe our principal trademarks, both owned and licensed, have high levels of brand name recognition among retailers and consumers throughout the world. Through our favorable partnerships with our licensors, we believe we have developed stable, enduring relationships that provide access to unique brands that complement our owned and internally developed trademarks.
The Beauty and Health & Home segments rely on the continued use of trademarks licensed under various agreements for a substantial portion of their net sales revenue. New product introductions under licensed trademarks require approval from the respective licensors. The licensors must also approve the product packaging. Some of our license agreements require us to pay minimum royalties.
The following table lists our key trademarks by segment:

Segment | Owned | Licensed 
Housewares | OXO, Good Grips, Hydro Flask, Soft Works, OXO tot, OXO Brew | 
Health & Home | PUR | Honeywell, Braun, Vicks
Beauty | Drybar, Hot Tools, Brut, Pert, Sure, Infusium | Revlon, Bed Head 

Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We maintain utility and design patents in the U.S. and several foreign countries. We also protect certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Sales and Marketing
We currently market our products in over 90 countries throughout the world. Sales within the U.S. comprised approximately 79% of total net sales revenue in both fiscal 2021 and 2020 and 78% of total net sales revenue in fiscal 2019. Our segments primarily sell their products through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, home improvement stores, grocery stores, specialty stores, beauty supply retailers, e-commerce retailers, wholesalers, and various types of distributors, as well as directly to consumers. We collaborate extensively with our retail customers and, in many instances, produce specific versions of our product lines with exclusive designs and packaging for their stores, which are appropriately priced for their respective customer bases. We market products principally through the use of outside sales representatives and our own internal sales staff, supported by our internal marketing, category management, engineering, creative services, and customer and consumer service staff. These groups work closely together to develop pricing and distribution strategies, to design packaging and to help develop product line extensions and new products.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities focus on new, differentiated and innovative products designed to drive sustained organic growth. We continually invest to strengthen our product design and research and development capabilities, including extensive studies to gain consumer insights. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and employee benefit expenses and contracted development and testing efforts associated with development of products.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We contract with unaffiliated manufacturers, primarily in China and Mexico, to manufacture a significant portion of our finished goods for the Beauty appliances and accessories, Housewares, Healthcare, Water Filtration, and Home Environment product categories. The North American region of the personal care category of the Beauty segment sources most of its products from U.S. manufacturers. Finished goods manufactured by vendors in the Far East comprised approximately 80%, 76% and 74% of finished goods purchased for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We occupy owned and leased office and distribution space in various locations to support our operations. These facilities include our U.S. headquarters in El Paso, Texas, and distribution centers in Southaven, Mississippi, and Olive Branch, Mississippi, which are used to support a significant portion of our domestic distribution.
Customers
Sales to our largest customer, Amazon.com Inc., accounted for approximately 20%, 18% and 16% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales to our second largest customer, Walmart, Inc. (including its worldwide affiliates), accounted for approximately 13%, 14% and 16% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales to our third largest customer, Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 11%, 9% and 10% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales revenue during these fiscal years. Sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 52%, 50% and 51% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Order Backlog
When placing orders, our individual consumer, retail and wholesale customers usually request that we ship the related products within a short time frame. As such, there usually is no significant backlog of orders in any of our distribution channels.
Seasonality
The following table illustrates the seasonality of our net sales revenue by fiscal quarter as a percentage of annual net sales revenue for the periods presented:

 | Fiscal Quarters Ended Last Day of Month
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
May | 20.0 | % | | 22.0 | % | 22.7 | %
August | 25.3 | % | | 24.2 | % | 25.2 | %
November | 30.4 | % | | 27.8 | % | 27.6 | %
February | 24.3 | % | | 26.0 | % | 24.5 | %

Our sales are seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns. Historically, the third fiscal quarter produces the highest net sales revenue during the fiscal year.
Competitive Conditions
We generally sell our products in markets that are very competitive and mature. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other 
branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We believe that we have certain key competitive advantages, such as well recognized brands, engineering expertise and innovation, sourcing and supply chain know-how, and productive co-development relationships with our Far East manufacturers. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing activities, as well as an extensive sales force in order to build awareness and to encourage new consumers to try our brands and products. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We believe these advantages allow us to bring our retailers a differentiated value proposition.
The following table summarizes our primary competitors by business segment:

Segment | Competitor 
Housewares | Lifetime Brands, Inc. (KitchenAid), Newell Brands Inc., Simple Human LLC, Yeti Holdings, Inc., Bradshaw Home, Inc. 
Health & Home | Exergen Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Crane Engineering, Newell Brands, Inc., Lasko Products, LLC., The Clorox Company (Brita), Zero Technologies, LLC, Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Dyson Ltd, Unilever (Blueair), Guardian Technologies LLC.
Beauty | Conair, Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. (Remington), Newell Brands, Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever N.V., Colgate-Palmolive Company, Coty Inc., Dyson Ltd 

Environmental and Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions’ environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Many of the products we sell are subject to product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. These laws and regulations specify the maximum allowable levels of certain materials that may be contained in our products, provide statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, specify product safety testing requirements, and set product identification, labeling and claim requirements.
Additionally, an emerging trend with both governments and our retail customers is to prescribe public and private social accountability reporting requirements regarding our worldwide business activities. In our product space, some requirements have already been mandated and we believe others may become required in the future. Examples of current requirements include conflict minerals content reporting, customer reporting of foreign fair labor practices in connection with our supply chain vendors, and evaluating the risks of human trafficking and slavery.
We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and other reporting requirements. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition, nor do we expect it to do so in the foreseeable future. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance and social reporting standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty what future material capital or operating expenditures, if any, will be required in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other reporting mandates.
ESG Initiatives 
We seek to maintain best-in-class level of corporate governance on behalf of our stakeholders, including our associates, customers, consumers, communities, and shareholders. We also recognize the importance of environmental and social factors related to how we operate our business. We are enhancing and consolidating our ESG efforts and accelerating programs related to DE&I to support our Phase II transformation.
We have expanded the oversight responsibilities of the Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors to include ESG matters and convened an internal ESG Task Force with representatives from our business segments and global shared services. The ESG Task Force, in conjunction with our internal ESG resources, will lead the development and implementation of our strategic ESG plan with the goal of aligning our ESG performance with relevant standards such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and the Task Force on Climate Finance Disclosures (“TCFD”). We will also continue to advance our DE&I efforts as part of our ESG initiatives to support our focus on attracting and retaining top talent, and to help promote a work environment where everyone has the opportunity to grow to their fullest potential. 
We believe progress on our ESG initiatives will have a positive impact on our shareholders, consumers, customers, our talented worldwide employees and the communities in which we are proud to live and work. 
Human Capital
Overview
We are committed to fostering a positive and engaging culture of inclusion, care, and support where all people throughout our global workforce can thrive. Resources provided to enhance employees' “total well-being” include learning and development opportunities, charitable leave policy, financial advice and stock purchase programs, health and wellness programs, and product discounts. Perks and benefits vary by region and office. We also monitor our culture and associate engagement through a number of methods, including an annual culture survey.
We have a robust performance evaluation and feedback program for all our associates. We encourage career planning at all levels of the organization. Opportunities for advancement are available to all of our employees fairly and equally. Our senior leadership team develops and recommends to the Board of Directors succession plans for all of our senior management.
We believe our culture, fair pay, benefits, healthy-living initiatives, collaborative projects, and open communication between management and staff enables us to attract and retain talented associates. 
Our Associates
As of February 28, 2021, we employed approximately 1,769 full-time employees worldwide. We also use temporary, part-time and seasonal employees as needed.
None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain of our employees in Europe are covered by collective arrangements or works counsel in accordance with local practice. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our employees.
DE&I
We believe that a diverse workforce is essential to innovation, growth, and the well-being of our associates. We celebrate the diversity of our people and value the unique perspectives they bring. We are committed to cultivating an inclusive culture where all of our associates can thrive.
We are advancing short- and long-term initiatives which include: leadership coaching and training to build awareness and sponsorship, targeted recruitment actions to increase diversity of new hires, associate learning programs to develop skills that foster inclusion, and associate affinity groups to further support inclusion.
Communities
We have a 50-plus-year tradition of supporting the communities where we live and work through charitable donations from both the Company and its associates. In addition, we provide our associates two paid community service days to donate their time to organizations that matter most to them. We believe our community engagement and good corporate citizenship will lead to stronger communities and shared success for our Company.
