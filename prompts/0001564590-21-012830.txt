Vertical Markets
 The Company provides a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, financial services, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), manufacturing, and energy. The remainder of CTG’s revenue is derived from general markets.
 CTG’s revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:
 
 
 | 2020 | | | 2019 | | 2018
-----------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Technology service providers | | 32.7 | % | | 32.2 | % | 32.4 | %
Financial services | | 15.7 | % | | 13.8 | % | 15.2 | %
Healthcare | | 14.9 | % | | 16.6 | % | 16.2 | %
Manufacturing | | 13.5 | % | | 16.8 | % | 19.5 | %
Energy | | 6.3 | % | | 5.2 | % | 4.7 | %
General markets | | 16.9 | % | | 15.4 | % | 12.0 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
Revenue for the Company's technology service providers vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased slightly in 2020 as compared with 2019. Overall, the Company’s revenue decreased in 2020 as the global COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the Company’s staffing services. However, demand from our largest staffing client, IBM, which is included in this vertical market, decreased at a rate consistent with the Company’s overall decrease in revenue. The revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue decrease in 2019 as compared with 2018 was due to a change in business mix as the Company focused on selling its IT Solutions services, which are not included in this vertical market.
 Revenue for the Company’s financial services vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased in 2020 as compared with 2019 due to acquisitions completed by the Company in 2019 and 2020. Revenue decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to lower demand in this vertical market throughout our European operations. 
 In 2020, the demand from our healthcare clients decreased at a rate that was above the overall revenue decrease for the Company, which caused the percentage of total revenue to decrease. Additionally, a significant project in this vertical market was essentially complete by the end of 2019 and was not replaced in 2020. This was a reversal of the trend of an increase in 2019 as compared with 2018 as revenue increased in that year due to the large project previously mentioned.

The revenue in our manufacturing vertical market is primarily generated from several large staffing clients, including Lenovo (through SDI as a vendor manager for Lenovo), which is our second largest client. Revenue from Lenovo and other large clients decreased in 2020 as compared with 2019, and in 2019 as compared with 2018, as the demand for these services, which include some non-IT staffing, decreased in recent years. Additionally, the Company continues to disengage from its lowest margin staffing business, which is generally included in this vertical market. 
 Revenue for the Company's energy vertical market increased as a percentage of consolidated revenue in both 2020 and 2019 given strong demand for our services in this vertical market.
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, CTG provided its services to 601 clients, primarily in North America and Europe. In North America, the Company operates in the United States and Canada, with about 99% of 2020 North American revenue generated in the United States. In Europe, the Company operates in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. Of total 2020 consolidated revenue of $366.1 million, approximately 56% was generated in North America and 44% in Europe. Revenue generated in India and Colombia was insignificant. One client, IBM, accounted for greater than 10% of CTG’s consolidated revenue in 2020.
 Revenue Recognition and Backlog
 The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the client. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company’s performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the client. On most fixed-price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the client to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the client controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company’s estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.
 The Company’s revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:
 
 
 | 2020 | | | 2019 | | 2018
-------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Time-and-material | | 81.0 | % | | 79.6 | % | 84.7 | %
Progress billing | | 15.9 | % | | 10.2 | % | 10.5 | %
Percentage-of-completion | | 3.1 | % | | 10.2 | % | 4.8 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the backlog for fixed-price and all managed-support contracts was approximately $50.9 million and $53.6 million, respectively. Approximately 70% or $35.7 million of the December 31, 2020 backlog is expected to be earned in 2021. Approximately 56% of the $53.6 million of backlog at December 31, 2019, or $30.3 million, was earned in 2020. Revenue is subject to slight seasonal variations, with a minor slowdown and a decrease in billable resource utilization in months of high vacation and legal holidays (July, August, and December). Backlog does not tend to be seasonal; however, it does fluctuate based upon the timing of entry into long-term contracts.
 Competition
 The IT services market, for both information and technology solutions and IT and professional staffing services, is highly competitive. The market is also highly fragmented with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Competition varies by location, the type of service, and the client to whom services are provided. The Company’s competition comes from four major channels: large national or international companies, including major accounting and consulting firms and large companies headquartered in India; hardware vendors and suppliers of 
 6

packaged software systems; small local firms or individuals specializing in specific programming services or applications; and from a client’s internal IT staff. CTG competes against all four of these channels for its share of the market. The Company believes that to compete successfully, it is necessary to have a local geographic presence, offer appropriate IT solutions, provide skilled professional resources, and price its services competitively.
 Intellectual Property
 The Company has registered its symbol and logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has taken steps to preserve its rights in other countries where it operates. We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them in the United States and foreign countries to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like any other company, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. CTG has entered into agreements with various software and hardware vendors from time to time in the normal course of business, and has capitalized certain costs under software development projects.
Human Capital Resources
 Employees
 CTG’s business depends on the Company’s ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professional staff to execute our strategy and provide services to its clients. The Company has a structured recruiting organization that works with its clients to meet their requirements by recruiting, retaining, and providing high quality, motivated staff. As the Company works with a number of subcontractors within CTG France, which was acquired on February 15, 2018, the Company now includes subcontractors in its total headcount, which equals approximately 3,900 total resources worldwide, with approximately 2,450 in the United States and Canada and 1,450 in Europe, as of December 31, 2020. Of these resources, approximately 91% are IT professionals and 9% are individuals who work in sales, recruiting, delivery, administrative and support positions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good and supported by the Company’s 2020 recognition as a Great Place to Work® in North America, Belgium, and Luxembourg. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. CTG is an equal opportunity employer.
COVID-19 Response
 The health, well-being and safety of our employees, clients and communities is our top priority. The Company began to focus on COVID-19 as a potentially significant issue during the first quarter of 2020 as we followed global developments and observed the impacts of COVID-19 in several European markets where we operate. Our senior management team initiated regular COVID-19 planning sessions to address the critical safety, operational and business risks associated with the pandemic. With our continued commitment to monitor, assess and implement guidance and best practices for the Company as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we have been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide to our clients, while also managing the impact of the spread of the virus within our business, as well as promoting the health, well-being and safety of our employees, clients and communities.
