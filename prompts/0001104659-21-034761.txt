ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General 
 
Lipocine Inc. (“Lipocine” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated on June 19, 1997, under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on applying our oral drug delivery technology for the development of pharmaceutical products focusing on metabolic and endocrine disorders. Our proprietary delivery technologies are designed to improve patient compliance and safety through orally available treatment options. Our primary development programs are based on oral delivery solutions for poorly bioavailable drugs. We have a portfolio of proprietary product candidates designed to produce favorable pharmacokinetic (“PK”) characteristics and facilitate lower dosing requirements, bypass first-pass metabolism in certain cases, reduce side effects, and eliminate gastrointestinal interactions that limit bioavailability.
 
Our most advanced product candidate, TLANDO™, is an oral testosterone replacement therapy (“TRT” or “T-replacement therapy”) comprised of testosterone undecanoate (“TU”). On December 8, 2020, we received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regarding our New Drug Application ("NDA") filed in February 2020 for TLANDO as a TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. In granting tentative approval, the FDA concluded that TLANDO has met all required quality, safety and efficacy standards necessary for approval. However, TLANDO has not received final approval and is not eligible for final approval to market in the U.S. until the expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. with respect to Jatenzo®, which expires on March 27, 2022. We are currently reviewing the FDA’s tentative approval of TLANDO and remain committed to taking appropriate actions with the goal of receiving final approval to permit the launch of TLANDO. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), if TLANDO receives full approval, we will need to address the PREA requirement to assess the safety and effectiveness of TLANDO in pediatric patients. The FDA has also required us to conduct certain post-marketing studies including: (i) conduct an appropriately designed label comprehension and knowledge study that assesses patient understanding of key risk messages in the Medication Guide for TLANDO and (ii) conduct an appropriately designed one-year trial to evaluate development of adrenal insufficiency with chronic TLANDO therapy. The timetables for these post-marketing requirements will be established at the time of full approval of TLANDO.

Additional pipeline candidates include LPCN 1144, an oral prodrug of bioidentical testosterone comprised of TU for the treatment of non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) which is currently in Phase 2 testing, TLANDO XR, a next generation oral TRT product comprised of testosterone tridecanoate (“TT”) with the potential for once daily dosing which has completed Phase 2 testing, LPCN 1148, an oral prodrug of bioidentical testosterone for the treatment of NASH cirrhosis, and LPCN 1107, potentially the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate product indicated for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth, which has completed a dose finding Phase 2 clinical study and has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.
 
LPCN 1144 is currently being tested in the LiFT (“Liver Fat intervention with oral Testosterone”) Phase 2 clinical study, a paired-biopsy study in confirmed non-cirrhotic NASH subjects. Study enrollment has been completed and top-line primary endpoint results after 12 weeks of treatment were released in January 2021. Top-line primary endpoints indicated that treatments with LPCN 1144 resulted in significant liver fat reduction, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, proton density fat fraction (“MRI-PDFF”) technique, and showed improvement of key liver injury markers with no observed tolerability issues.

Testosterone Background
 
Testosterone, or T, is the primary circulating sex hormone in males and is critical to the development and maturation of reproductive tissues as well as other secondary male characteristics such as muscle growth and bone density. Synthesized in the gonads of both males (testis) and females (ovaries), testosterone circulates bound to sex hormone binding globulin (~60%), loosely bound to albumin, a protein in the blood that binds to testosterone (~40%), or as a free molecule (~1%). Once circulating, testosterone enters cells directly and activates a network of proteins that ultimately result in metabolic conversions, which in turn produce observable effects. The concentration of circulating testosterone can vary drastically over time or between individuals and can be dependent on genetic factors, other medical conditions, lifestyle behaviors, and/or concurrent medication administration. Although large variability exists, the effects of testosterone are also determined by a number of factors including the amount of steroid penetration, sensitivity of enzymes and cellular proteins to the hormone, and the action of genomic receptors at the cellular level. As a result, assessing clinically low, or potentially high, levels of naturally occurring testosterone often requires a number of quantitative tests in conjunction with clinical evaluations.
Hypogonadism Overview
 
Low serum testosterone causes significant clinical impact and can result in erectile dysfunction, low libido, decreased muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, decreased bone density, decreased vitality and depressed mood. Furthermore, low serum testosterone concentrations have been found to be an independent predictor of a number of cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, abnormal lipid levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and systemic inflammation. Well-designed, prospective clinical trials have determined that low testosterone levels are also independently associated with mortality risk. These findings have generated interest amongst the medical community and general public regarding the importance of maintaining appropriate serum testosterone levels, which has stimulated growth of the testosterone replacement therapy market which peaked in 2013. The testosterone therapy market contracted in 2014 due to a number of factors including the withdrawal of direct to consumer advertising mid-2014 but has seen year-over-year growth since 2014.
 
Hypogonadism typically refers to a permanent deficiency of sex hormones rather than a temporary deficiency that may be related to acute/chronic illnesses or other medical, personal, or environmental factors. Primary hypogonadism describes disease states that intrinsically affect the gonads. Examples of these include the genetic disorders, Turner syndrome and Kleinfelter syndrome. Secondary hypogonadism refers to disease states that affect gonadal-related structures such as the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that directly impact the development of gonads and as such the release of testosterone and other sexual hormones. Kallmann syndrome, in which patients fail to undergo all of the changes associated with puberty, is a type of secondary hypogonadism. Although a number of inherited diseases are known to affect the gonads either directly or indirectly, it is generally believed that the majority of individuals with hypogonadism develop the condition as a result of age-related declines in testosterone or other acquired conditions.
 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Hypogonadism
 
Epidemiological studies have determined that total testosterone follows an age-related decline with mean serum concentration at the age of 75 years approximately two thirds that at 25 years. Because naturally occurring testosterone exists at low concentrations, with normal testosterone levels in the range of 300 to 1000 ng/dL automated platform-based assays have been found to lack specificity and are prone to inter-lab variability. The lack of reliable laboratory tests is complicated further by the inter-individual variability seen in an unaffected population. Thus, in order to accurately diagnose hypogonadism in a male, at least two morning serum testosterone levels are performed in conjunction with a clinical assessment of patient symptoms. Patients can only be diagnosed when they present with symptoms that are directly related to low morning serum testosterone level.

Treatment for male hypogonadism (both primary and secondary) is TRT. Some of the reported benefits of TRT include improved libido and sexual function; increased bone density, muscle development, and cognition; as well as a reduction in other risk factors caused by low testosterone.
 
Testosterone Replacement Market 
 
Due to the wide variability in therapeutic range and other medical conditions that may confound an accurate diagnosis, there is a consensus that male hypogonadism is significantly undertreated. A large study of 1,475 men between the ages of 30 and 79 years old revealed that the prevalence of hypogonadism is about 24%. Based on this prevalence rate and the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2019 estimate that there are 90.1 million men between 30 years old and 79 years old, approximately 21.6 million men in the U.S. may have low testosterone. In the study fewer than 4% of patients were receiving treatment for hypogonadism.
 
TRT’s have been commercially available in the United States for over 70 years and have followed a progression of delivery systems that included subcutaneous, or under-the-skin, injection, intramuscular injection, transdermal patch, topical gels, creams, subcutaneous-delivery injections, and finally orals which were launched in 2020. The difficulty in creating an easy to use/administer and clinically effective testosterone therapy is related to the molecule’s complex PK’s. PK’s describe how the body affects a specific drug after administration through the mechanism of absorption and distribution, as well as the chemical changes of the substance in the body. For example, oral therapies, require multiple, high daily doses due to low bioavailability. Bioavailability is the fraction of a drug dose that is actually absorbed into the bloodstream. Additionally, the few oral therapies that have been used in the United States previously quickly went out of favor after significant side effects were revealed, most notably liver toxicity.
 
Currently, the U.S. TRT market consists of therapies that exist in multiple forms:
 

· | gel/cream/patch;
--+-----------------


· | injectable;
--+------------


· | intranasal;
--+------------


· | buccal tablet, which is a tablet shaped patch applied to the upper gums; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | oral.
--+------

 
Historically transdermal patches and gel-based TRT were the most desirable application type, however currently injectables are the most prescribed.
 
The male testosterone market was $1.4 million in 2020 according to IMS Health data and based on wholesale acquisition costs (“WAC”). Additionally, testosterone replacement prescriptions were approximately 7.6 million in 2020 according to IMS Health data, a 6.8% growth over 2019 prescriptions. Injectables are the predominant dosage form in this market in terms of annual prescriptions written. The historical growth in the market was driven by increasing recognition by both patients and providers of the prevalence of hypogonadism and its far-reaching medical consequences. Additionally top TRT treatments were marketed by AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”) and Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) until the respective products went generic.
 
Product Candidates 
 
Our current portfolio includes our most advanced product candidate, TLANDO, an oral TRT product candidate, which received tentative approval from the FDA on December 8, 2020. TLANDO has not received final approval and is not eligible for final approval to market in the U.S. until the expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. with respect to Jatenzo®, which expires on March 27, 2022. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing our pipeline of other clinical candidates including an oral androgen therapy for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH, LPCN 1144, a next-generation potential once daily oral TRT, TLANDO XR, an androgen therapy for the treatment of NASH cirrhosis, LPCN 1148, and an oral therapy for the prevention of preterm birth, LPCN 1107.
 
These products are based on our proprietary Lip’ral drug delivery technology platform. Lip’ral technology is a patented technology based on lipidic compositions which form an optimal dispersed phase in the gastrointestinal environment for improved absorption of insoluble drugs. The drug loaded dispersed phase presents the solubilized drug efficiently at the absorption site (gastrointestinal tract membrane) thus improving the absorption process and making the drug less dependent on physiological variables such as dilution, gastro-intestinal pH and food effects for absorption. Lip’ral based formulation enables improved solubilization and higher drug-loading capacity, which can lead to improved bioavailability, reduced dose, faster and more consistent absorption, reduced variability, reduced sensitivity to food effects, improved patient compliance, and targeted lymphatic delivery where appropriate.

TLANDO: An Oral Product Candidate for Testosterone Replacement Therapy 
 
Our most advanced product, TLANDO, is an oral formulation of the chemical, TU, which is an eleven carbon side chain attached to T. TU is an ester prodrug of T. An ester is chemically formed by bonding an acid and an alcohol. Upon the cleavage, or breaking, of the ester bond, T is formed. TU has been approved for use outside the United States for many years for delivery via intra-muscular injection and in oral dosage form and more recently TU has received regulatory approval in the United States for delivery via intra-muscular injection and in oral dosage form. We are using our proprietary technology to facilitate steady gastrointestinal solubilization and absorption of TU. Proof of concept was initially established in 2006, and subsequently TLANDO was licensed in 2009 to Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which was then acquired by Abbott Products, Inc. ("Abbott"). Following a portfolio review associated with the spin-off of AbbVie by Abbott in 2011, the rights to TLANDO were reacquired by us. All obligations under the prior license agreement have been completed except that Lipocine will owe Abbott a perpetual 1% royalty on net sales. Such royalties are limited to $1 million in the first two calendar years following product launch, after which period there is not a cap on royalties and no maximum aggregate amount. If generic versions of any such product are introduced, then royalties are reduced by 50%.
NDA PDUFA Outcome
 
On December 8, 2020 we received tentative approval from the FDA regarding our NDA filed in February 2020 for TLANDO as a TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. In granting tentative approval, the FDA concluded that TLANDO has met all required quality, safety and efficacy standards necessary for approval. However, TLANDO has not received final approval and is not eligible for final approval to market in the U.S. until the expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. with respect to Jatenzo®, which expires on March 27, 2022. We are currently reviewing the FDA’s tentative approval of TLANDO and remain committed to taking appropriate actions with the goal of receiving final approval to permit the launch of TLANDO. Under the PREA, if TLANDO receives full approval, we will need to address the PREA requirement to assess the safety and effectiveness of TLANDO in pediatric patients. The FDA has also required us to conduct certain post-marketing studies including: (i) conduct an appropriately designed label comprehension study that assesses patient understanding of key risk messages in the Medication Guide for TLANDO and (ii) conduct an appropriately designed one-year trial to evaluate development of adrenal insufficiency with chronic TLANDO therapy. The timetables for these post-marketing requirements will be established at the time of full approval of TLANDO. We are currently evaluating multiple commercial alternatives with TLANDO, should it receive FDA approval, including out-licensing TLANDO to a third-party, launching TLANDO on our own, or launching TLANDO on our own with the assistance from a “risk share” partner.
Recent Competition Update
 
On March 27, 2019, Clarus’ product JATENZO®, an oral TU product, was approved by the FDA and also received three years of data exclusivity. On February 10, 2020, Clarus announced that JATENZO® has been launched and is commercially available. Based on the FDA’s tentative approval of TLANDO, we will not be able to begin marketing TLANDO until March 27, 2022, the expiration of the exclusivity period granted to Clarus with respect to JATENZO®.
 
Additionally, our competitors may introduce other T-replacement therapies. For example, on January 5, 2021 Marius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Marius”) submitted a NDA to the FDA seeking approval of KYZATREX®, its novel oral TU soft gelatin capsule for the treatment of primary and secondary hypogonadism in adult men.
 
We are also aware of other pharmaceutical companies that have T-replacement therapies or testosterone therapies in development that may be approved for marketing in the United States or outside of the United States.
 
Based on publicly available information, we believe that several other T-replacement therapies that would be competitive with TLANDO are in varying stages of development, some of which may be approved, marketed and/or commercialized prior to TLANDO. These therapies include T-gels, oral-T, an aromatase inhibitor, a new class of drugs called Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators and hydroalcoholic gel formulations of Dihydrotestosterone (“DHT”).

LPCN 1144: An Oral Prodrug of Bioidentical Testosterone Product Candidate for the Treatment of NASH
 
We are currently evaluating LPCN 1144, an oral prodrug of bioidentical testosterone comprised of TU, for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH. NASH is a more advanced state of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and can progress to a cirrhotic liver and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma/ liver cancer. Twenty to thirty percent of the U.S. population is estimated to suffer from NAFLD and fifteen to twenty percent of this group progress to NASH, which is a substantially large population that lacks effective therapy. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments for NASH, a silent killer that affects ~30 million Americans. Approximately 50% of NASH patients are in adult males and the number of NASH cases is projected to increase 63% from 16.5 million cases in 2015 to 27.0 million cases in 2030. NAFLD/NASH is becoming more common due to its strong correlation with obesity and metabolic syndrome, including components of metabolic syndrome such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. In men, especially with comorbidities associated with NAFLD/NASH, testosterone deficiency has been associated with an increased accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance, which could be factors contributing to NAFLD/NASH.
 
History of Liver Disease
 
The liver is the largest internal organ in the human body and its proper function is indispensable for many critical metabolic functions, including the regulation of lipid and sugar metabolism, the production of important proteins, including those involved in blood clotting, and purification of blood. There are over 100 described diseases of the liver, and because of its many functions, these can be highly debilitating and life-threatening unless effectively treated. Liver diseases can result from injury to the liver caused by a variety of insults, including hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), hepatitis B virus (“HBV”), obesity, chronic excessive alcohol use or autoimmune diseases. Regardless of the underlying cause of the disease, there are important similarities in the disease progression including increased inflammatory activity and excessive liver cell apoptosis, which if unresolved leads to fibrosis. Fibrosis, if allowed to progress, will lead to cirrhosis, or excessive scarring of the liver, and eventually reduced liver function. Some patients with liver cirrhosis have a partially functioning liver and may appear asymptomatic for long periods of time, which is referred to as decompensated liver disease. Decompensated liver disease is when the liver is unable to perform its normal functions. Many people with active liver disease remain undiagnosed largely because liver disease patients are often asymptomatic for many years.
Markers of Liver Cell Death
 
Alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) is an enzyme that is produced in liver cells and is naturally found in the blood of healthy individuals. In liver disease, liver cells are damaged and as a consequence, ALT is released into the blood, increasing ALT levels above the normal range. Physicians routinely test blood levels of ALT to monitor the health of a patient's liver. ALT level is a clinically important biochemical marker of the severity of liver inflammation and ongoing liver disease. Elevated levels of ALT represent general markers of liver cell death and inflammation without regard to any specific mechanism. Aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”) is a second enzyme found in the blood that is produced in the liver and routinely measured by physicians along with ALT. As with ALT, AST is often elevated in liver disease and, like ALT, is considered an overall marker of liver inflammation.
 
Relationship between Hypogonadism and NAFLD
 
Preclinical and clinical studies in the NAFLD/NASH literature have shown the prevalence of testosterone deficiency across the NAFLD/NASH histological spectrum wherein low testosterone was independently associated with NAFLD/NASH with an inverse relationship between testosterone and NAFLD/NASH symptom severity. A recent National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (“NIDDK”) report suggests that 75% of biopsy confirmed NASH subjects have less than 372 ng/dL of total testosterone and that the degree of fibrosis severity is inversely related to free testosterone levels; thus, providing a good rationale for testing LPCN 1144 in adult NASH patients regardless of their hypogonadal status. We have received clearance from the FDA to clinically investigate LPCN 1144 in an expanded target population of adult male NASH patients. Specifically, the FDA waived the limitation of only testing LPCN 1144 in NASH subjects with total testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL (threshold for hypogonadism).
 
Post hoc analyses of our existing clinical trials in subjects with comorbidities typically associated with NASH comorbidities indicate that testosterone therapy significantly and consistently reduced elevated levels of key serum biomarkers (liver function enzymes and serum triglyceride) generally associated with NAFLD/NASH.

Current Status
 
We have initiated the LiFT Phase 2 clinical study in confirmed non-cirrhotic NASH subjects. The LiFT clinical study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-arm study in biopsy-confirmed hypogonadal or eugonadal male NASH subjects with grade F1/F3 fibrosis and a NAFLD Activity Score (“NAS”) ≥ 4 with a 36-week treatment period. The LiFT clinical study enrolled 56 biopsy confirmed NASH male subjects. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three arms (Treatment A is a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent, Treatment B is a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent formulated with 217 mg of d-alpha tocopherol equivalent, and the third arm is twice daily matching placebo). We currently expect 36-week biopsy data will be available in the third quarter of 2021.
 
The primary endpoint of the LiFT clinical study is change in hepatic fat fraction via MRI-PDFF and exploratory liver fat/marker end points post 12 weeks of treatment. Additionally, key secondary endpoints post 36 weeks of treatment include assessment of histological change for NASH resolution and/or fibrosis improvement as well as liver fat data.
 
Additionally, subjects will have access to LPCN 1144 through an open label extension study. The extension study will enable the collection of additional data on LPCN 1144 for up to a total of 72 weeks of therapy
 
Treatments with LPCN 1144 post 12 weeks of treatment resulted in robust liver fat reduction, assessed by MRI-PDFF, and showed improvement of liver injury markers with no observed tolerability issues. Inclusion of d-alpha tocopherol formulated with the testosterone prodrug resulted in additional liver benefits, notably improved key liver markers without compromising tolerability.
 
Key results are presented in the following tables:

During the 12 weeks of treatment, the observed rate and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (“TEAEs”) in both the LPCN 1144 treatment arms were comparable to the placebo arm. Three subjects in the placebo group and one subject in the combined treatment arms discontinued study drug due to TEAEs. We currently expect 36-week biopsy data will be available in the third quarter of 2021.
 
Previous to the LiFT clinical study, we completed a 16-week POC liver imaging clinical study to assess liver fat changes in hypogonadal men at risk of developing NASH using MRI-PDFF technique. Treatment results from the POC liver imaging study demonstrated that 48% of the treated NAFLD subjects, defined as baseline liver fat of at least 5%, had NAFLD resolution, defined as liver fat <5% post treatment. Additionally, 100% of the subjects experiencing NAFLD resolution had at least a 35% relative liver fat reduction from baseline with a relative mean liver fat reduction of 55% in this group. Further results from the POC liver fat clinical study after 16 weeks of treatment are as follows:
 

Baseline Liver Fat % | Mean Liver Fat % at | | Relative Reductions at EOS | | Responder Rate** at 
---------------------+-------------------------+------+--------------------------------+----+------------------------
Category, n | Baseline | | Mean % | | Median % | EOS, % 
At least 10%, n=8 | | 20.5 | | 40 | | 39 | 75
At least 8%, n=10 | | 18.3 | | 42 | | 42 | 80
At least 5%, n=21 | | 12.1 | | 33 | | 41 | 71

 
**Based on subjects who experienced at least a 30% reduction in liver fat from baseline.
 
TLANDO XR: A Next-Generation Long-Acting Oral Product Candidate for TRT
 
TLANDO XR is a next-generation, novel ester prodrug of testosterone comprised of TT which uses the Lip’ral technology to enhance solubility and improve systemic absorption. We completed a Phase 2b dose finding study in hypogonadal men in the third quarter of 2016. The primary objectives of the Phase 2b clinical study were to determine the starting Phase 3 dose of TLANDO XR along with safety and tolerability of TLANDO XR and its metabolites following oral administration of single and multiple doses in hypogonadal men. The Phase 2b clinical trial was a randomized, open label, two-period, multi-dose PK study that enrolled hypogonadal males into five treatment groups. Each of the 12 subjects in a group received treatment for 14 days. Results of the Phase 2b study suggest that the primary objectives were met, including identifying the dose expected to be tested in a Phase 3 study. Good dose-response relationship was observed over the tested dose range in the Phase 2b study. Additionally, the target Phase 3 dose met primary and secondary end points. Overall, TLANDO XR was well tolerated with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events reported in the Phase 2b study.
 
Additionally in October 2014, we completed a Phase 2a POC study in hypogonadal men. The Phase 2a open-label, dose-escalating single and multiple dose study enrolled 12 males. Results from the Phase 2a clinical study demonstrated the feasibility of a once daily dosing with TLANDO XR in hypogonadal men and a good dose response. Additionally, the study confirmed that steady state is achieved by day 14 with consistent inter-day performance observed on day 14, 21 and 28. No subjects exceeded Cmax of 1500 ng/dL at any time during the 28-day dosing period on multi-dose exposure. Overall, TLANDO XR was well tolerated with no serious AE’s reported.
 
We have also completed a preclinical toxicology study with TLANDO XR in dogs.

In February 2018 we had a meeting with the FDA to discuss these pre-clinical results and to discuss the Phase 3 clinical study and path forward for TLANDO XR. Based on the results of the FDA meeting and additional pre-clinical trials conducted after the FDA meeting, we have proposed a Phase 3 protocol for TLANDO XR and have solicited FDA feedback. Based on initial FDA feedback, we expect the Phase 3 clinical trial design to follow the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) guidelines and will include a three-month efficacy treatment period and a one-year safety component for up to 100 subjects. We continue to refine the Phase 3 protocol and plan to request FDA approval of the protocol once it is finalized. Additionally, the FDA previously requested that a food effect study needs to be completed, and that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (“ABPM”) be included as part of the Phase 3 clinical study. We anticipate the next steps in developing TLANDO XR will be to scale up the formulation and conduct a food effect study with TLANDO XR. We are also exploring the possibility of licensing TLANDO XR to a third party, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by us.
 
LPCN 1148: An Oral Prodrug of Bioidentical Testosterone Product Candidate for the Treatment of Cirrhosis 
 
Cirrhosis is end-stage NAFLD for which there is no FDA approved drug treatment. Liver cirrhosis is estimated to affect in excess of 600,000 Americans, with men affected at twice the rate of women, and results in approximately 45,000 deaths every year. Due to a lack of available organs, only a third of waitlisted patients are getting liver transplants, and patients that do receive a transplant are increasingly being described as frail. Low testosterone affects up to 90% of cirrhotic men, and is a predictor of mortality and increased adverse events including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and clinically significant portal hypertension.
 
We are currently formulating plans to conduct a POC study in male cirrhotic subjects through consultations with the FDA and key opinion leaders to evaluate the therapeutic potential of LPCN 1148 for the treatment of cirrhotic subjects. On May 5, 2020 the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug application ("IND") to initiate a Phase 2 POC study to evaluate the therapeutic potential of LPCN 1148 for the treatment of liver cirrhosis in adult male cirrhotic patients. The planned Phase 2 clinical study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled 52-week study in male cirrhotic patients that are on the liver transplant list.
 
LPCN 1107: An Oral Product Candidate for the Prevention of Preterm Birth
 
We believe LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”) product indicated for the reduction of risk of preterm birth (delivery less than 37 weeks) (“PTB”) in women with singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous PTB. Prevention of PTB is a significant unmet need as approximately 11.7% of all U.S. pregnancies result in PTB, a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity.
 
We have completed a multi-dose PK dose selection study in pregnant women. The objective of the multi-dose PK selection study was to assess HPC blood levels in order to identify the appropriate LPCN 1107 Phase 3 dose. The multi-dose PK dose selection study was an open-label, four-period, four-treatment, randomized, single and multiple dose, PK study in pregnant women of three dose levels of LPCN 1107 and the injectable intramuscular ("IM") HPC (Makena®). The study enrolled 12 healthy pregnant women (average age of 27 years) with a gestational age of approximately 16 to 19 weeks. Subjects received three dose levels of LPCN 1107 (400 mg BID, 600 mg BID, or 800 mg BID) in a randomized, crossover manner during the first three treatment periods and then received five weekly injections of HPC during the fourth treatment period. During each of the LPCN 1107 treatment periods, subjects received a single dose of LPCN 1107 on Day 1 followed by twice daily administration from Day 2 to Day 8. Following completion of the three LPCN 1107 treatment periods and a washout period, all subjects received five weekly injections of HPC. Results from this study demonstrated that average steady state HPC levels (Cavg0-24) were comparable or higher for all three LPCN 1107 doses than for injectable HPC. Additionally, HPC levels as a function of daily dose were linear for the three LPCN 1107 doses. Also, unlike the injectable HPC, steady state exposure was achieved for all three LPCN 1107 doses within seven days. We have also completed a POC Phase 1b clinical study of LPCN 1107 in healthy pregnant women in January 2015 and a POC Phase 1a clinical study of LPCN 1107 in healthy non-pregnant women in May 2014. These studies were designed to determine the PK and bioavailability of LPCN 1107 relative to an IM HPC, as well as safety and tolerability.
 
A traditional pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (“PK/PD”) based Phase 2 clinical study in the intended patient population is not expected to be required prior to entering into Phase 3. Therefore, based on the results of our multi-dose PK study we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting and subsequent guidance meetings with the FDA to define a pivotal Phase 2b/3 development plan for LPCN 1107. However, these discussions will need to be updated based on recent developments with Covis Group’s (“Covis”) Makena®. We plan to resume our interactions with the FDA to discuss our pivotoal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial design and better understand next steps to advance LPCN 1107. Additionally, a pivotal Phase 2b/3 study will not occur until the results from a planned food-effect study with LPCN 1107 are reviewed by the FDA, though manufacturing scale-up work for LPCN 1107 has been completed.

We do not anticipate the initiation of a pivotal Phase 2b/3 study with LPCN 1107 to occur in 2021until additional clarity from the FDA is obtained with regards to Makena or the product candidate is out-licensed. We may conduct the required food effect clinical study in advance of receiving clarity on Makena. We are also exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1107 to a third party, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on acceptable terms.
 
The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to LPCN 1107 based on a major contribution to patient care. Orphan designation qualifies Lipocine for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the prescription drug user fee when we file our NDA.
 
Recent Competition Update
 
On October 5, 2020, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) proposed that Makena be withdrawn from the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not show Makena is effective for its approved use. Upon withdrawal of Makena, the FDA would also withdraw all abbreviated new drug applications for drug products containing hydroxyprogesterone caproate that reference Makena as their referenced listed drug. CDER issued AMAG, the NDA holder at the time, a notice of an opportunity for a hearing (“NOOH”) to withdraw approval of Makena, for which AMAG responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company’s position, recognizing clinicians’ decade-long use of Makena’s treatment and the public health implications of withdrawing approval.  The FDA Commissioner granted a hearing, and the process is expected to take months. During this time, Makena and the approved generics of Makena will remain on the market until the FDA makes a final decision about these products.
 
Currently, Makena and the approved generics of Makena are the only products approved for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth.
 
The FDA also indicated that it intends to hold a meeting with experts in obstetrics, neonatal care, and clinical trial design to discuss how to facilitate development of effective and safe therapies to treat preterm birth.
 
Research and Development
 
We currently have five products in our development pipeline (TLANDO, LPCN 1144, TLANDO XR, LPCN 1148 and LPCN 1107) and we continue to conceptualize and discuss new indications for current products as well as new development opportunities. In 2020 and 2019, we spent $9.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively, on research and development.
Competition 
 
Testosterone Market Overview 
 
The gel-based testosterone replacement products that are currently available include AbbVie’s AndroGel® , Lilly’s Axiron® Topical Solution and Endo’s Testim® and Fortesta® along with their respective authorized generics as well as the equivalent generic versions of each. Transdermal patches include Allergan’s Androderm®. Intramuscular forms of testosterone also exist although commercialized mostly in generic forms by multiple companies and in branded form as Aveed® by Endo. Additionally, Endo markets the buccal testosterone replacement therapy Striant® and the Testopel® implantable testosterone pellets, which it acquired from Auxillium in 2015. Antares Pharma, Inc. markets a sub-cutaneous weekly auto-injector testosterone therapy, Xyosted™. Aytu BioScience Inc. markets an intranasal testosterone therapy, Natesto®, which it licensed from Acerus Pharmaceuticals in 2016. Finally, Clarus markets an oral TRT, JATENZO®, which received approval in March 2019.
 
Currently, intramuscular injections have the highest market share in the testosterone replacement market in terms of annual prescriptions. While gels are also widely-used form of TRT, there is a risk of transference; additionally, the gels are messy to apply and have significant compliance issues leading to high rates of discontinuance among patients. Additionally, certain intramuscular injections have the potential to cause pulmonary embolisms as well as cause injection site reactions, scarring, pain and risk of infection in patients. We believe a safe and effective oral therapy could potentially increase patient convenience and compliance, while eliminating the testosterone transference risk associated with gels and injection site reaction of injectables.
 
The FDA has granted a therapeutic equivalence rating of AB to “generic” versions of approved products which have been approved via a 505(b)(2) NDA. In July 2014, FDA granted the AB rating to Perrigo’s 1% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 203098) approved in January 2013, and a BX rating to Teva’s 1% gel drug product (NDA 202763) approved in February 2012. Each are versions of AbbVie’s AndroGel 1.0% and employed 505(b)(2) submissions citing AndroGel as their reference listed drugs. Teva’s version was found to be bioinequivalent to AndroGel, hence the BX rating. Upsher-Smith Laboratories also received approval for a version of Endo’s Testim (Vogelxo™; NDA 204399) in June 2014 using the same pathway. In January of 2015, the FDA determined that Vogelxo™ is therapeutically equivalent to Testim and received an AB rating. In August 2015, the FDA granted AB rating to Perrigo’s 1.62% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 204268) which also received FDA approval in August 2015. Lilly and Acrux’s Axiron had patent expiry in February 2017. On July 6, 2017, Acrux confirmed that a generic version of Axiron® Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL (Testosterone Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL) has been launched in the United States by Perrigo Company plc. Acrux also confirmed the availability of an authorized generic version of Axiron in the United States, through a marketing and distribution agreement between Lilly and Company and a leading authorized generics company

Other Therapies in Development 
 
Recently there has been increased interest in developing oral TRT’s therapies as well as testosterone therapies which are not considered testosterone replacement and as such will need to achieve efficacy endpoints in addition to endpoints related to serum testosterone levels that are required for testosterone replacement therapies.
 
Marius is developing an oral TU as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypogonadism in men as well as in the treatment of Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty in adolescent boys (14-17 years of age). Marinus submitted a NDA to the FDA in January 2021 for its product, Kyzatrex™, its novel oral TU soft gelatin capsule for the treatment of hypogonadism in adult men.
 
Mereo BioPharma Group Ltd. is currently developing BGS649, a once weekly aromatase inhibitor, for first-line therapy for the treatment of male infertility associated with  hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (“HH”).
 
TesoRx Pharma LLC is developing an oral bio-identical testosterone, TSX-002, for the treatment of Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty. Phase 2 clinical studies have been conducted. TesoRx is also developing a potential once-daily oral TU product candidate, TSX-049, as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypogonadism in men. TSX-049 is still in pre-clinical development.
 
NASH Market Overview 
 
There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH. However, various therapeutics are used off-label for the treatment of NASH, including vitamin E (an antioxidant), insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone), antihyperlipidemic agents (e.g., gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and ursodeoxycholic acid. There are several product candidates in Phase 3 or earlier clinical or preclinical development for the treatment of NASH, including FGF21 Stimulants such as BIO89-100 (89bio), Efruxifermin (EFX; Akero Therapeutics), Pegbelfermin (Bristol Myers Squibb/Ambrx Inc.); FGF19 Analog:Aldafermin (NGM Biopharmaceuticals); FXR Agonists: Tropifexor (Novartis), EDP-305 (Enata Pharmaceuticals), PXL007/EYP001 (Poxel/Enyo Pharma:) Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Agonist: Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk); Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor (PPAR) Regulator: Lanifibranor (Inventiva);THR-β Agonis:t VK2809 (Viking Therapeutics), and Resmetirom (Madrigal Pharmaceuticals).
 
Additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of NASH include AstraZeneca plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc., Durect Corporation, Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Immuron Ltd., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Islet Sciences, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., MiNA Therapeutics, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S, NuSirt Sciences Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc. and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. NASH is a complex disease and we believe that it is unlikely that any one therapeutic option will be optimal for every NASH patient.

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, or HPC, Preterm Birth, or PTB, Market Overview 
 
PTB is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. The only approved therapy for prevention of PTB in women with a prior history of at least one preterm birth (~180,000 pregnancies annually) is a weekly intramuscular injection of HPC, marketed by Covis under the brand name Makena®. The FDA granted a 7-year orphan drug exclusivity to Makena in February 2011 because the product is intended to treat “rare diseases or conditions” defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States which expired in February 2018. Generic versions of the intermuscular injection of Makena became available during 2018. In order to protect market share, Covis also developed a subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena that received FDA approval on February 14, 2018. Treatment with Makena is initiated in pregnant women between week 16 and week 20 of pregnancy and is continued until up to delivery or week 37, whichever is earlier. The intramuscular injection is administered by a healthcare provider using a 21-gauge needle into the gluteus muscle, alternating sides each week. The intramuscular injections are associated with significant pain, discomfort and associated injection site reactions. The subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena eliminates the need to travel weekly to a healthcare provider to have the injection administered. Covis has disclosed that the completed confirmatory trial for Makena did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms for the co-primary endpoints of reducing the risk of recurrent preterm birth or improving neonatal mortality and morbidity. On October 29, 2019 a Meeting of the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee was held to consider the trial’s findings and the sNDA in the context of AMAG Pharmaceuticals’ confirmatory study obligation. While the committee discussed multiple questions, in a mixed vote on the key question, nine advisory committee members voted to recommend that the FDA pursue withdrawal of approval for Makena and seven committee members voted to leave the product on the market under accelerated approval and require a new confirmatory trial.  Among the clinicians on the advisory committee, five of the six who practice obstetrics voted to keep Makena on the market and generate more data. On October 5, 2020, the FDA’s CDER proposed that Makena be withdrawn from the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not show Makena is effective for its approved use.
 
CDER issued AMAG, the NDA holder at the time, a NOOH to withdraw approval of Makena, for which AMAG Pharmaceuticals responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company’s position, recognizing clinicians’ decade-long use of Makena’s treatment and the public health implications of withdrawing approval.  The FDA Commissioner granted a hearing, and the process is expected to take months. During this time, Makena and the approved generics of Makena will remain on the market until the FDA makes a final decision about these products.
 
Covis, formerly AMAG Pharmaceuticals, acquired Makena from Lumara Health Inc. in November 2014 for an upfront consideration of $675.0 million ($600.0 million in cash and $75.0 million in AMAG Pharmaceuticals stock) and additional contingent consideration of up to $350.0 million based on achievement of certain sales milestones.
 
Manufacturing Agreement 
 
On March 3, 2016, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing Services and Supply Agreement (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) with M.W. Encap Ltd. (“Encap”), a United Kingdom based contract manufacturer, a division of Capsugel Dosage Form Solutions which is a subsidiary of Lonza. On January 19, 2021, Lonza announced that it plans to sell its Encap site to European pharmaceutical contract manufacturer NextPharma, Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, Encap has agreed to manufacture and supply bulk commercial quantities of TLANDO. From the effective date of the Manufacturing Agreement through the fifth anniversary of the date that FDA approval is obtained for the sale and marketing of TLANDO in the United States unless earlier terminated, we have agreed to purchase a minimum of TLANDO on an annual basis from Encap once we receive commercial approval on the basis of a 12-month rolling commercial forecast in which the first 3 months of each rolling forecast are binding on us. Such forecast may be subsequently increased or decreased by us pursuant to the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement.
 
In general, we may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement without incurring any fees or costs upon 90 days written notice or immediately if Encap is not able to meet our reasonable requirements of TLANDO. We and Encap may each terminate the Manufacturing Agreement upon a material breach of the Manufacturing Agreement by the other party, so long as the other party has not cured such breach within a defined period after written notice of the breach by the non-breaching party or in the event the other party becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership. Encap may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement if we have not placed a firm order for TLANDO within a defined period of time from the date of FDA approval of TLANDO. Additionally, Encap may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement without cause upon the provision of written notice within a defined period of time advance written notice.
 
Additionally, we entered into an Agreement for the Manufacture of TU Liquid Fill Capsules and the Conduct of an ICH Stability Study in Support of Product Registration with Encap pursuant to which Encap manufactured and supplied to us a total of six lots of TLANDO capsules under current good manufacturing practices. These lots were used in Lipocine’s Phase 3 study for TLANDO. If Encap is unable to produce sufficient capsules for our future clinical trials or to support demand for TLANDO if it becomes commercially available, our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected.

We also hold license rights in fields other than cough and cold, to 2 U.S. patents and 1 U.S. applications (and related foreign patents and applications) that we previously assigned to Spriaso LLC, which could be possibly used with future product candidates.
 
We currently do not have patent protection for TLANDO in many countries, including territories such as India, Russia, and China, and we will be unable to prevent patent infringement in those countries unless we can file patent applications and obtain patents in those countries that cover TLANDO. Additionally, we multiple U.S. patents that could be listed in the FDA Orange Book for TLANDO that are expected to expire in 2029 and 2030. If we are marketing the TLANDO product at the time the patents expire and have no other issued U.S. patents covering the product, then we will lose certain advantages that come with FDA Orange Book listing of patents and will no longer be able to prevent others in the U.S. from practicing the inventions claimed by the 6 patents.
 
We expect to file new patent applications in the future in an attempt to further cover to various aspects of our products and product development.
 
See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, for a discussion of intellectual property related legal proceedings.

Government Regulation 
 
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development 
 
The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drugs and products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable law requires licensing and registration of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices, or GLP, good clinical practices, or GCP, during clinical testing and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, during production is required. The system of new drug approval in the United States is generally considered to be the most rigorous in the world and is described in further detail below under “United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process.”
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. The testing, production, sale, and promotion of pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
It takes many years for a typical experimental drug to go from concept to approval. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
 

· | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies. The latter often conducted according to GLPs or other applicable regulations, as well as synthesis and drug formulation development leading ultimately to clinical drug supplies manufactured according to cGMPs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
· | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use; 
· | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product; 
· | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
· | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
· | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and FDA approval is inherently uncertain.
 
15

 

Preclinical Studies: Prior to preclinical studies, a research phase takes place which involves demonstration of target and function, design, screening and synthesis of agonists or antagonists. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, PKs and metabolism of the pharmaceutical product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. The conduct of the preclinical safety evaluations must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The results of the formal IND-enabling preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature as well as the comprehensive descriptions of proposed human clinical studies, are then submitted as part of the IND application to the FDA.
 
The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.
 
Clinical Trials: Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trials: Phase 1 clinical trials are usually first-in-man trials, take approximately one to two years to complete and are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug’s activity, schedule and dose, PKs and pharmacodynamics. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials: Phase 2 clinical trials can take approximately one to three years to complete and are carried out on a relatively small to moderate number of patients (as compared to Phase 3) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, PKs, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. This phase also provides additional safety data and serves to identify possible common short-term side effects and risks in a larger group of patients. Phase 2 clinical trials sometimes include randomization of patients.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Phase 3 clinical trials take approximately two to five years to complete and involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These studies usually include randomization of patients and blinding of both patients and investigators at geographically dispersed test sites (multi-center trials). These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process 
 
New Drug Application: Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission or application is then reviewed by the regulatory body for approval to market the product. This process typically takes eight months to one year to complete. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Orphan Drug Designation 
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with the FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with the FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
The 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law No. 144-255) was enacted on December 13, 2016. This sweeping legislation makes significant changes to the way that FDA approves new drugs and medical devices. Among other things, the legislation calls on FDA to consider new types of data, such as patient experience data, in its drug approval process. The legislation also permits drug manufacturers to utilize new types of clinical trial designs in order to collect data in the drug approval process. The intent of many of the statute’s provisions are to speed the approval of new drugs and medical devices. Whether the 21st Century Cures Act realizes these goals will depend on the adoption of new FDA regulations, policy guidance and FDA approval practices, many of which the agency has not yet proposed or issued.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including, but not limited, to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the United States government, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, our Company, including our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, among others, must comply with federal healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, healthcare fraud and false statement provisions and data privacy and security provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and any analogous state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (“OBRA”), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”) substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, ACA establishes: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.
 
Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including fraud and abuse, privacy and transparency laws.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of insurers and managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.

The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less-costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 
The United States Orphan Drug Act encourages the development of orphan drugs, which are intended to treat “rare diseases or conditions” within the meaning of this Act (i.e., those that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States). The provisions of the Act are intended to stimulate the research, development and approval of products that treat rare diseases. Orphan Drug Designation provides a sponsor with several potential benefits: (1) sponsors may be granted seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval of the orphan-designated indication for the drug product; (2) sponsors are granted U.S. tax incentives for clinical research; (3) the FDA’s office of orphan products development coordinates research study design assistance for sponsors of drugs for rare diseases; and (4) grant funding can be obtained to defray costs of qualified clinical testing.
 
Priority Review 
 
Priority Review is a designation for an NDA after it has been submitted to the FDA for review. Reviews for NDAs are designated as either “Standard” or “Priority.” A Standard designation sets the target date for completing all aspects of a review and the FDA taking an action on 90% of applications (i.e., approve or not approve) at 12 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 10 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered non-new molecular entities. A Priority designation sets the target date for the FDA action on 90% of applications at eight months after submission submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 6 months after submission for drugs considered non-new molecular entities. A Priority designation is intended for those products that address unmet medical needs. Accelerated Approval 
 
Accelerated Approval or Subpart H Approval is a program described in the NDA regulations that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint prior to formal demonstration of patient benefit. A surrogate marker is a measurement intended to substitute for the clinical measurement of interest, usually prolongation of survival in oncology that is considered likely to predict patient benefit. The approval that is granted may be considered a provisional approval with a written commitment to complete clinical studies that formally demonstrate patient benefit.

Related Party Transaction
 
On July 23, 2013, we entered into assignment/license and services agreements with Spriaso, an entity that is majority-owned by Mahesh V. Patel, Gordhan Patel, John W. Higuchi, Dr. William I. Higuchi, and their affiliates. Mahesh V. Patel is our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Higuchi is a member of our Board of Directors and Gordhan Patel and Dr. Higuchi, former Board members, were each members of our Board of Directors at the date the license and agreements were entered into.
 
Under the assignment agreement, we assigned and transferred to Spriaso all of our rights, title and interest in our intellectual property for the cough and cold field. In addition, Spriaso was assigned all rights and obligations under our product development agreement with a co-development partner. In exchange, we would be entitled to receive a potential cash royalty of 20% of the net proceeds received by Spriaso, up to a maximum of $10 million. Spriaso also granted back to us an exclusive license to such intellectual property to develop products outside of the cough and cold field. The assignment agreement will expire upon the expiration of all of Spriaso’s payment obligations thereunder and the expiration of all of the licensed patents thereunder. Spriaso has the right to terminate the assignment agreement with 30 days written notice. We have the right to terminate the assignment agreement upon the complete liquidation or dissolution of Spriaso, unless the assignment agreement is assigned to an affiliate or successor of Spriaso.
 
Under the services agreement, we will provide facilities and up to 10% of the services of certain employees to Spriaso for a period of up to 18 months which expired January 23, 2015. Effective January 23, 2015, we entered into an amended services agreement with Spriaso in which we agreed to continue providing up to 10% of the services of certain employees to Spriaso at a rate of $230/hour for a period of six months. The agreement was further amended on July 23, 2015, on January 23, 2016, on July 23, 2016 on January 23, 2017, on July 23, 2017, on January 23, 2018, on July 23, 2018 and again on January 23, 2019 to extend the term of the agreement for an additional six months. The agreement was further amended on July 23, 2019 and again on July 23, 2020 to extend the term of the agreement for an additional twelve months. The agreement may be extended upon written agreement of Spriaso and us. Additionally, Spriaso filed its first NDA in 2014, and as an affiliated entity of Lipocine, it used up the one-time waiver of user fees for a small business submitting its first human drug application to FDA.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 11 full time employees and we also utilize the services of consultants on a regular basis. Six employees are engaged in drug development activities and five are in general and administration functions and all of our employees work out of our Salt Lake City facility. The Company continually evaluates the business need and opportunity and balances in house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and certain drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers.  None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We strive toward having a diverse team of employees and are committed to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity.
