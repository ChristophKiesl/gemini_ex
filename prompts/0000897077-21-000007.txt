Item 1. Business 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “the Company,”  “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Alamo Group Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

General

The Company is a leader in the design and manufacture of high quality agricultural equipment and infrastructure maintenance equipment for governmental and industrial use. The Company’s products include tractor-mounted mowing and other vegetation maintenance equipment, street sweepers, excavators, vacuum trucks, forestry and tree maintenance equipment, snow removal equipment, leaf collection equipment, pothole patchers, zero turn radius mowers, agricultural implements and related aftermarket parts. The Company emphasizes high quality, cost-effective products for its customers and strives to develop and market innovative products while constantly monitoring and seeking to contain its manufacturing and overhead costs. The Company has a long-standing strategy of supplementing its internal growth through acquisitions of businesses or product lines that currently complement, command, or have the potential to achieve a meaningful share of their niche markets. 
The Company has approximately 3,990 employees and operates a total of 27 plants in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. The Company sells its products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors to governmental end-users, related independent contractors, as well as to the agricultural and commercial turf markets. The primary markets for our products are North America, South America, Europe and Australia.

 The predecessor corporation to Alamo Group Inc. was incorporated in the State of Texas in 1969, as a successor to a business that began selling mowing equipment in 1955, and Alamo Group Inc. was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1987.
History
 Since its founding in 1969, the Company has focused on satisfying customer needs through geographic market expansion, product development and refinement, and selected acquisitions. The Company’s first products were based on rotary cutting technology. Through acquisitions, the Company added flail cutting technology in 1983 and sickle-bar cutting technology in 1984. The Company added to its presence in the industrial and governmental vegetation markets with the acquisition of Tiger Corporation (“Tiger”) in late 1994.
 The Company entered the agricultural mowing markets in 1986 with the acquisition of Rhino Products Inc. (“Rhino”), a leading manufacturer in this field. With this acquisition, the Company embarked on a strategy to increase the Rhino dealer distribution network during a period of industry contraction. The addition of M&W Gear Company (“M&W”) in early 1995 allowed the Company to enter into the manufacturing and distribution of tillage equipment, which complements the Rhino distribution network. M&W is part of the agricultural marketing group. 
 In 1991, the Company began its international expansion with the acquisition of McConnel Ltd. (“McConnel”), a United Kingdom (“U.K.”) manufacturer of vegetation maintenance equipment, principally hydraulic boom-mounted hedge and grass cutters and related parts. Bomford-Turner Ltd. (“Bomford”), also a U.K. company, was acquired in 1993. Bomford is a manufacturer of heavy-duty, tractor-mounted grass and hedge mowing equipment. McConnel and Bomford sell their products to dealers and distributors through their respective sales forces.

Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak a global pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world and has negatively impacted portions of the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created volatility in financial markets. COVID-19 caused government authorities around the world to implement stringent measures to attempt to help control the spread of the virus, including business shutdowns and curtailments, travel restrictions, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, quarantines, "shelter-in-place" and "stay-at-home" orders, curfews, social distancing, and other measures. The adverse global economic impact of this pandemic negatively and materially impacted our business, customers, and suppliers and caused many challenges for our business and manufacturing operations during 2020. The Company continues to experience negative impacts of COVID-19 on our markets and operations as well as ongoing business uncertainty. The full extent to which COVID-19 will adversely impact the Company’s business depends on future developments, potential new virus strains or variations, and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or limit the spread of the virus, including the impact of vaccines. Additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business can be found under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and risks related to COVID-19 can be found under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Products and Distribution Channels
At the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company began reporting operating results on the basis of two segments: the Industrial Division and the Agricultural Division. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company had been reporting its operating results on the basis of three segments which included the Company's European Division. The Company's European Division was a mixture of industrial and agricultural products similar to those within our other two segments. We believe that by combining similar products under two reporting segments, each operating globally, we will achieve better alignment of our products along functional lines, which will allow the Company to operate more efficiently.

Replacement Parts
The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of replacement parts for each of its wholegoods lines. Replacement parts represented approximately 21%, 19% and 19% of the Company’s total sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Replacement parts generally are more profitable and less cyclical than wholegoods.
Product Development
The Company’s ability to provide innovative responses to customer needs, to develop and manufacture new products, and to enhance existing product lines is important to its success. The Company continually conducts research and development activities in an effort to improve existing products and develop new products. As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 261 people in its various engineering departments, 174 of whom are degreed engineers and the balance of whom are support staff. Amounts expended on research and development activities were approximately $12.4 million in 2020, $12.0 million in 2019 and $10.4 million in 2018. As a percentage of sales, research and development was approximately 1.1% in 2020, 1.1% in 2019 and 1.0% in 2018, and is expected to continue at similar levels in 2021. 
Seasonality
 The Company’s unit sales are fairly constant quarter to quarter. However, replacement parts are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company’s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping. Usage of this equipment is typically lower in harsh weather. The Company utilizes an annual twelve-month sales forecast provided by the Company’s marketing departments which is updated quarterly in order to develop a production plan for its manufacturing facilities. In addition, many of the Company’s marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms.
Competition
The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation. The Company competes with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products, mainly on a regional basis. Some of the Company’s competitors are significantly larger than the Company and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal. The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company’s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company’s markets.
Unfilled Orders
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had unfilled customer orders of $354.1 million compared to $261.0 million at December 31, 2019. Management expects that substantially all of the Company’s unfilled orders as of December 31, 2020 will be shipped during fiscal year 2021. The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company’s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers. It is possible that unanticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain disruptions or customer issues could continue to cause delays in delivery or an inability to complete unfilled customer orders. The Company’s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments. No single customer or group of customers is responsible for 10% or more of the aggregate revenue of the Company or of a segment of the Company.
Sources of Supply
The principal raw materials used by the Company include steel, other metal components, hydraulic hoses, paint and tires. During 2020, the raw materials needed by the Company were available from a variety of sources in adequate quantities and at prevailing market prices.

While the Company manufactures many of the parts for its products, a significant percentage of parts, including most drivelines, gearboxes, industrial engines, and hydraulic components, are purchased from outside suppliers 
which manufacture to the Company’s specifications. In addition, the Company, through its subsidiaries, purchases tractors and truck chassis as a number of the Company’s products are mounted and shipped with a tractor or truck chassis. Tractors and truck chassis are generally available, but some delays in receiving tractors or truck chassis can occur throughout the year. The Company sources its purchased goods from international and domestic suppliers. No one supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the principal raw materials or purchased goods used by the Company. 

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names

 The Company owns various U.S. and international patents, trademarks and trade names. While the Company considers its patents, trademarks and trade names to be advantageous to its business, it is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, trade name or group of patents, trademarks, or trade names. The net book value of patents, trademarks and trade names was $89.2 million and $94.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
 Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company’s facilities and off-site disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future. Like other industrial concerns, the Company’s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.

 Certain assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time. The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety. A variety of state laws regulate the Company’s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements. The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
Human Capital Resources and Management 
 We recognize that the success of our Company is dependent upon the talents and dedication of our employees, and we are committed to investing in their success. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. We conduct regular assessments of our pay and benefit practices to help ensure that staff members are compensated fairly and competitively. We also devote significant resources to staff training and development, including tuition assistance for career-enhancing academic and professional programs. The Company provides competitive compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, our compensation programs, which vary by country and region, can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, company-sponsored retirement savings plans with employee matching opportunities (or similar local retirement benefit), healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. 
Employee health and safety is of paramount importance to us. We believe it is our responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy workplace in each of our facilities and to make continuous improvements in this area. We do this by embedding safety into every level of the organization as one of our core values. We ensure that safety performance is tracked, aggregated, and reviewed on an ongoing basis. Our corporate technical affairs and safety team collects data on recordable injury rates, serious injury rates, and near misses from each Alamo Group company, and conducts root cause analysis with corrective action to prevent future occurrences. This data is reviewed monthly by the executive leadership team and shared with the Company's Board of Directors on a 
quarterly basis. Regular safety meetings are also held at our facilities on an ongoing basis. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we immediately responded by prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees, and all of our facilities quickly adapted to the COVID-19 environment by implementing various health and safety measures including COVID-19 case tracking and quarantining where and when necessary, daily temperature checks, mandating face coverings (except where hazardous), regular facility sanitization, widely distributing hand-sanitizer, reconfiguration of workstations to allow for appropriate distancing, expanding the use of internal video meetings and installation of related technology, and implementing remote work policies, among other things. 
The Company's focus on supervisor and manager development and a culture of promoting a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace supports our ability to attract, engage, and retain industry-leading talent to meet our customer’s needs and sustain the Company’s growth. Formal welder training, apprenticeships, and local partnerships with vocational training programs, junior colleges, and high schools ensure our business units continue to attract and grow their critical manufacturing skills. The Company’s emphasis on our core competencies, including Leading People and Leading Change, continues to favorably impact our employee retention with below industry average annual turnover rates.
Employee engagement and development is another important focus for the Company. We believe in empowering our employees to develop new ideas, create new products, processes, or services, or solve significant organizational or industry problems through continuous improvement and innovation. We continuously offer employees relevant training and learning opportunities for advancement and growth.
We also recognize, value, and respect the individual differences of our employees and believe that a diverse set of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives is crucial to our ability to continue to innovate, collaborate, and meet the needs of our global workforce and customers. Accordingly, we are committed to encouraging and fostering an inclusive culture where diversity and individual differences are accepted, respected, and valued, and that employees feel empowered to contribute fully to the Company's ongoing success.
