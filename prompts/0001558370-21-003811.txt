ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
BUSINESS
We are a commercial stage pharmaceuticals company focused on developing novel, plant-based, non-opioid, and sustainably derived prescription medicines for people and animals with GI distress, specifically chronic, debilitating diarrhea. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Napo”), focuses on developing and commercializing proprietary plant-based human gastrointestinal pharmaceuticals for the global marketplace from plants used traditionally in rainforest areas. Our marketed drug Mytesi (crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets) is a product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy and the only oral plant-based botanical prescription medicine approved under FDA Botanical Guidance. 
Jaguar was founded in San Francisco, California as a Delaware corporation on June 6, 2013. Napo formed Jaguar to develop and commercialize animal health products. Effective as of December 31, 2013, Jaguar was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Napo, and Jaguar was a majority-owned subsidiary of Napo until the close of our initial 

1




public offering on May 18, 2015. On July 31, 2017, the merger of Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. and Napo became effective, at which point Jaguar Animal Health’s name changed to Jaguar Health, Inc. and Napo began operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jaguar focused on human health and the ongoing commercialization of Mytesi, and development of follow-on indications for, crofelemer. Most of the activities of the Company are now focused on the commercialization of Mytesi and development of follow-on indications for crofelemer and a second-generation anti-secretory product, lechlemer, that has yet to be approved by the FDA. In the field of animal health, we have limited activities which are focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class gastrointestinal products for dogs, dairy calves, foals, and high value horses.
We believe Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value adding benefits—an expanded pipeline of potential blockbuster human follow-on indications of crofelemer, and a second-generation anti-secretory agent, as well as a pipeline of potential animal health indications for crofelemer—upon which to build global partnerships. As previously announced, Jaguar, through Napo, now holds extensive global rights for Mytesi, and crofelemer manufacturing is being conducted at a multimillion-dollar commercial manufacturing facility. Additionally, several of the drug product candidates in Jaguar’s crofelemer pipeline are backed by what we believe are strong Phase 2 clinical proof of concept evidence from completed human clinical trials.
Mytesi is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect, acting locally in the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders that cause diarrhea. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including cancer therapy-related diarrhea (“CTD”); orphan-
drug indications for symptomatic relief of diarrhea in infants and children with congenital diarrheal disorders (“CDD”) and for adult and pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome (“SBS”); and for supportive care for diarrhea relief in inflammatory bowel diseases (“IBD”); diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS-D”); and for idiopathic/functional diarrhea. Additionally, the Company is exploring the conditional marketing authorization regulatory pathway in Europe to support development and commercialization of crofelemer for a proposed indication of diarrhea in acutely infected COVID-19 patients. Subsequent clinical studies may also be conducted in post COVID recovery patients suffering from “long-hauler” syndrome. A second-generation proprietary anti-secretory agent, lechlemer, is undergoing development for symptomatic relief of diarrhea resulting from cholera. Crofelemer has previously also received an orphan-drug designation for treatment of diarrhea associated with SBS. 
Napo has a direct sales force of 9 sales representatives and a national sales director covering U.S. geographies with the highest commercial potential. In November 2019, we hired Ian Wendt, a seasoned industry veteran with a broad range of experience that includes commercializing supportive care and HIV treatments, as Vice President of Commercial Strategy. He was promoted to Chief Commercial Officer in 2020. With support provided by concomitant marketing, promotional activities, patient education programs and peer education initiatives described below, we expect continued growth in the number of patients treated with Mytesi. Mr. Wendt will lead business development initiatives that pave the way for crofelemer’s final development for the cancer therapy-related diarrhea (“CTD”) market and our commercial role for this next important, potential indication for Mytesi. 
The goal of Napo’s internal sales team is to deliver a frequent and consistent selling message to targeted, high-volume prescribers of antiretroviral therapies (“ART”) and to gastroenterologists who see large numbers of HIV patients. In 2017 we released the results of a survey of 350 people living with HIV and AIDS regarding the topic of “Talking to Your Doctor About Symptoms.” The survey results show that diarrhea remains prevalent in those living with HIV/AIDS, with 27% of respondents reporting that they currently have diarrhea, and 56% reporting that they have had diarrhea in the past. Additionally, the results of a 2017 Napo-sponsored survey of 271 U.S. board certified gastroenterologists indicate that the number one GI complaint for people living with HIV/AIDS is diarrhea, and 93% of U.S. gastroenterologists see patients with HIV/AIDS in their practice.
Key to the success of our sales representatives in growing Mytesi sales is differentiating and targeting the right doctors—those HIV specialists who are high prescribers of ART and those gastrointestinal doctors who see large populations of people living with HIV/AIDS. The target list of prescribers for our sales reps includes a pool of approximately 1,300 high volume ART prescribing HIV specialists, and gastroenterologists who see the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDs, and we’ve strategically focused our sales force in the US geographies with the highest potential, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Seattle, southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Florida,

Medical education presentations led by health care providers (“HCPs”) participating in the Napo Speakers Bureau—a group that includes HIV/AIDS specialists, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, nurse practitioners, doctors of pharmacology, and physician assistants—focus on the prevalence and pathophysiology of gastrointestinal consequences of HIV infection and on the latest treatment options for HIV-related diarrhea. Presentations given by patient advocate members provide information to HIV/AIDS patients about the prevalence of diarrhea in people living with HIV/AIDS (“PLWHA”) and offer guidance about talking to HCPs regarding diarrhea-related concerns.
With the introduction of newer antiretroviral (“ARV”) drug therapy, there has been a reduction in the severity of ARV-induced diarrhea. However, a significant portion of this patient population still suffers from diarrhea caused by HIV enteropathy, which is due to the direct and indirect effects of HIV on the intestinal mucosa. Chronic diarrhea remains a significant complaint of PLWHA, particularly those who are older and have lived with the virus in their gut for 10+ years. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, currently more than 70% of people living with HIV are over age 50.
Napo is on many AIDS Drug Assistance Program (“ADAP”) formularies. ADAPs provide life-saving HIV treatments to low income, uninsured, and underinsured individuals living with HIV/AIDS in all 50 states and the territories. The ADAP program provides Mytesi free of charge to patients who qualify and copay support for some patients who have insurance coverage. Based on data from healthcare research firm Decision Resource Group, approximately 86% of ADAP-eligible US lives now have access to Mytesi, which is now on the ADAP formularies for 30 states, including the five programs with the largest enrollment. 
Napo has an agreement with the ADAP Crisis Task Force. The agreement establishes a reduced price provided by Napo to ADAPs in all U.S. states for purchases of Mytesi. Formed in 2002, the Task Force negotiates reduced drug prices for all ADAPs. Task Force membership is currently comprised of representatives from Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington state HIV/AIDS divisions. Per the terms of the agreement, all state ADAPs are guaranteed the same reduced price for the drug. ADAPs provide HIV related services and approved medications to more than half a million people in the U.S. each year, and we expect this agreement to help further expand the number of patients able to benefit from the novel, first in class anti secretory mechanism of action of Mytesi.
As announced in May 2020, Napo launched a program to educate insurance companies about the benefits of Mytesi and negotiate better access to Mytesi for commercially insured patients. We believe that our enhanced Mytesi market access strategy will engage select payors in contracting discussions with the objective of removing barriers for patients in order to allow them to more easily start on – and stay on – Mytesi. This initiative represents a commercial opportunity to employ a strategic mechanism that is well-established in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry to help patients access Mytesi.
Napo expanded the NapoCares Patient Support Program for Mytesi in April 2020 as part of the Company's enhanced market access strategy. The expansion meaningfully increased co-pay support for commercially insured patients, which includes allowing the co-pay amount to remain the same whether a patient fills a 30-day or a 90-day prescription of Mytesi. The expansion also increased the income ceiling from two times the Federal poverty limit to five times the Federal poverty limit, which will allow more low-income patients to receive Mytesi at no cost. The co-pay program and patient assistance program are components of a comprehensive suite of patient support services Napo rolled out in the second quarter of 2020 with the support of AssistRx, a specialty therapy initiation and patient support company.
As announced in October 2020, Napo has launched a Web-based component of the NapoCares patient support program to automate and streamline the patient prescription process for Mytesi. The iAssist platform is designed to simplify the prescription process for specialty therapies like Mytesi by providing electronic prescribing, prior authorizations, signatures and patient consent; instant access to patient eligibility information; customized 

3




electronic enrollment forms; and access to all platform features at any time from a PC or mobile device. Starting patients on specialty therapies like Mytesi can be a complex and time-consuming process. Implementation of this new, cloud-based system supports the ongoing goal of our NapoCares program to remove barriers for patients to access Mytesi, making it faster and easier for patients to start and stay on the drug by streamlining communications between prescribers, pharmacies, patients, and payers.
iAssist helps patients begin their medication sooner, because the platform facilitates rapid fulfillment of prescriptions and enrollment in patient support services, along with real-time confirmation for commercially and government insured patients of benefits coverage. The system provides visibility through the prescription process that allows patient status tracking and proactive follow-up support by their providers.
The iAssist platform is provided by AssistRx, a company with experience supporting HIV patients, and a significant percentage of Mytesi providers already leverage the iAssist platform as part of their practice workflow.
Jaguar and Napo are planning to develop and commercialize crofelemer for an indication of treatment of diarrhea in acutely infected COVID-19 patients. Subsequent clinical studies may also be conducted in post COVID recovery patients suffering from long-hauler syndrome. An estimated 20%-40% of people with COVID-19 experience diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting before other symptoms (Source: https://www.ucsf.edu/magazine/covid-body). 
The term “long-hauler”, also referred to as long COVID, Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (“PASC”), and chronic COVID syndrome (“CCS”) , refers to COVID-19 survivors who suffer with symptoms which may include gastrointestinal distress (i.e. diarrhea, constipation, nausea, pain), fatigue, brain fog, forgetfulness, cardiovascular effects, and arthritis, for an extended period after recovery. It is theorized that these symptoms may result when the immune system in COVID-19 survivors continues to overreact even though the infection has passed. Long-hauler syndrome appears to be predominant in younger COVID-19 recovery patients and those who experienced a mild/asymptomatic case.
Our focus on the new potential indication of symptomatic relief of COVID-related diarrhea for crofelemer is driven primarily by the evidence of diarrhea in acute and long-hauler COVID-19 recovery patients. Enteropathy, an intestinal inflammatory chronic syndrome typically affecting long-term HIV/AIDS survivors, manifests as chronic diarrhea. We believe this situation is analogous to what we are seeing right now in acute and COVID-19 recovery patients, who report long-term diarrhea or other gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Endpoints being explored for possible clinical trials of crofelemer would include symptomatic relief of diarrhea, as well as potential reduction in inflammatory gut markers, and explore possible gut biome changes, and/or reduction in viral fecal shedding.
Napo has conducted intellectual property filings in support of the development of crofelemer for the potential indication of addressing inflammatory diarrhea, including for example, in acute COVID and/or long-hauler post-COVID recovery situation. As with all potential follow-on indications, Napo prioritizes IP protection. Napo currently holds approximately 144 patents, the majority of which do not expire until 2027 - 2031, and approximately 39 patents pending.
On February 18, 2021, Jaguar signed a memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) with the lead sponsor of a to-be-formed special purpose acquisition company (the “Dragon SPAC”), which is pursuing listing on AIM Italia. Per the MOU, Napo EU, Jaguar’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Italy, will be the named target of the Dragon SPAC and has granted the Dragon SPAC exclusivity to negotiate and finalize the documentation for a contemplated merger transaction. Based on the MOU, Jaguar anticipates providing an exclusive license to Napo EU for the development, manufacture and commercialization of all planned crofelemer indications in Europe (excluding Russia), which rights and obligations shall be assumed by the combined company following a merger of Napo EU with the Dragon SPAC. The cornerstone of the license agreement will be the proposed COVID-related indication; however, the expected license will include all crofelemer pipeline indications of Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Jaguar’s wholly owned U.S.-based subsidiary, with certain obligations to be met by Napo EU to maintain the license, indication by indication.

The Dragon SPAC is in the process of being formed with lead sponsorship by Josh Mailman. A well-known, New York City-based impact investor. Mailman co-founded Social Venture Network (now Social Venture Circle) in 1987, founded the Threshold Foundation in 1981, and founded Business for Social Responsibility in 1992. He is also the managing director of Serious Change L.P., a $100 million privately held impact fund he started in 2006, serves on the boards of Benefithub, Giving Assistant, Baltix Design, and Red Rabbit, and is an advisor to Social Venture Circle and the Threshold Foundation.
It is estimated that as high as one-third of COVID-19-infected patients develop acute and/or chronic or long-hauler syndrome – a constellation of post-viral infection symptoms (Source: Dr. Fauci Warns These COVID Symptoms Can Last for Months, Alex Korab, Newsbreak. https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2104072336660/dr-fauci-warns-these-covid-symptoms-can-last-for-months). According to a November 1, 2020 Wall Street Journal article, the majority of the more than 300 long-COVID patients being seen at New York City's Mount Sinai Health System Center for Post-Covid Care appeared to have developed a dysautonomia-like condition, and about 40% to 50% of these patients also reported symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues, headaches and shortness of breath (Source: Doctors Begin to Crack Covid's Mysterious Long-Term Effects, Sarah Toy, Sumathi Reddy, Daniela Hernandez, Wall Street Journal, November 1, 2020. https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/health-news/doctors-begin-to-crack-covid-s-mysterious-long-term-effects/ar-BB1aAS6V). Based on these figures, the long-hauler population experiencing gastrointestinal distress could potentially range between 20 to 70 million people just in Europe.
Our intention is to focus clinical exploration for the proposed COVID-related indication for crofelemer in Europe, where single-payer healthcare systems are interested in preventative measures to diagnose and treat symptoms early that can potentially reduce the burden of chronic illness later.
The Company has engaged a regulatory agent in Europe and had a meeting with European regulatory authorities in March 2021. As part of Jaguar’s investigation into the feasibility of the conditional marketing authorization pathway, which provides a fast-track clinical review process during public health emergencies, the Company plans to request meetings with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (“Swissmedic”), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) of the United Kingdom. The EMA, in particular, has established regulatory approval schemes for COVID-19-related treatments. The Company has engaged a European regulatory firm that has experience with the conditional approval pathway in Europe.
In October 2020, Napo initiated its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Mytesi for prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients receiving targeted therapy. The Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial is a 24-week (two 12-week stages), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mytesi in providing prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving targeted cancer therapy-containing treatment regimens. Mytesi or placebo treatment will start concurrently with the targeted cancer therapy regimen. The primary endpoint will be assessed at the end of the initial (Stage I) 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled primary treatment phase. After completing the Stage I treatment phase, the subjects will have the option to remain on their assigned treatment arm and reconsent to enter into the Stage II 12-week extension phase. The safety and efficacy of orally administered Mytesi will be evaluated for the prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients receiving targeted cancer therapies with or without standard chemotherapy regimens. The assessment of the frequency of diarrhea will be measured by the number of loose and/or watery stools for the Stage I treatment period.
A significant proportion of patients undergoing cancer therapy experience diarrhea. Novel “targeted cancer therapy” agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (“TKIs”), with or without cycle chemotherapy agents, may activate intestinal chloride ion channel-mediated secretory pathways leading to increased electrolyte and fluid content in the gut lumen, which results in passage of loose/watery stools, i.e. secretory diarrhea.
Many cancer patients on targeted therapy require drug holidays or dose reductions in their therapy due to diarrhea. Reducing frequency of watery stools will provide symptomatic relief of diarrhea and should allow better adherence to the therapeutic dosing of any targeted therapies, potentially leading to better clinical outcomes. We have learned from business development discussions with cancer drug manufacturers that adoption and continued use of 

5




targeted cancer therapies is directly related to the ability of patients to tolerate use of the therapies – highlighting the importance of supportive care drugs like Mytesi to help manage cancer treatment-related diarrhea in this patient population.
As announced in June 2020, a preclinical study evaluating the effects of crofelemer (Mytesi) in providing symptomatic relief of diarrhea associated with the irreversible pan-HER TKI neratinib was presented as an e-poster at the American Association for Cancer Research Virtual Annual Meeting II, which took place June 22 - 24, 2020. The study provides scientific rationale for the use of crofelemer in providing symptomatic relief of watery diarrhea in patients receiving a targeted cancer therapy drug like neratinib with or without cycle chemotherapy in future clinical studies. 
This 28-day preclinical pharmacological study in healthy female dogs was designed to evaluate the scientific rationale for the use of crofelemer in reducing the severity and incidence of diarrhea associated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (neratinib). The study was conducted without the prophylaxis or concomitant use of loperamide and demonstrated that crofelemer caused an approximate 30% reduction in the incidence and severity of diarrhea associated with daily oral administration of neratinib, which was statistically significant, within the 28-day period. Crofelemer also demonstrated significant improvement in the proportion of responder dogs, and there was a trend for fewer neratinib dose reductions in both crofelemer treatment groups when compared to the control group.
In October 2020, the Company held a “Diarrhea Dialogues” virtual event for the financial and business community to address the importance of diarrhea and supportive care for cancer patients as it relates to chronic lower GI tract distress, and the debilitating effects of diarrhea experienced as a result of cancer and/or cancer therapy. Speakers addressed the impact of diarrhea on cancer patients; common side effects of cancer therapies and management of symptoms; data and experience of diarrhea in cancer patients and the importance of the patient and physician dialogue to the management of CTD.
A 28-day preclinical toxicology and safety study in dogs began January 6, 2021 to support development of lechlemer, Napo’s second generation, plant-based anti-secretory drug candidate for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera. Napo is receiving preclinical services from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”) to support lechlemer development. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. Under NIAID's suite of preclinical services, NIAID-funded contractors are conducting the 28-day dog study.
We are grateful for NIAID's support to conduct this important 28-day toxicity and safety study in dogs, which is expected to support the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application we plan to file for lechlemer. As previously announced, a 28-day preclinical toxicology study in rats to support lechlemer development for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera was initiated in July of last year. Under NIAID's suite of preclinical services, NIAID-funded contractors also conducted the initial 7-day dog and rat toxicology studies, and completion of these shorter studies allowed for initiation of the longer-term, 28-day, IND-enabling toxicity studies.
We believe that lechlemer, which has the same mechanism of action as crofelemer and is significantly less costly to produce, may support development efforts to receive a priority review voucher from the FDA for an indication for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. Priority review vouchers are transferable and, in past transactions by other companies, have sold for prices ranging from $67 million to $350 million. Additionally, we believe lechlemer represents a long-term pipeline opportunity as a second-generation anti-secretory agent, on a global basis, for multiple gastrointestinal diseases - especially in resource-constrained countries, in part, because requirements often exist in such regions for drug prices to decrease annually.
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, an estimated 3-5 million cholera cases and more than 100,000 cholera-related deaths occur each year around the world. The infection is often mild or without symptoms but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 10 of infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. The largest 

6




cholera outbreak in recorded history recently occurred in Yemen. According to Oxfam, the number of cholera cases in Yemen in 2019 was the second largest ever recorded in a country in a single year, surpassed only by the numbers in Yemen in 2017. According to the Brookings Institution, cholera continues to spread in Yemen, with 180,000 new cases reported in the first eight months of 2020.
Lechlemer is a drug candidate under the botanical guidance of the FDA. It is a standardized and proprietary Napo botanical extract that is distinct from Mytesi (crofelemer), the company's FDA-approved drug product, and lechlemer is sustainably derived from the same source as Mytesi: the Croton lechleri tree.
The Company has previously presented Phase 2 data on crofelemer for the treatment of devastating dehydration in cholera patients from the renowned International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (icddr,b) in Bangladesh. Napo plans to follow the same study design for lechlemer.
In September 2020, Jaguar launched the Entheogen Therapeutics (“ETI”) initiative to support the discovery and development of novel, natural medicines derived from psychoactive plant compounds for treatment of mood disorders, neuro-degenerative diseases, addiction, and other mental health disorders. The initiative is initially focused on plants with the potential to treat depression and leverages Napo’s proprietary library of approximately 2,300 plants with medicinal properties. According to statistics available from the National Institute of Mental Health Disorders, part of the National Institutes of Health, approximately 9.5% of American adults ages 18 and over will suffer from a depressive illness (major depression, bipolar disorder, or dysthymia) each year. 
Field research collaborations conducted in the past by members of the scientific strategy team (“SST”) of Jaguar’s predecessor company Shaman Pharmaceuticals, who are also members of the ETI SST, yielded possible applications for a compound called alstonine. Alstonine is derived from a plant used by traditional healers in Nigeria, and has demonstrated a potential novel mechanism of action for the treatment of difficult to manage conditions such as schizophrenia.
The ETI SST consists of leading and globally renowned ethnobotanists, physicians, and pharmacologists as well as experts in the fields of natural product chemistry and neuropharmacology. We believe the wealth of expertise, experience, and commitment of the ETI SST – comprised of multiple members of the original SST that contributed to development of Jaguar's proprietary library of approximately 2,300 plants – will play an instrumental role in advancing our shared initial goal of identifying plants in our library that may have the potential to treat mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic sclerosis. Mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases affect hundreds of millions of people around the globe and represent classic unmet medical needs.
While Jaguar and Napo remain steadfastly focused on the commercial success of Mytesi and on the development of potential crofelemer follow-on indications in the area of gastrointestinal health, the Company believes the same competencies and multi-disciplinary scientific strategy that led to the development of crofelemer will support collaborative efforts with potential partners to develop novel first-in-class prescription medicines derived from psychoactive plants.
Canalevia (crofelemer delayed-release tablets) is Jaguar’s oral plant-based drug candidate to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (“CID”) in dogs and exercise-induced diarrhea (“EID”) in dogs. As announced in August 2020, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) has confirmed the completeness of Jaguar's Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness technical section for CID, as well as the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) and Environmental Impact technical sections of the Company's applications for conditional approval of Canalevia for both CID and EID under the Minor Use/Minor Species (“MU/MS”) section of The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2004. We expect that Canalevia could be available under conditional approval to treat both CID and EID in the second half of 2021.
According to current estimates, more than 230,000 dogs in the U.S. receive chemotherapy treatment for various cancers each year, and roughly one in four (more than 50,000 dogs) will experience diarrhea as a side effect of 

7




treatment. There currently is no FDA-approved anti-secretory prescription product to manage this type of debilitating diarrhea in dogs.
Managing this type of debilitating diarrhea in dogs undergoing cancer treatment is not only a comfort issue for dogs, it may also help dogs better tolerate their chemotherapy once CID is under control and improve the home and living environment for dog owners. For these reasons, we believe Canalevia will be an important treatment option for veterinary healthcare teams and dog owners.
Our management team has significant experience in gastrointestinal product development for both humans and animals. Napo was founded 30 years ago to perform drug discovery and development by leveraging the knowledge of traditional healers working in rainforest areas. Ten members of the Jaguar and Napo team have been together for more than 15 years. Dr. Steven King, our chief sustainable supply, ethnobotanical research and intellectual property officer, and Lisa Conte, our founder, president and CEO, have worked together for more than 30 years. Together, these dedicated personnel successfully transformed crofelemer, which is extracted from trees growing in the rainforest, to Mytesi, which is a natural, sustainably harvested, FDA-approved drug available from essentially any pharmacy in the United States.
As announced in February 2020, the American Botanical Council named Napo the recipient of the 2019 Varro E. Tyler Commercial Investment in Phytomedicinal Research Award in recognition of Napo's ongoing commitment to the sustainable development and production of natural therapeutic preparations. Specifically, this award acknowledges the successful development and approval of crofelemer, which is derived from the medicinal Croton lechleri tree in the Amazon rainforest. Previous recipients of this award include Jaguar’s partner, Italy-based Indena S.p.A., one of the world's largest producers of clinically-tested botanical extracts for the food, dietary supplement, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical markets.
Pipeline within a product—crofelemer
According to the World Health Organization, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of diarrheal disease globally every year, and the disease caused an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2012. Although not all types of diarrhea are secretory in nature, we view the current, initial approval of Mytesi as the opening of the door to an important pipeline—underscored by the current approval by the FDA of the CMC for this natural product, as well as acknowledgement by the FDA of the safety of the product for chronic use for the approved indication.
Crofelemer is in development for the symptomatic relief of cancer therapy-related diarrhea. As announced in October 2020, Napo has initiated its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of crofelemer (Mytesi) for prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients receiving targeted therapy. A significant proportion of patients undergoing cancer therapy experience diarrhea. Novel targeted cancer therapy agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with or without cycle chemotherapy agents, may activate intestinal chloride secretory pathways leading to increased chloride secretion into the gut lumen, coupled with significant loss of water that would result in secretory diarrhea.
According to data appearing in “Treatment Guidelines for CID” (chemotherapy induced diarrhea) in the April 2004 issue of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News, diarrhea is the most common adverse event reported in chemotherapy patients. Approved third-party supportive care products for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”) include Sustol, Aloxi, Akynzeo and Sancuso. According to Transparency Market Research, sales of therapeutics for the prevention of CINV approximated $620 million in 2013, and sales of such therapeutics are expected to reach $1 billion in 2020.
Diarrhea has been reported as the most common side effect of the recently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and the pan HER TKI neratinib, with occurrence ranging from 86% to >95% and grade 3 over 40%, in published studies. Diarrhea in this patient population has the potential to cause dehydration, potential infections, and non-adherence to treatment. A novel anti diarrheal like Mytesi may hold promise for treating secretory diarrhea—and therefore also support long term cancer treatment adherence—in this population.

An ongoing investigator-initiated trial (“IIT”), HALT D, utilizing Mytesi is underway. Enrollment is ongoing for this study in breast cancer patients receiving regimens containing Herceptin and Perjeta. Top line results for the study are expected to be available in the second half of 2021. This study, which is not required to support the clinical program for Mytesi for FDA approval for CTD, is sponsored by Georgetown University and funded by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The study’s primary endpoint has an 81% power to detect a 40% difference in the percent and/or number of patients experiencing any grade of diarrhea for two consecutive days at a p value of 0.1. (The statistical power of a study, sometimes referred to as a study’s sensitivity, is a measure of how likely the study is to distinguish an actual effect from one of chance). For the sake of clarity, the estimates of the percent of patients experiencing such diarrhea is postulated to be 60% in the placebo patients and 20% in the study’s crofelemer treated arms. An interim analysis was conducted to ensure that the study has a chance to ultimately achieve the primary endpoint. 
Previously, Georgetown University's Data Safety Monitoring Committee (“DSMC”) reviewed the interim analysis for futility for the study and notified the Principal Investigator that the study is allowed to enroll to completion. At that point in time, enrollment in the study exceeded 85%. The treatment period for each patient is 3 months. 
Napo expects to initiate a Phase 1/2 pediatric study of crofelemer in the second half of 2021 at US and Middle East sites for infants and children with CDD.
CDD is a group of rare, chronic intestinal channel diseases, with onset in early infancy, that are characterized by severe, lifelong diarrhea and a lifelong need for nutritional intake either parenterally or with a feeding tube. CDD is related to specific genetic defects inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The incidence of CDD is prevalent in regions where consanguineous marriage (related by blood) is part of the culture. CDD is directly associated with serious secondary conditions including dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and failure to thrive, prompting the need for immediate therapy to prevent death and limit lifelong disability. 
In December 2019, a clinical research study was initiated and sponsored by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (“UTHealth”) and is being supported by Napo. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of crofelemer for treatment of chronic idiopathic diarrhea in patients. Chronic idiopathic diarrhea is a common complaint of patients presenting to family practitioners and internists, and is one of the most common reasons for referral to gastroenterologists. It is estimated that the prevalence of chronic idiopathic diarrhea in developed countries (including the U.S.) is approximately 3-5%. It has a significant negative effect on health-related quality of life and causes a high economic burden on patients and society. The American Gastroenterological Association Burden of Illness study (2012) showed that the estimated annual direct and indirect costs associated with chronic idiopathic diarrhea is up to $524 million per year and $136 million per year, respectively. The principal investigator for the Study is Dr. Brooks D. Cash, MD, AGAF, FACG, FACP, FASGE, Chief - Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Sterling Professor of Medicine, McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, Co-Director, Ertan Digestive Disease Center at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. The Study is titled Yield of Diagnostic Tests and Management of Crofelemer for Chronic Idiopathic Diarrhea in Non-HIV Patients: A Pilot Study, and is a single-center trial at UTHealth.
Crofelemer is also being evaluated in another investigator-initiated trial for the management of functional diarrhea in non-HIV patients. The principal investigator for this clinical study is Dr. Anthony Lembo, Professor, Gastroenterology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. This clinical study is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult subjects with functional diarrhea. Eligible patients will have functional diarrhea defined by Rome IV criteria as >25% loose watery stools and <25% hard/lumpy stools. The study plans to randomize 80 patients and the subjects will be randomized 1:1 for 4 weeks to either the placebo or crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets (Mytesi) arm, administered twice daily for 4 weeks. Following the four-week placebo-controlled period, all subjects will receive Mytesi for an additional four weeks in an open label extension phase. The safety and tolerability of crofelemer and the clinical response during the placebo-controlled period will be evaluated in this study. Subjects will be allowed to use limited amounts of an antimotility drug (loperamide) during the placebo-controlled and open-label extension phase to manage uncontrolled diarrhea.

However, no more than 11 doses of 2 mg loperamide will be permitted during any given week per subject. Topline results for this study are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Napo has previously received orphan drug designation from the FDA for adult and/or pediatric SBS. The Orphan Drug Act provides for granting special status to a drug or biological product to treat a rare disease or condition upon request of a sponsor. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives, including extended exclusivity, tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and relief of filing fees.
Jaguar’s and Napo’s portfolio development strategy involves meeting with Key Opinion Leaders (“KOLs”) to identify indications that are potentially high-value because they address important medical needs that are significantly or globally unmet, obtain input on protocol practicality and protocol generation, and then strategically sequencing indication development priorities, second-generation product pipeline development, and partnering goals on a global basis, as well as identifying possible opportunities for a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) from the FDA. When granted, SPA provides that, upon request, FDA will evaluate within 45 days certain protocols to assess whether they are adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor. In 2007, under the SPA process, Napo obtained agreement with the FDA for the design of the pivotal study protocol for the currently approved indication of crofelemer (Mytesi) for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. The 2007 SPA agreement was an important milestone for Napo, allowing Napo to address and mitigate regulatory uncertainty prior to the completion of its final Phase 3 trial of crofelemer for its currently approved indication.
Mytesi is the only antidiarrheal drug that has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of chronic, noninfectious diarrhea in adult HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (“ART”). This approval was on the basis of the drug’s safety and efficacy in reducing the number of weekly and daily watery stools in patients and improvement of stool consistency, from unformed to formed stools, over a 24-week treatment period. 
Unlike other available diarrhea treatments, crofelemer does not act by inhibiting intestinal motility. It has minimal oral absorption and does not have any clinically significant food or drug interactions, thereby allowing patients to maintain their appropriate dosing of treatment to suppress their viral load and maintain adequate CD4 levels in PLWHA. Crofelemer is also the only approved antidiarrheal drug that is approved for chronic use. Moreover, it is not an opioid, like other traditionally used treatments; thus avoiding both the acute side effect of constipation and the potential for abuse. Napo plans to ensure an adequate supply of Mytesi tablets to support any requests for administration of Mytesi to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Napo’s HIV Scientific Advisory Board has focused primarily on physician education, and community and global awareness regarding the importance and availability of solutions for neglected comorbidities, such as the first-in-class anti-secretory mechanism of action of Mytesi for its currently approved indication.
According to a 2017 report from Research and Markets, the combined global market for prescription and OTC gastrointestinal agents is expected to reach $21 billion by 2025. Jaguar estimates that a first in class anti secretory agent should be able to achieve a significant portion of the market share.
There are significant barriers to entry for Mytesi (crofelemer). Through Napo, we hold an extensive global patent portfolio. At the present time, we hold approximately 144 issued worldwide patents, with coverage in many cases that extends until 2031. These issued patents cover multiple indications, including HIV-AIDS diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”), IBD, manufacturing, enteric protection from gastric juices, among others. We also have approximately 42 pending patent applications worldwide in the human health areas that are being prosecuted. 
Mytesi is the first oral drug approved by the FDA under botanical guidance, which provides another barrier to entry from potential generic competition. The FDA requires that the manufacturer of crofelemer use a validated proprietary bioassay to release the drug substance and drug product of Mytesi. While most generic products are fashioned to meet chemical release specifications that are in the public domain, the specifics of this assay are not publicly available. There is no pathway by which a generic product can be developed for a drug approved under 

10




botanical guidance. In addition, Mytesi is minimally absorbed systemically, so the classic approach of creating a generic drug by matching pharmacokinetic blood levels is not possible. A generic player would have to conduct costly and risky clinical trials.
While Jaguar’s commercial and development efforts have evolved to focus primarily on Mytesi and human pipeline indications since its merger with Napo, the Company is continuing limited initiatives related to Canalevia, our drug product candidate for treatment of CID in dogs and EID in dogs. CID in dogs is typically caused by the same mechanism of action as in humans, and hence the work in dogs serves as a preclinical proof of concept for the diarrhea in humans that is related to targeted cancer therapy. CID is an interesting model for human medical need and is being pursued as a prescription indication for animal health. We believe there is an important unmet medical need for the treatment of CID in dogs. Certain cancer treatment agents provided to dogs are human drugs or have the same mechanism of action as human cancer drugs, and these agents and mechanisms of action often have meaningful rates of diarrhea in humans as well.
As announced in August 2020, the FDA's CVM has confirmed the completeness of Jaguar's Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness technical section for CID, as well as the CMC and Environmental Impact technical sections of the Company's applications for conditional approval of Canalevia for both CID and EID in dogs under the MU/MS section of The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2004. We expect that Canalevia could be available under conditional approval to treat both CID and EID in the second half of 2021.
The Target Animal Safety Technical Section contains data from a 2017 target animal safety study indicating that the no-observed-adverse-effect level (“NOAEL”) of Canalevia in dogs is approximately six times greater than previously demonstrated and that Canalevia is also safe for use in puppies. The safety of veterinary drugs is most commonly addressed through the conduct of target animal safety studies that provide for the determination of the NOAEL.
The 2017 toxicology study is the first study to demonstrate the safety of Canalevia in puppies as young as 12 weeks of age. Prior crofelemer toxicology studies only involved adult dogs.
As previously announced, Jaguar has received MUMS designation status from the FDA for Canalevia for the indication of CID in dogs. MUMS designation is modeled on the orphan-drug designation for human drug development and offers possible financial incentives to encourage MUMS drug development, such as the availability of grants to help with the cost of developing the MUMS drug. 
For Jaguar’s second proposed indication for Canalevia, EID in dogs, the Company is leveraging the use of many of the same major technical sections that have been submitted in support of the Company's application for Canalevia for the indication of CID in dogs. 
Crofelemer is extracted and purified from the Croton lechleri tree, which we sustainably harvest and manage through programs that we have been developing over the past 30 years. This process has involved working with local and indigenous communities to plant trees, obtaining permits for export, and creating a supply network that is robust and reliable.
We continue to have working relationships with partners that began in the 1990s. Additionally, through the establishment of a nonprofit called the Healing Forest Conservancy, our team has created a long-term mechanism for benefit sharing that recognizes the intellectual contribution of indigenous populations. This program is intended to contribute to the continued strength and effectiveness of the valued and strategically important relationships we have carefully cultivated over the past 30 years.
Product Pipeline
In addition to our Mytesi (crofelemer) product that is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy, we are also developing a pipeline of prescription drug product candidates to address unmet needs in gastrointestinal health through Napo. Mytesi (crofelemer) is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally in the gut and lumen, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders. Clinical trials demonstrated that nearly 80% of Mytesi users experienced an improvement in their diarrhea over a four-week period. At week 20 of the 

11




pivotal trial, over half the patients had no watery stools, or a 100% decrease, and 83% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools. Our Mytesi pipeline currently includes prescription drug product candidates for four follow-on indications, several of which are backed by Phase 2 evidence from completed Phase 2 trials. In addition, a second-generation proprietary anti-secretory agent, lechlemer, is in development for cholera-related diarrhea.

Estimated Size of Mytesi Target Markets
We believe the medical need for Mytesi is significant, compelling, and unmet, and that doctors are looking for a drug product with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the options currently available to resolve diarrhea. A growing percentage of HIV patients have lived with the virus in their gut for 10+ years, often causing gut enteropathy and chronic or chronic-episodic diarrhea. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by 2020 more than 70% of Americans with HIV are expected to be 50 and older (1).

​
The following diagram illustrates the mechanism of action of our human and animal gastrointestinal drug products and drug product candidates, which normalize chloride and water flow and transit time of fluids within the intestinal lumen.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical company with first-in-class, sustainably derived products that address significant unmet gastrointestinal medical needs globally. To accomplish this goal, we plan to:
Expand Mytesi by leveraging our significant gastrointestinal knowledge, experience and intellectual property portfolio
Mytesi is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally on the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple gastrointestinal disorders. Our Mytesi (crofelemer) product is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. Jaguar, through Napo, holds extensive global rights for Mytesi. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including diarrhea related to targeted cancer therapy; orphan-drug indications for infants and children with congenital diarrheal disorders and short bowel syndrome; supportive care for inflammatory bowel disease; irritable bowel syndrome; and for idiopathic/functional diarrhea. In addition, a second-generation proprietary anti-secretory agent is in development for cholera.
Our management team collectively has more than 100 years of experience in the development of gastrointestinal prescription drug and non-prescription products. This experience covers all aspects of product development, including discovery, preclinical and clinical development, GMP manufacturing, and regulatory strategy. Key members of this team successfully developed Mytesi.
Establish and expand commercial capabilities in Mytesi sales and marketing efforts
Napo’s direct sales organization is comprised of Mytesi field sales representatives strategically positioned to cover U.S. geographies with the highest potential. With support provided by concomitant marketing, promotional activities, patient empowerment programs, including an integrated social digital campaign, and medical education initiatives described below, we expect a proportional response in the number of patients treated with Mytesi.

14




Leverage our relationships with key opinion leaders regarding development of follow-on indications
Approximately 19 KOLs who are recognized specialists in HIV patient care, CTD, IBD, IBS, cholera, SBS, and CDD are currently participating in our scientific advisory board or KOL advisory program in some manner.
Establish partnerships to support moving pipeline indications to pivotal clinical trials
Jaguar is actively pursuing the development of a robust pipeline of potential follow-on indications for crofelemer, and the Company’s goal is to establish partnerships to support moving pipeline indications to pivotal clinical trials.
Strategically sequence the development of follow-on indications of Mytesi and seek geographically-focused licensing opportunities
As announced September 24, 2018, Jaguar and Knight Therapeutics Inc. (“Knight”) entered into a Distribution, License and Supply Agreement that grants Knight the exclusive right to commercialize Mytesi and related products in Canada and Israel.
Although it is possible that we may enter into additional corporate partnering relationships related to Mytesi, our intention would be to retain all or co-commercialization and promotional rights in the U.S., so that we do not become primarily a royalty-collecting organization, and we are opposed to entering into any Mytesi partnering relationship that would require splitting indications. We are seeking to put limited geographically-focused partnerships in place in the near term, while also considering possibilities for a worldwide partnership with a leading global entity (excluding the U.S. exclusive commercial rights) in the field of gastrointestinal care and cancer in the long term.
Reduce risks relating to product development
Risk reduction is a key focus of our product development planning. Mytesi is approved for chronic indication, providing us the ability to leverage this corresponding safety data when seeking approval for planned follow-on indications that are also chronic or chronic episodic indications. In an effort to reduce risk further, we have implemented the following approach: first, we meet with key opinion leaders, typically at medical conferences. Next, we confirm unmet medical needs with these key opinion leaders and discuss the practicality of patient enrollment and trial implementation. We then generate protocols to discuss with the FDA, seeking, when possible, special protocol assessments. Our goal is to have de-risked the program as much as we believe we possibly can, by the time we start devoting significant funds to a clinical trial, in particular the regulatory pathway. We believe this approach will lead to better long-term outcomes for our products in development.
We believe that Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value adding benefits—and an expanded pipeline of important human follow-on indications and a second-generation anti secretory agent—upon which to build global partnerships.
In May 2016, the New Drug Application (“NDA”) and commercial rights for human applications of crofelemer (Mytesi) previously licensed to Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Salix”) were transferred to Napo. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in Mytesi is crofelemer, our proprietary gastrointestinal anti-secretory agent sustainably harvested from the rainforest.
Diarrhea is a common adverse event seen with targeted cancer drugs and/or chemotherapy agents typically used in breast and colon cancers, and in particular in the more recently introduced therapeutic classes of EGFR monoclonal antibodies and TKI often used for chronic adjuvant care management of cancer. The increased need for and use of these agents has made diarrhea one of the most disabling issues for cancer patients.

15




We will seek partnerships outside the United States for the above indications while focusing on development and commercial access in the United States directly. We are also focused on investigating (lechlemer) for various gastrointestinal indications. Lechlemer is a proprietary Jaguar pharmaceutical product, a standardized botanical extract distinct from crofelemer, also sustainably derived from the Croton lechleri tree.
We believe lechlemer, which has the same mechanism of action as crofelemer and is significantly less costly to produce, may support efforts to receive a priority review voucher from the U.S. FDA for a cholera indication. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA to drug developers as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. Additionally, we believe lechlemer represents a long-term pipeline opportunity as a second-generation anti-secretory agent, on a global basis, for multiple gastrointestinal diseases—especially in resource-constrained countries where the cost of goods is a factor, in part, because requirements often exist in such regions for drug prices to decrease annually.
The Company has presented Phase 2 data on crofelemer for the treatment of devastating dehydration in cholera patients from the renowned International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (icddr,b) in Bangladesh, and Napo plans to follow the same study design for a trial conducted in association with icddr,b in support of the development of lechlemer for potential cholera-related indication.
As announced, a 28-day preclinical toxicology and safety study in dogs began January 6, 2021 to support development of lechlemer, Napo’s second generation, plant-based anti-secretory drug candidate for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera. Napo is receiving preclinical services from the NIAID to support lechlemer development. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. Under NIAID's suite of preclinical services, NIAID-funded contractors are conducting the 28-day dog study.
As previously announced, a 28-day preclinical toxicology study in rats to support lechlemer development for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera was initiated in July of last year. Under NIAID's suite of preclinical services, NIAID-funded contractors also conducted the initial 7-day dog and rat toxicology studies, and completion of these shorter studies allowed for initiation of the longer-term, 28-day, IND-enabling toxicity studies.
Our portfolio development strategy is based on identifying indications that are potentially high-value because they address important medical needs that are significantly or globally unmet, and then strategically sequencing indication development priorities, second-generation product pipeline development, and partnering goals on a global basis.
Our technology for proprietary gastrointestinal disease products is central to the product pipelines of both human and veterinary indications. Crofelemer is also the API in Canalevia, our lead prescription drug product candidate, intended for the treatment of CID and EID in dogs.
Mytesi Clinical Data
Mytesi has been clinically demonstrated to have:

The efficacy of Mytesi 125-mg delayed-release tablets twice daily was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, 24-week, multicenter study (the ADVENT trial) comprised of a placebo-controlled (1 month) treatment period and a placebo-free (5 month) treatment period. The study enrolled HIV-positive patients on stable ART with a 

16




history of diarrhea for 1 month or more. In the Mytesi 125mg bid group, more than twice as many patients (18% vs. 8% on placebo, p<0.01) achieved the highly rigorous endpoint defined as reduction to ≤2 watery stools per week for 2 out of the 4 weeks in the placebo-controlled period (the average baseline in the ADVENT population was 20 watery stools per week).
In a supplemental analysis of the ADVENT study population, 78% of patients in the Mytesi 125mg BID group experienced a decrease in watery stools at week 4. Among these patients that experienced a decrease, 61% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools. At week 20, 89% of patients in the Mytesi BID group experienced a decrease in watery stools. Among these patients that experienced a decrease, 83% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools, and over half of patients had no watery stools at all (100% decrease).

Diarrhea is a common adverse event seen with chemotherapy agents and/or targeted therapy drugs such as EGFR and TKI’s and EGFR monoclonal antibodies (for breast, lung, and other malignancies). The increased need for and use of these agents has made diarrhea one of the most disabling issues for cancer patients. Crofelemer offers the potential for an appropriate mechanism of action against this likely secretory diarrhea and has prompted interest among physicians concerned about this diarrheal symptom, stimulating the aforementioned investigator-initiated trials. Diarrhea is also a common adverse event seen with chemotherapy agents used in colorectal and gastric cancers, and chronic maintenance chemotherapy. There are currently no anti-diarrhea agents approved generally for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.
Clinical Study
A study titled HALT-D: DiarrHeA Prevention and ProphyLaxis with Crofelemer in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel with or without Carboplatin is currently underway in conjunction with Georgetown University. The primary objective of the study is to characterize the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients receiving investigational therapy in the setting of prophylactic anti-diarrheal management.
As we announced on August 19, 2019, statistically significant top line results have been achieved in a key preclinical pharmacological study to evaluate the effects of crofelemer on diarrhea induced in healthy dogs by a maximally tolerated dose of a specific TKI. The results of the study, which was funded by a third-party cancer agent manufacturer of an FDA-approved TKI, are expected to provide additional scientific rationale and support for the use of crofelemer in providing symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in human patients receiving TKI-and/or-other targeted cancer therapy-containing regimens in future human clinical investigations. The top line results of the study show that combined crofelemer groups demonstrated superior benefit for “responders” (p= 0.01). The results from this key preclinical study show concordance and remarkable similarity to the substantial benefits that were observed in the pivotal human trial of crofelemer (ADVENT trial) that resulted in the approval of the drug for the symptomatic relief 

17




of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patients with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. We are applying our lessons from the ADVENT trial and this preclinical study in our clinical study design that we are discussing with the FDA to allow the conduct of a single pivotal study for CTD in all solid tumor human patients.
As we announced on October 22, 2019, additional findings from the above preclinical study evaluating the effects of crofelemer on diarrhea induced by a specific TKI show that the animals in the crofelemer groups received approximately 20% higher doses of the TKI than the animals in the placebo group through the four weeks of the treatment period. The TKI dose reductions over the four-week period were statistically higher for the control group compared to the crofelemer QID group and trending toward statistical significance in the BID group. In general, the treatment effect of crofelemer was 1.5 to 2.5 times better than placebo for multiple endpoints in this study. Specifically, the preclinical study showed that crofelemer treatment resulted in lesser incidence and severity of diarrhea with the maintenance and tolerability of a higher dose of the selected TKI. The study points to potential benefits Jaguar hopes to see in future human studies of crofelemer's ability to provide symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in patients receiving a targeted cancer therapy in an adjuvant or metastatic setting.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome—Diarrhea Predominant (“IBS-D”)
Diarrhea is a common symptom of IBS, a frustrating, underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. IBS-D is a subtype characterized mainly by loose or watery stools at least 25 percent of the time. According to the U.S. FDA, studies estimate that IBS affects 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States.
Abdominal pain is the key symptom of IBS, and the pain, which is associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency, can be severe. To improve the diagnosis and outcomes for IBS patients and to update clinicians on the latest research, Dr. William Chey, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine and nutrition sciences at the University of Michigan, along with an international team of collaborators, compiled Rome IV, an updated compendium of diagnostic criteria on functional GI disorders such as IBS. Rome IV contains a chapter titled Centrally Mediated Disorders of Gastrointestinal Pain.
Although new agents for IBS-D have come on the market, there is an unmet medical need for long-term, safe management of the abdominal pain associated with IBS-D. We recognize that patients suffering from IBS-D may require a poly-pharmacy approach to lifetime management of their disease. Mytesi, which represents a novel mechanistic approach with the benefit of a long-term safety profile, could possibly be an important addition to the treatment of IBS-D, if approved for this indication.
Mytesi has been demonstrated to be safe for chronic use, and two studies provide statistically significant results of crofelemer use for abdominal pain in women.
The largest group of IBS sufferers are those with the subtype referred to as mixed diarrhea and constipation (“IBS-M”). IBS-M is also referred to as IBS-A, because the condition often involves frequent alternating between IBS-D and constipation predominant (“IBS-C”). IBS-M is distressing for patients as well as difficult to diagnose and manage, and is often associated with pain and urgency as well as significant abdominal distension and bloating. No approved drugs currently exist for IBS-M. Leading gastroenterologists have stated that IBS-C drugs may cause diarrhea in an IBS-M patient, and an IBS-D drug may cause significant constipation. Since Mytesi has not caused constipation in clinical trials or real-world experience, we therefore, believe an opportunity exists for an IBS-M indication for Mytesi. Resultingly, and due to the demonstrated safety of Mytesi for chronic use and its demonstrated benefit for abdominal pain in women, Napo is considering expanding development efforts to evaluate the IBS-M indication.
Clinical Study
Crofelemer has been tested in safety studies and two significant Phase 2 studies for IBS-D as detailed below.

Completed Studies—IBS-D
As we announced on January 8, 2020, a study appearing in the December 2019 issue of Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American College of Gastroenterology, indicates that crofelemer could be a treatment option for abdominal pain associated with IBS-D. This multicenter, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effect of crofelemer on abdominal pain in women with IBS-D. A total of 240 women were enrolled, and participants were randomized to crofelemer (125 mg) or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Following an analysis by the FDA-issued revised recommendations for outcome measures in IBS clinical trials in 2010, the proportion of monthly abdominal pain responders was significantly higher in the crofelemer group during months 1 through 2 (58.3% vs 45.0%, p = 0.030) as well as during the entire 3 months (54.2% vs 42.5%, p = 0.037) when compared with placebo. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of stool consistency monthly responders based on the revised FDA guidelines.
These observed trends of improvement in monthly abdominal pain responders suggest that crofelemer may have a use for treatment in abdominal pain in IBS-D patients without having significant changes to bowel habits. Currently, there are very few treatment options to address the visceral pain associated with IBS-D. Crofelemer has a distinct and novel antisecretory mechanism of action of modulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR and/or calcium-activated chloride channels that may provide a new non-opiate or antibiotic-based option to treat the visceral abdominal pain and discomfort for IBS-D patients.
IBS is a gastrointestinal condition defined by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of another disease that can account for these symptoms. IBS is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition and has a population prevalence of up to 12% in North America and is more prevalent in women than in men. Currently, IBS is a clinical diagnosis based on abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habits. Patients with IBS, but particularly those with IBS-D, report significantly reduced quality of life, higher indirect costs, and greater impairments in daily and work activities.
Phase 2a—a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, dose-ranging (placebo, 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg bid) study over a 12-week treatment period in 246 patients with IBS-D (Rome II criteria), including both males and females, whose average age was 50 years old.
n = 245 subjects
61 placebo
62 125 mg crofelemer BID
59 250 mg crofelemer BID
62 500 mg crofelemer BID
IBS symptoms (pain, urgency, stool frequency and consistency, and adequate relief) were self-reported by the patients via an interactive voice response system. Patients needed to exhibit active disease during the two-week baseline period as defined by a mean daily stool frequency greater than or equal to 2/day, pain score greater than or equal to 1 and stool consistency greater than or equal to 3 (5-point Lickert scale for pain and consistency) to be enrolled. Patients received treatment for 12 weeks followed by a two-week treatment free period.
The protocol-specified primary efficacy measure was daily stool consistency. Statistical analysis of the primary endpoint found no significant differences between placebo and any of the crofelemer dose groups (p ≥ 0.1434), and no significant dose relationship was seen with regard to change from Baseline to Month 3 in stool consistency scores (p = 0.1165) in the ITT population.
A supplementary analysis of Rome Foundation-defined stool consistency and abdominal pain showed positive results. Responders were subjects who had a stool consistency score of ≥ 4 for < 25% of days in a given week and ≥ 30% improvement in abdominal pain scores in a given week (i.e., Rome Foundation-defined stool consistency and abdominal pain responders).

19




When we look at a supplemental analysis at a reduction in a composite abdominal pain/stool consistency endpoint, the regulatory endpoint in accordance with FDA guidance, we see at the 125 mg dose bid a significant 15% difference with just women patients compared to placebo; and a significant 11% when we include both men and women. The current IBS-D products on the market have a 7-8% reduction (Viberzi and Xifaxan).
In this analysis, Rome Foundation-defined stool consistency and abdominal pain responders were significantly more likely during the entire 3 months in the 125 mg BID group when compared with placebo (24.2% versus 13.1%, p = 0.0399) and there was a statistical trend in favor of crofelemer 125 mg BID during Months 1 through 2 (27.4% versus 16.4%, p = 0.0640). Similar positive effects of crofelemer 125 mg BID were observed in female subjects (n = 183). When the supplementary analysis was applied to the female patients, crofelemer at a dose of 125 mg BID was superior to placebo at Month 3 (26.1% vs 10.9%, p=0.0337).

• | Results: The 125mg bid of crofelemer exhibited a consistent response during each month among most efficacy endpoints in women with IBS-D reaching statistical significance (p<0.05) for pain.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Crofelemer had little effect on the stool consistency score, though there was a trend toward reduced stool frequency.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment benefits were not apparent in men, although relatively few men enrolled in the trial (13-16/group).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As with previous trials of crofelemer, no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. Adverse event rates were similar across all dose groups, although, in the two highest doses (250 and 500 mg bid), there was a higher percentage of dropouts. There were no drug-related or dose-related differences in constipation. During the two-week treatment-free follow-up period symptoms approached baseline levels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety: Crofelemer at doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg had a safety profile that was generally similar to placebo among men and women with IBS-D.
Phase 2—a Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of crofelemer for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) in 240 female subjects 18 years or older with active IBS-D according to the Rome II criteria for the diagnosis of IBS-D.
The study consisted of a 2-week screening period and a 12-week blinded treatment period followed by a 4-week treatment-free follow-up period. During the 12-week treatment period, 240 subjects were given 125 mg of crofelemer BID or placebo BID and recorded daily assessments of their IBS symptoms in the interactive voice response system.
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline for the overall percentage of abdominal pain/discomfort free days (“PFDs”). On a daily basis, respondents recorded the intensity of their abdominal pain/discomfort for that day using the 5-point Likert scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=intense, 4=severe. Any day that a score of zero (0) was recorded was considered a PFD.
Stool consistency and abdominal pain endpoints were analyzed using definitions of symptom improvement from a recent FDA guidance on IBS endpoints (March 2010) and recommendations of the Rome Foundation (letter dated 28 June 2010) concerning the IBS endpoints described in this guidance.
Results: The overall increase in pain-free days (protocol-specified primary endpoint) for subjects in the crofelemer group was not statistically significant when compared with subjects in the placebo group (p = 0.5107)

20




A supplementary analysis of abdominal pain showed positive results. Responders were subjects who had ≥ 30% improvement in abdominal pain scores a given week (i.e., FDA-defined abdominal pain responders; this definition of abdominal pain responders was presented in the March 2010 guidance on IBS endpoints).
In this analysis, abdominal pain responders were significantly more likely during Months 1 through 2 (58.3% versus 45.0%, p = 0.0303) and during the entire 3 months (54.2% versus 42.5%, p = 0.0371) in the crofelemer group when compared to placebo.
Safety: The overall safety profile for crofelemer 125 mg BID for 12 weeks was comparable to that observed with placebo and was consistent with the IBS population under study.
Rare Pediatric Disease Indications: CDD and SBS
CDD is a group of rare, chronic intestinal channel diseases, occurring in early infancy, that are characterized by severe, lifelong diarrhea and a lifelong need for nutritional intake either parenterally or with a feeding tube. CDD is related to specific genetic defects inherited as autosomal recessive traits, and the incidence of CDD is much more prevalent in regions where consanguineous marriage is part of the culture. CDD is directly associated with serious secondary conditions, including dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and failure to thrive, prompting the need for immediate therapy to prevent death and limit lifelong disability.
Potential Orphan-Drug: CDD and SBS
Clinical Study—CDD
We have completed safety studies of crofelemer in children as young as 3 months of age, and Napo expects to initiate a Phase 1/2 study in the second half of 2021 at US and Middle East sites for an investigator-initiated trial of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi, for CDD in pediatric patients.
A pre-clinical study in mice, conducted by an independent third-party investigator, is underway to support possible orphan-drug designation for crofelemer for CDD. This animal model study is examining the effects of crofelemer on diarrhea caused by microvillous inclusion disease (“MVID”), a very rare autosomal recessive disorder which belongs to the CDD category.
SBS is a complex condition characterized by malabsorption of fluids and nutrients due to congenital deficiencies or surgical resection of small bowel segments. Consequently, patients suffer from symptoms such as debilitating diarrhea, malnutrition, dehydration and imbalances of fluids and salts. This could be due to either a genetic disorder or premature birth. In countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, SBS occurs with much higher incidence. 
We previously received orphan-drug status for Mytesi (crofelemer) for the proposed SBS pediatric indication and are pursuing orphan-drug status for CDD. The mission of the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development is to advance the evaluation and development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, or medical foods) that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
IBD—Supportive Care:
KOLs identified an unmet need to treat diarrhea in IBD patients, particularly in specific subsets of patients. KOLs felt all IBD patients who undergo ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery suffer severe, chronic diarrhea following the procedure. Because this is a highly-motivated patient population with a low placebo-responder risk, we believe a relatively small proof-of-concept trial is the appropriate next step from a development standpoint.
KOLs felt crofelemer’s novel mechanism of action might also prove to be an effective treatment for diarrhea that results from bile acid malabsorption, which has been shown to occur in approximately 30% of patients with IBD.

21




Additionally, KOLs felt crofelemer’s novel mechanism of action might prove to be an effective treatment for diarrhea experienced by patients receiving IV infusions of Entyvio, a Takeda Pharmaceuticals prescription medicine used in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. Secretory diarrhea occurs when the intestine does not complete absorption of electrolytes and water from luminal contents. This can happen when a nonabsorbable, osmotically active substance is ingested (“osmotic diarrhea”) or when electrolyte absorption is impaired (“secretory diarrhea”).
Secretory diarrhea can result from bacterial toxins, luminal secretagogues (such as bile acids or laxatives), reduced absorptive surface area caused by disease or resection, circulating secretagogues (such as various hormones, drugs, and poisons), and medical problems that compromise regulation of intestinal function. These studies in acute diarrhea support the normalizing aspect of the mechanism of action, regardless of the cause of the diarrhea, and are supportive of the supportive care indication under development in IBD patients.
Clinical Study
Mytesi has safety studies that support chronic use for the currently approved indication and has demonstrated statistically significant results in multiple supportive care settings, though not specifically in IBD patients. The next steps would include a Phase 2 proof of concept study for supportive care in patients with IBD.
Completed Study—Travelers’ Diarrhea (supportive care)
Phase 2—a study of crofelemer in 184 persons in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study for the symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhea among travelers to Jamaica and Mexico.
The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of crofelemer in the treatment of travelers’ diarrhea.
A total of 184 persons from the United States who acquired diarrhea in Jamaica or Mexico were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining the effectiveness of three doses of crofelemer in reducing illness. Subjects were treated with 125 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg crofelemer or a matching placebo four times a day for 2 days. Subjects kept daily diaries of symptoms and were seen each day for 3 days. Of the subjects, 169 (92%) were included in the efficacy analysis.
The most common etiological agent identified was enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, found in 19% of subjects. The mean time interval from taking the first dose of medication until passage of the last unformed stool during 48-hour therapy (“TLUS48”) was 38.7 hours for the placebo group.
TLUS48 was shortened by crofelemer:
30.6 h for the 125-mg dose group (p = 0.005);
30.3 h for the 250-mg group; and
32.6 h for the 500-mg group (p = 0.01).
Treatment failures were seen in 29.3% in the placebo group compared with 7.3% (p = 0.01), 4.3 (p = 0.002), and 9.8 (p = 0.026) in the three treatment groups. Crofelemer was well tolerated at all doses.
The study provided statistically significant results of crofelemer use for shortening the duration of travelers’ diarrhea. This antisecretory approach works directly against the pathophysiology of travelers’ diarrhea and is not likely to potentiate invasive forms of diarrhea or to produce posttreatment constipation.

Cholera/General Watery Diarrhea
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. An estimated 3-5 million cases and over 100,000 deaths occur each year around the world. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 10 (5-10%) of infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. At this time, for example, the largest cholera outbreak in recorded history is occurring in Yemen.
We are investigating lechlemer for the indication of cholera/general watery diarrhea. Lechlemer is a distinct and proprietary Napo pharmaceutical formulation of a standardized botanical extract, also sustainably derived from the Croton lechleri tree. We believe lechlemer represents a long-term pipeline opportunity as a second-generation anti-secretory agent, on a global basis, for multiple gastrointestinal diseases. Additionally, we believe lechlemer, which has the same mechanism of action as crofelemer and is significantly less costly to produce, may support efforts to receive a priority review voucher from the U.S. FDA for a cholera indication. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA to drug developers as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. If approved for this indication, lechlemer could serve as long-term pipeline anti-secretory agent for cholera/general watery diarrhea in geographies where cost of goods is a critical factor, for example, in resource-constrained regions and countries in which a requirement exists for drug prices to decrease annually.
Clinical Study
We have initiated CMC and have multiple animal and human studies in secretory diarrheas. We have also completed a successful trial design for cholera with an anti-secretory mechanism of action, published studies with crofelemer in patients with cholera and other acute severe watery diarrhea disease.
As announced, a 28-day preclinical toxicology and safety study in dogs began January 6, 2021 to support development of lechlemer, Napo’s second generation, plant-based anti-secretory drug candidate for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera. Napo is receiving preclinical services from the NIAID to support lechlemer development. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. Under NIAID's suite of preclinical services, NIAID-funded contractors are conducting the 28-day dog study.
As previously announced, a 28-day preclinical toxicology study in rats to support lechlemer development for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea from cholera was initiated in July of last year. Under NIAID's suite of preclinical services, NIAID-funded contractors also conducted the initial 7-day dog and rat toxicology studies, and completion of these shorter studies allowed for initiation of the longer-term, 28-day, IND-enabling toxicity studies.
Completed Studies—Cholera and Severe Acute Dehydrating Watery Diarrhea
Phase 2 study of crofelemer in the treatment acute, severely dehydrating watery diarrhea with confirmed cholera with the use of an antibiotic (azithromycin) and oral rehydration therapy in 100 adult patients between 18 and 55 in Bangladesh.
A total of 100 adult patients, from Bangladesh, between the ages of 18 and 55, with acute, severely dehydrating watery diarrhea with confirmed cholera were treated with crofelemer on a background of an antibiotic (azithromycin) and oral rehydration therapy. After a four-hour period of rapid rehydration therapy, patients were randomized 1:2:2 to placebo or 125 mg or 250 mg oral dose of crofelemer. Crofelemer or placebo doses were administered about one hour after the oral administration of azithromycin (1 gm dose). The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and effects of crofelemer on reducing the watery stool output normalized to body weight (mL/kg) in the first 24 hours on the background of azithromycin and rehydration therapy. Crofelemer was well tolerated and there were no drug related adverse events in this study. Both doses of crofelemer produced approximately 25-30% reduction in median watery stool volumes in the 0-6 and 0-12 hour period following initiation of therapy. Crofelemer showed a strong trend in the reduction of watery stool output in the 0-6 hour and 0-12 hour intervals (p=0.07). Upon 

23




exclusion of three outlier patients, the crofelemer dose of 125 mg produced a statistically significant reduction in the normalized stool output (p=0.028), and the dose of 250 mg crofelemer showed a strong trend for reduction of watery stool output (p=0.07).
In another study, the effects of crofelemer were evaluated in patients with acute dehydrating watery diarrhea caused by various bacterial pathogens, such as enterotoxic strains of Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae infection. Crofelemer was evaluated in adult Indian patients with acute watery diarrhea of less than 24-hour duration with suspected bacterial infections, without the use of antibiotics. In this study, patients received oral doses of placebo or crofelemer at a dose of 250 mg every 6 hours for 2 days on the background of oral rehydration therapy only. The use of antibiotics was prohibited in this study. A total of 98 patients were randomized into this study (47 in placebo group and 51 in the crofelemer group). Primary endpoints for this study were changes in stool weight, frequency, consistency, duration of diarrhea. Secondary endpoints included the assessment of clinical symptoms scored as a total of 7-item GI index. Clinical success was defined as no diarrhea within 48 hours from the study start date, and treatment failure was defined as no improvement/worsening of symptoms after 24 hours, fever, bloody stools or dehydration.
Results: 98 patients (51 crofelemer, 47 placebo) were enrolled in the study. Sixteen patients (4 in the crofelemer group and 12 in the placebo group) used antibiotics and were considered as treatment failures and were excluded from the “per protocol efficacy analysis.” Groups were similar in age, weight, vital signs, stool frequency, consistency, dehydration and GI index.
The crofelemer group had improvement over baseline and compared to placebo at day 3. More specifically, crofelemer showed superior effects in reducing stool weight (61% vs 11%), stool frequency (65% vs 21%), reversion to soft stool (92% vs 49%) and improved the 7-item GI index (70% C vs 33% P), (all p<0.05).
Crofelemer was well tolerated with no related serious adverse events or concerning changes in lab values. Progression to dehydration and report of fecal incontinence was more common in the placebo group (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Clinical success (cessation of diarrhea within 48 hours of 1st dose) was achieved in 79% of crofelemer patients compared to 28% placebo patients (p<0.05).
Competition
There are several significantly larger pharmaceutical companies competing with us in the gastrointestinal segment. These companies include GW Pharmaceuticals, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Merck & Co., Inc., and Allergan plc, as well as smaller pharmaceutical companies.
Diarrhea in adult patients living with HIV/AIDs. We are not aware of any other FDA-approved drugs for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea in HIV/AIDs patients. HIV/AIDs patients also use loperamide and over the counter anti-diarrheal remedies such as Mylanta or Kaopectate to treat their diarrhea, but these medicines affect motility and can result in rebound diarrhea.
Diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Two drugs were approved in 2015 for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome, Allergan plc’s Virbezi and Xifaxan, which is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Also, Lotronex was approved by the FDA in 2000 but was withdrawn from the market and later reintroduced in 2002 under a Risk Management Program. With the exception of Lotronex, the sponsors of Verbezi and Xifaxan employ extensive media and print promotion for the commercialization of these products. We are seeking a partner to further the clinical development and commercialization of crofelemer for IBS-D. There are currently numerous trials ongoing for IBS-D.
Pediatric diarrhea. Acute diarrhea in children is commonly treated by a change in diet, oral rehydration therapy and/or antibiotics, assuming the cause of the diarrhea is bacterial in nature. Children aged 12 and younger are advised not to use anti-motility drugs (loperamide, for example) unless directed to do so by a physician. There are 

24




recent clinical trials for probiotics and zinc sulfate. Other recent anti-diarrheal studies in children include a safety and tolerability study of Fidaxomicin for C difficile associated diarrhea.
Cancer therapy-related diarrhea. We are not aware of any FDA-approved drugs specifically indicated for cancer therapy-related diarrhea, including chemotherapy-related diarrhea. A recent Phase 2b trial of elsiglutide for the treatment of chemotherapy induced diarrhea in colorectal cancer patients did not meet statistical significance. Opioids and over the counter drugs are commonly used to treat chemotherapy induced diarrhea, but these drugs affect motility. Certain tyrosine-kinase inhibitor chemotherapy agents have diarrhea as a significant side effect. For example, FDA guidance suggests diarrhea prophylaxis prior to initiating adjuvant therapy with neratinib.
Congenital Diarrheal Disorders and Short Bowel Syndrome. We are not aware of any FDA-approved drugs specifically indicated for congenital diarrheal disorders. In the U.S., Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ GATTEX® (teduglutide) is indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support, and Zorbtive® is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adult patients receiving specialized nutritional support. 
Cholera. We are not aware of any FDA-approved drugs specifically indicated as an anti-secretory agent for use to address the devastating dehydration in cholera patients.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome. If we receive regulatory approval for Mytesi for IBS, we expect to compete with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that operate in the gastrointestinal space, such as Sucampo AG, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Inc., Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sebela Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals. Because Mytesi is approved with chronic safety and several of the other agents have safety concerns, there is likely to be an opportunity for a polypharmaceutical approach to long-term management of these patients, removing a direct competitive scenario from Mytesi’s potential entry to the marketplace and disease indication.
To our knowledge, there are currently no FDA-approved anti-secretory products, in particular which act locally in the gut with the chronic safety profile of crofelemer, in development or on the market. Crofelemer represents a new tool in gastrointestinal disease management.
Distribution and Marketing Agreements
Effective January 16, 2019, Napo engaged Cardinal Health as its exclusive third party logistics distribution agent for commercial sales for the Company’s Mytesi product and to perform certain other services which include, without limitation, storage, distribution, returns, customer support, financial support, EDI and system access support (Exclusive Distribution Agreement).
In addition to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Cardinal Health’s purchase of products, and assumption of title therein, is set forth in the Title Model Addendum. The Title Model Addendum states that upon receipt of product at the 3PL Facility (Cardinal Health in La Vergne, Tennessee) from the Company, title and risk of loss for the Mytesi product purchased by Cardinal Health (excluding consigned inventory) shall pass to Cardinal Health, and title and risk of loss for consigned inventory shall remain with Client until purchased by Cardinal Health in accordance with this Addendum. Napo considers Cardinal Health the Company’s exclusive customer for Mytesi products per the Cardinal Health Exclusive Distribution agreement.
Manufacturing
The plant material used to manufacture is crude plant latex (“CPL”) extracted and purified from Croton lechleri, a widespread and naturally regenerating tree in the rainforest that is managed as part of sustainable harvesting programs. The tree is found in several South American countries and has been the focus of long-term sustainable harvesting research and development work. Napo’s collaborating suppliers obtain CPL and arrange for the shipment of CPL to Napo’s third-party contract manufacturer.

25




Napo’s third-party contract manufacturer, India-based Glenmark Life Sciences Ltd. (“Glenmark”), a research-driven, global, integrated pharmaceutical company, is Napo’s primary manufacturer of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi. Glenmark processes CPL into crofelemer utilizing a proprietary manufacturing process. The processing occurs at an FDA-approved Glenmark facility. Additionally, Napo plans to establish a second processing site, which will be operated by Indena S.p.A. (“Indena”), a Milan, Italy-based contract manufacturer dedicated to the identification, development and production of high-quality active principles derived from plants, for use in the pharmaceutical, health food and personal care industries. Indena has completed the required technology transfer and feasibility and preparing for validation activities to support commercial scale manufacturing.
As we announced on August 2, 2019, Indena has successfully developed an improved crofelemer manufacturing process, effectively increasing yield and realizing reduced cost through increased manufacturing efficiencies while retaining the same phytochemical profile without compromising product quality, safety, purity and efficacy. The modified process allows Napo to support the increased crofelemer manufacturing demand expected if crofelemer receives FDA approval for new indications, including approval for the symptomatic relief of CTD. The improved process supports Jaguar’s goal of increasing product yield, lowering the cost of goods, and securing manufacturing capacity to support future growth.
Canalevia will be manufactured using the same drug substance and drug product processes used to manufacture Mytesi.
In May 2014 and June 2014, and as amended in February 2015, we entered into binding memorandums of understanding with Indena S.p.A. to negotiate a definitive commercial supply agreement for the manufacture of crofelemer and the botanical extract, SB-300.
We have contracts in place with all the manufacturers and third-party testing labs required to manufacture Mytesi and lechlemer. We are finalizing a master service agreement with Indena for the manufacture of Crofelemer.We are evaluating alternate drug substance and drug product manufacturers to establish redundancy for DP manufacturing.
Proprietary Library of Medicinal Plants
We possess a proprietary library of more than 2,300 medicinal plants.
Intellectual Property
Trademarks
We plan to market all of our products under a trademark or trademarks we select, and we will own all rights, title and interest, including all goodwill, associated with such trademarks. Mytesi is a registered trademark owned by Napo.
License Agreements
Termination, Asset Transfer and Transition Agreement
On September 19, 2017 (the “Transfer Date”), Napo entered into the Termination, Asset Transfer and Transition Agreement (the “Glenmark Transition Agreement”) with Glenmark. The Glenmark Transition Agreement supersedes the Glenmark Collaboration Agreement and returns to Napo certain rights which Napo licensed to Glenmark pursuant to the Glenmark Collaboration Agreement related to the development and commercialization of crofelemer for certain specified human indications in India and 140 other countries largely in developing regions (the “Transferred Assets”).

26




As a result of the execution of the Glenmark Transition Agreement, the Company, through Napo, now hold extensive global rights for Mytesi, and also hold commercial rights to the existing regulatory approvals for crofelemer in Brazil, Ecuador, Zimbabwe and Botswana.

marketing and distribution of prescription drugs such as those Napo is developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of Napo’s drug product candidates. To comply with the regulatory requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which Napo is seeking to market and subsequently sell its prescription products, Napo is establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of its products and to position those products in order to gain market share.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become approved before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, of the study protocol and informed consent forms for the clinical site before each trial may be initiated. Multiple sites may necessitate the involvement of multiple IRBs and submissions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA which would include the study reports of the clinical trials, chemistry and manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the final dosage form as well as other required sections to be included in the NDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the drug product’s chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects pursuant to a clinical protocol, under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives or endpoints of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA under the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness depending on the endpoints set forth in the protocol.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Special Protocol Assessment
The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate issues related to the adequacy of certain clinical trials, including Phase 3 clinical trials that can form the primary basis for a drug product’s efficacy claim in an NDA. Upon specific request by 

29




a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request.
The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding a SPA must be clearly documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.
Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:

• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; this would include information which supports dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA may also require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA may also require other information as part of the NDA filing, such as an environmental impact statement. The FDA can waive some or delay compliance with some of these requirements.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA 

30




accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMPs requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter must contain a statement of specific items that prevent the FDA from approving the application and will also contain conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use the of product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. New secondary indications must be supported by clinical trials or data. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic 

31




unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMPs compliance.
Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, include, but are not limited to:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, the FDA regulates the purity and or consistency of the approved product. Products, if deemed adulterated, can lead to serious consequences as set forth above as well as civil and criminal penalties.
Foreign Government Regulation
To the extent that any of Napo’s product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, Napo may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
In order to market Napo’s future products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions (e.g., in Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland), a sponsor must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:

• | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

32




optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and

• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan-drug designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws. 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on 

33




the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if anyone purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
Additionally, the intent standard under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. Companies also have been prosecuted for allegedly violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act as a result of impermissible arrangements between companies and healthcare practitioners or as a result of the provision of remuneration by the companies to the healthcare practitioners. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) of 1996 created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any 

34




materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Napo may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which Napo conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule, published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical products for which Napo obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use Napo’s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of Napo’s products. Sales of any products for which Napo receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will, therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover Napo’s product candidates could reduce physician utilization of Napo’s products once approved and have a material adverse effect on Napo’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable Napo to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Napo’s investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and 

35




reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require Napo to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of Napo’s products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider Napo’s products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover Napo’s products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow Napo to sell its products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to the utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs covered under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. Since its enactment, the U.S. federal government has delayed or suspended the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. 
Napo expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that Napo receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent Napo from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Napo’s drugs.
Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare

payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
Napo expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for Napo’s products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Animal Health Business
The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to seek approval, where necessary, to market and subsequently sell our prescription drug and non-drug products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we are establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of our products and to position those products in order to gain market share in each respective market.
Certain U.S. federal regulatory agencies are charged with oversight and regulatory authority of animal health products in the United States. These agencies, depending on the product and its intended use, may include the FDA, the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency. The approval of prescription drugs intended for animal use is regulated by the FDA’s CVM. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration regulates animal therapeutics that are classified as controlled substances. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission may, in the case of non-drug products, regulate the marketing and advertising claims being made.
Marketing Exclusivity
We are currently planning on seeking MUMS designation for some of our prescription drug products, and if we receive such a designation, we will be entitled to a seven-year marketing exclusivity, which means that we will face no competition from another sponsor marketing the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use. If we were to lose such designation or not receive such designation but our application as a new animal drug is found to be a new chemical entity that meets the criteria described by the FDA, we would be entitled to a five-year marketing exclusivity. In order to receive this five-year exclusivity, the FDA would have to find in its approval of our application that our NADA contains an API not previously approved in another application, that the application itself is an original application, not a supplemental application, and that our application included the following studies: one or more investigations to demonstrate substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the drug for which we are seeking approval; animal safety studies and human food safety studies (where applicable). If the NADA is seeking approval of a drug for which we have received conditional approval, we, upon approval would still be entitled to a five-year marketing exclusivity provided we meet the criteria as set forth above. If, however, our NADA is for a drug for which the FDA has determined that the drug contains an API that has previously been approved, regardless of whether the original approval was for use in humans or not, we may only be entitled to a three-year marketing exclusivity provided that the NADA is an original, not supplemental, application and contains both safety and efficacy studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug which is the subject of the application. We have received MUMS designation for Canalevia for the indication of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, or CID, in dogs. Additionally, the FDA has indicated that the use of Canalevia for the treatment of EID in dogs qualifies as a “minor use”, which means that Canalevia is also eligible for conditional approval for the indication of EID in dogs.

Labeling
The FDA plays a significant role in regulating the labeling, advertising and promotion of animal drugs. This is also true of regulatory agencies in the EU and other territories. In addition, advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and approved by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we eventually may sell its product candidates.
Other Regulatory Considerations
We believe regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our animal prescription drug product candidates are not intended for use in production animals, with the exception of horses, which qualify as food animals in Europe and Canada; and our non-prescription products are not regulated by section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which the FDA is authorized to administer.
Our animal prescription drug product candidates currently in development, if approved, may eventually face generic competition in the United States and in the EU after the period of exclusivity has expired. In the United States, a generic animal drug may be approved pursuant to an abbreviated new animal drug application (“ANADA”). With an ANADA, a generic applicant is not subject to the submission of new clinical and safety data but instead must only show that the proposed generic product is a copy of the novel drug product, and bioequivalent to the approved novel product. However, if our product candidates are the first approved by the FDA or the EMA as applicable for use in animals, they will be eligible for a five-year marketing exclusivity in the United States and 10 years in the EU, thereby prohibiting generic entry into the market. If the product has MUMS designation, it has a seven-year marketing exclusivity.
We do not believe that our animal non-prescription products are currently subject to regulation in the United States. The CVM only regulates those animal supplements that fall within the FDA’s definition of an animal drug, food or feed additive. The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act defines food as “articles used for food or drink for man or other animals and articles used as components of any such article.” Animal foods are not subject to pre-market approval and are designed to provide a nutritive purpose to the animals that receive them. Feed additives are defined as those articles that are added to an animal’s feed or water, as illustrated by the guidance documents. Our non-prescription products are not added to food, are not ingredients in food, nor are they added to any animal’s drinking water. Therefore, our non-prescription products do not fall within the definition of a food or feed additive. The FDA seeks to regulate such supplements as food or food additives, depending on the intended use of the product. The intended use is demonstrated by how the article is included in a food or added to the animals’ intake (i.e., through its drinking water). If the intended use of the product does not fall within the proscribed use making the product a food, it cannot be regulated as a food. There is no intent to make our non-prescription products a component of an animal food, either directly or indirectly. A feed additive is a product that is added to a feed for any reason, including the top dressing of an already prepared feed. Some additives, such as certain forage, are deemed to be Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”), and therefore, not subject to a feed Additive Petition approval prior to use. However, the substances deemed GRAS are generally those that are recognized as providing nutrients as a food does. We do not believe that our non-prescription products fit within this framework either. Finally, a new animal drug refers to drugs intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Our non-prescription products are not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease and therefore, do not fit within the definition of an animal drug. Our non-prescription products are intended to support a healthy gut, support fluid retention, and normalize stool formation in animals suffering from scours. Additionally, because a previously marketed human formulation of the botanical extract in our non-prescription products was considered a dietary supplement subject to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (and not regulated as a drug by the FDA), we do not believe that the FDA would regulate the animal formulation used in our non-prescription products in a different manner. We do not believe that our non-prescription products fit the definition of an animal drug, food or food additive and therefore are not regulated by the FDA at this time.

In addition to the foregoing, we may be subject to state, federal and foreign healthcare and/or veterinary medicine laws, including but not limited to anti-kickback laws, as we may from time to time enter consulting and other financial arrangements with veterinarians, who may prescribe or recommend our products. If our financial relationships with veterinarians are found to be in violation of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Other than as set forth below, there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
July 2017 Complaint Relating to the Merger
On July 20, 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, Civil Action No. 3:17-cv-04102, by Tony Plant (the “Plaintiff”) on behalf of shareholders of the Company who held shares on April 12, 2017 and were entitled to vote at the 2017 Special Shareholders Meeting, against the Company and certain individuals who were directors as of the date of the vote (collectively, the “Defendants”), in a matter captioned Tony Plant v. Jaguar Animal Health, Inc., et al. (Jaguar Health, Inc. was formerly known as Jaguar Animal Health, Inc.), making claims arising under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9, promulgated thereunder by the SEC. The claims alleged false and misleading information provided to investors in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus on Form S-4 (File No. 333-217364) declared effective by the Commission on July 6, 2017 related to the solicitation of votes from shareholders to approve the merger and certain transactions related thereto. The Company accepted service of the complaint and summons on behalf of itself and the United States-based director Defendants on November 1, 2017. The Company has not accepted service on behalf of, and Plaintiff has not yet served, the non-U.S.-based director Defendants.
By order dated September 20, 2018, the court dismissed the lawsuit for failure to state a claim. Plaintiff was entitled to amend that complaint within 20 days from the date of dismissal. On October 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint to focus on the Company’s commercial strategy in support of Equilevia and the related disclosure statements in the Form S-4 described above. On November 6, 2018, the Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. The court denied the Defendants’ motion to dismiss on June 28, 2019. The Company answered the second amended complaint on August 2, 2019; the answer denied the material allegations of the second amended complaint. Following the completion of document discovery, the parties engaged in a mediation that resulted in an agreement in principle to settle the litigation on a class-wide basis for $2.6 million, subject to court approval. Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on December 30, 2020. The court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement, and authorized Plaintiff to provide settlement class members with notice of the proposed settlement, in an order dated February 2, 2021. The final settlement approval hearing is currently scheduled for May 27, 2021. Assuming that the court gives final approval to the proposed settlement following the final settlement approval hearing, the entire settlement consideration will be provided by the Company’s director and officer liability insurance carrier.
