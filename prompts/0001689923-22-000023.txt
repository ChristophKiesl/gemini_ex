Overview
We are a leader in Analytic Process Automation, or APA. The Alteryx APA software platform unifies analytics, data science and business process automation in one self-service platform to accelerate digital transformation, deliver high-impact business outcomes, accelerate the democratization of data and rapidly upskill modern workforces. Data workers, regardless of technical acumen, are empowered to be curious and solve problems. With the Alteryx APA software platform, users can automate the full range of analytics, data science and processes, embed intelligent decision-making and actions, and empower their organization to enable top and bottom line impact, efficiency gains, and rapid upskilling. 
Leveraging data for actionable insights is critical to modern business success, but has become increasingly challenging as the volume, velocity, and variety of data continues to expand. Traditional data analysis tools and processes are slow, complex, difficult to use, and resource-intensive, often requiring multiple steps by data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, information technology, or IT, employees, and other data workers to complete even the most basic analysis. As a result, these point tools and processes are unable to keep pace with the sophistication and speed of analytics demanded by organizations today.
Our platform democratizes access to data-driven insights by expanding the capabilities and analytical sophistication available to all analytic producers, ranging from business analysts to expert programmers and trained data scientists. We unify the analytics and analytic process into one simple self-service experience by combining tasks that were previously distributed among multiple tools and parties. Our platform allows a single user or group of users to easily and quickly discover, access, and prepare data from a multitude of sources, perform a variety of analyses, and deliver analytical output to drive data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes. This is done through a no-code, low-code approach, visual workflows, and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can reduce tedious, time-consuming manual tasks to a few mouse-clicks while eliminating the need to write complex software code. The resulting opportunity is significant, as our platform can enable and upskill millions of underserved data workers to do their jobs more effectively.
Our platform has been adopted by organizations across a wide variety of industries and sizes. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 7,900 customers in more than 90 countries, including over 860 of the Global 2000 companies. Our customers include Anheuser Busch, LLC, AutoNation, Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Chevron Corporation, Daikin Industries, Ltd., General Mills, Inc., L’Oreal USA, Inc., Netflix, Inc., Pfizer Inc., salesforce.com, inc., Société Générale S.A., Royal Bank of Canada, Unilever PLC, United Parcel Service, Inc., and Visa Inc.
Our business model involves both a “land and expand” sales motion as well as an enterprise sales motion. Our go-to-market approach often begins with a free trial of Alteryx Designer and is followed by an initial purchase of our offerings. As organizations quickly realize the benefits derived from our platform, use frequently spreads across departments, divisions, and geographies through word-of-mouth, collaboration, and standardization and automation of business processes. Both for an initial purchase and as part of expanding a current customer’s use of our products, we also employ an enterprise-focused sales motion that identifies and involves members of a customer’s senior management team to accelerate acceptance and adoption of our platform within their organization. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is strategic and collaborative in nature and it becomes a fundamental element of their operational, analytical and business processes.
We sell our platform primarily through direct sales and marketing channels utilizing a wide range of online and offline sales and marketing activities. In addition, we have cultivated strong relationships with channel partners to help us extend the reach of our sales and marketing efforts, especially internationally. Our channel partners include technology alliances, solution providers, global strategic integrators, and value-added resellers, or VARs. These channel partners also provide solution-based selling, services, and training internationally.
Growth Strategy
Our focus on empowering business analysts and the organizations they serve to quickly and easily access data-driven insights presents a significant opportunity. Key elements of our strategy for growth include:
•Increase our overall customer base. We are accelerating the secular shift towards self-service analytics. As a result, we have the opportunity to increase our current customer base of over 7,900 customers. We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels. In 2021, our direct sales teams were aligned to certain market and customer opportunities, with an increased focus on Global 2000 companies, in order to reduce the complexity of the organization, redeploy our resources to higher-productivity activities, and maximize our sales opportunities with those companies.
•Expand within our current customer base. We plan on expanding existing customers’ use of our platform by identifying additional use cases, departments, and divisions for our platform and increasing the number of users within our existing customers’ organizations. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is more strategic and collaborative in nature and it becomes a fundamental element of their operational, analytical, and business processes. We have added resources to our internal customer success teams and also plan to continue to add specialized support through our strategic alliance partners globally to augment our current customer experience and training initiatives.
•Continue to penetrate international markets. We have continued to increase our focus on international markets. We believe that the global opportunity for self-service data analytics solutions is significant and should continue to expand as organizations outside the United States seek to adopt self-service platforms as we have experienced with our existing customers.
•Extend our value proposition. We intend to continue to rapidly improve the capabilities of our platform and invest in innovation and our category leadership. For example, in 2021, we introduced limited availability offerings of Alteryx Designer Cloud, our web browser-accessible version of Alteryx Designer for automating analytics, and Alteryx Machine Learning, our automated machine learning solution designed for non-technical users. We plan to continue to invest in research and development, including hiring top technical talent and maintaining an agile organization that focuses on core technology innovation. In particular, we intend to focus on further developing our cloud capabilities, modernizing the Alteryx Designer experience, and developing a robust extensibility framework for our customers and partners.
•Grow our global partner ecosystem. We have invested in and plan to continue investing in distribution channels and our relationships with technology alliances, solution providers, global strategic integrators, and VARs to help us enter and grow in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. For example, we have entered into strategic relationships with PwC U.S., HCL America Solutions Inc., and KPMG LLP, as well as achieved “Elite Partner” status with Snowflake. We also grew our go-to-market relationship with Amazon Web Services, achieving “ISV Partner Path” competencies and, in November 2021, we announced the availability of our products in the AWS Marketplace. We also plan to continue to collaborate with management consulting firms to drive additional business activity and to diversify our partner ecosystem by engaging new solution providers to drive demand generation and partner-initiated opportunities. In addition, we plan to increase our engagement overall with our partners worldwide, growing our partner-attached opportunities and enabling these partners to have more responsibility for sales to smaller customers. Further, we plan to modernize our partner program, empowering our partners with early and progressive program benefits and access to more educational and selling resources.
•Deepen our user community. We benefit from a vibrant and engaged user community and continue to promote initiatives intended to further expand and energize our community. Although the COVID-19 pandemic restricted our ability to hold in-person annual user conferences, we held our global Inspire event virtually in May 2021 with approximately 10,000 attendees. We have utilized and may continue to utilize various forms of digital, virtual, and hybrid events to continue to create market awareness. Additionally, university courses and analytic clubs help evangelize the benefits of our platform and introduce its capabilities to business analysts just starting their careers. In particular, in May 2021, we introduced SparkED, a global comprehensive education program to empower learners of all levels to upskill with data and analytics. We intend to continue expanding our community development efforts and seek to continue enriching the lives of business analysts everywhere. For example, in 2020, we launched Advancing Data and Analytics Potential Together, or ADAPT, which offered free data training to thousands of workers globally who found themselves unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ADAPT, which is now known as Career Changers, is now part of SparkED and focuses on providing these benefits to career changers globally. Any graduate has the opportunity to get certified in the fundamentals of data analytics through Alteryx Core Certification and to advance to the Udacity Nanodegree program in predictive analytics.

Our Technology
Underpinning our platform is a set of technological innovations that make robust data analytics easy through an in-memory engine, sophisticated analytic models, and an open and modular core:
In-Memory Engine
Our in-memory engine is optimized to process data within RAM and can utilize disk, when necessary, as temporary virtual memory. This facilitates significantly faster and more secure processing of data than traditional disk-based mechanisms while ensuring that the source data remains unaltered and is not duplicated. In addition to our high speed in-memory processing capabilities, our platform enables in-database processing to take advantage of computing resources where the data resides for certain use cases involving large datasets. Key features of our engine include:

•Connected. Business analysts can rapidly connect to data in existing formats and locations, reducing the need for time-consuming data transformation processes that typically require IT personnel.
•Non-persisted. Our engine leverages non-persisted data pipelines to enable users to process large amounts of data securely while applying complex logic every time they run an analytic workflow.
•Scaled-out. While most workflows can be run on any single desktop or laptop, when greater processing capability is required, workloads can be pushed to a server or cluster of servers, including Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
Sophisticated Analytic Models
We enable business analysts, data scientists and citizen data scientists to produce analytics ranging from descriptive and diagnostic to highly complex, including predictive, prescriptive, and spatial. Specifically, we enable predictive analytics through utilization of R, an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, and Python, a popular programming language for analytics with many publicly available packages. Our capabilities allow transparency and editing of the R and Python code without requiring prior coding experience. In addition, in-database processing enables analysts to scale predictive analytics and harness the value of large sets of data without moving the data out of a database, improving predictive model development performance over traditional approaches. Deep geospatial tools, such as a drive time engine, create the basis for performing location-based analysis.
Open and Modular Core
Our platform is built with an open and modular core that enables additional functions and programming models to interact with it. For example, our platform can utilize R for advanced analytics while providing a simple drag-and-drop interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying code. For sophisticated business analysts, the underlying code is available for review and adjustment. The integration of our platform with R and Python takes advantage of segmented, but integrated, main-memory resources to ensure seamless, fast operations. More recently, we introduced the Alteryx Platform Software Development Kit, or SDK, in a similar capacity. The SDK provides customers and partners with open access to Python and JavaScript code and APIs that they can use to drive customizations to the Alteryx software platform.

In 2021, we grew our Corporate Social Responsibility team to champion for the buildout of our ongoing commitment to our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, and environmental, social and governance efforts.

We believe that investing in our talent’s growth and development will directly enhance our overall company performance. Employees are encouraged to invest regularly in their own professional development and are provided opportunities to focus on longer term projects. We offer development opportunities through short-term mentoring programs, longer-term leadership development training, frequent live trainings provided by our Learning and Development team on topics such as giving and receiving feedback, change management, leading a hybrid workforce, creating a diverse and inclusive work environment, managing your career, and goal-setting, and on-demand training modules covering a variety of topics that are available at any time through our intranet. In addition, we offer our employees a tuition support program to promote ongoing learning and education at accredited programs and institutions.
Competitive Pay and Benefits 
We strive to provide pay, comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our people. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, including equity compensation, flexible (unlimited) time off for U.S. employees, competitive paid time off for non-U.S. employees, family forming fertility and adoption benefits, and other comprehensive and competitive global benefits. For example, in the United States, we provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all new parents (either through birth or adoption). We have a particular focus on mental health and well-being, reinforced by providing access to a leading mindfulness and meditation application and annual company-wide mental health days. And, for all of our employees, we offer competitive financial benefits and programming focused on aiding our employees with their financial wellness and retirement planning. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with our stockholders, we offer equity compensation to employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs and the opportunity for eligible employees to participate in an employee stock purchase plan.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams work closely together to increase market awareness, drive demand for our platform, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth.
Sales
We sell our platform through our direct sales organization and indirect channel partners both internationally and domestically. Our sales strategy often starts with a “land and expand” sales motion. Prospective customers can download a fully functional free trial of Alteryx Designer from our website and, as a result, become leads for our sales and marketing teams. Generally, our initial deployments with new customers are to individual business analysts focused on a single use case such as data preparation and data blending. These initial deployments frequently expand across departments, divisions, and geographies as additional use cases are identified and deployed, and through word-of-mouth, collaboration, and standardization of business processes. Both for an initial purchase and as part of expanding a current customer’s use of our products, we also employ an enterprise-focused sales motion that identifies and involves members of a customer’s senior management team to accelerate acceptance and adoption of our platform within their organization. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is strategic and collaborative in nature and it becomes a fundamental element of their operational, analytical and business processes.
Our sales organization is comprised of sales teams oriented toward defined market segments. A sales team is comprised of an account executive, sales engineer and supporting resources from our renewals, inside sales, business development, and customer success teams. Our customer success and support organizations are responsible for post-sales training and support, maintaining customer relationships, and renewing existing contracts.
The majority of our domestic sales are through our direct sales organization, with our channel partners having more responsibility for sales to smaller customers. We serve Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and Latin America regions, and select other emerging countries through our direct sales organization and a variety of partners, including VARs and solution providers. We continue to invest in expanding our business with partners of all types globally. This will enable us to expand our geographic reach, extend to new buying centers within our customers, and integrate well with other companies in the data ecosystem.
Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for increasing awareness of and generating demand for our platform, creating high-quality leads for our sales force through a mix of volume demand generation and account-based marketing, and fostering our community of users. A central focus of our marketing efforts is to drive awareness of our platform and increase website traffic. These goals are intended to increase downloads of free trials of our platform and encourage use of our free online training, which are integral parts of our customer acquisition process. We utilize a wide range of online and offline marketing initiatives, including our website, social media, paid search, sponsorships, email, webinars, partner events, and field events often with analytic leaders and data scientists. Our annual user conferences play a key role in providing current and prospective customers with a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers, training, and the highlighting of customer use cases and best practices.
Strategic Partnerships
We have cultivated strong relationships with channel partners to help us extend the reach of our sales and marketing efforts. Our partnerships are primarily with global strategic integrators, solution providers, which include VARs, independent software vendors, and a growing network of OEMs.
Global Strategic Integrators
Our global system integrators include strategic and advisory firms that help drive business activity. For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, HCL America Solutions Inc., and KPMG LLP have specific practice areas that leverage Alteryx software. 
Solution Providers
Our solution providers consist of system integrators, management consulting firms, and VARs. Solution providers bring product expertise and implementation services and best practices to our customers globally. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 500 solution providers and VARs that create scale for our platform through their network of trained consultants, on-point analytic services, and deep domain expertise. They provide vertical expertise and technical advice while solving complex business challenges and generating repeatable analytic workflows and applications in addition to reselling or bundling our software. Our reseller program is designed to scale growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience and care, increase profitability, and increase sales efficiency.
Independent Software Vendors
Independent software vendors consist of cloud and data platforms and solutions and augmented technology offerings that enhance and extend our platform and solutions. We have optimized integrations and solutions for a variety of independent software vendor solutions, data platforms, and software-as-a-service, or SaaS, offerings, including Microsoft Azure Services, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Snowflake Inc., leading robotic process automation, or RPA, solutions, solutions offered by Google, LLC, International Business Machines Corporation, Oracle Corporation, salesforce.com, inc., UiPath, Blue Prism, and SAP SE, and machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We natively support output to most visual formats such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation, Qlik Technologies, Inc., and Tableau Software, LLC, a Salesforce company. 
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets, and supporting existing customer deployments. Our research and development team, which consisted of 506 employees as of December 31, 2021, was located primarily in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts in the United States as well as the Czech Republic, Ukraine, and Australia, comprises dedicated research employees, software engineers, quality assurance engineers, user experience experts, site and site operations engineers, and product managers. We leverage agile development methodologies and work with the latest technologies, resulting in a dynamic, state of the art, automated software development process that has allowed us to deliver high-quality products and services and adapt to market changes and new requirements quickly.
Seasonality
Due to the budgeting cycles of our current and potential customers, historically, we enter into more agreements with new customers and more renewed agreements with existing customers in the fourth quarter of each calendar year than in any other quarter. The impact of seasonality is heightened on subscriptions that are multi-year in nature with more revenue recognized at a point in time when the platform is first made available to the customers, or the beginning of the subscription term, if later, and the remaining portion recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Our rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. Seasonality in our business can also be impacted by introductions of new or enhanced products and services, including the costs associated with such introductions, or wider macroeconomic effects, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Competition
The market for self-service data analytics solutions is new and rapidly evolving. In many cases, our primary competitors are manual, spreadsheet-driven processes and custom-built approaches in which potential customers have made significant investments. In addition, we compete with large software companies, including providers of traditional business intelligence tools that offer one or more capabilities that are competitive with our platform. These capabilities include data preparation and/or advanced analytic modeling tools from Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and SAS Institute Inc. Additionally, data visualization companies which already offer products and services in adjacent markets have recently introduced products and services that may become competitive with our offerings in the future. 
We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom might be our current technology partners. In addition, some business analytics software companies offer data preparation options that are competitive with some of the features within our platform, such as Dataiku Ltd., DataRobot, Inc., salesforce.com, inc., and TIBCO Software Inc.
Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services, or other resources and greater name recognition than us. We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the self-service data analytics software market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and services and technologies are introduced.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of use;
•platform features, quality, functionality, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;
•ability to automate analytical tasks or processes;
•ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•software analytics expertise;
•total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•customer experience, including customer success, professional services, and support.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and quality of our platform.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, security and protection, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities and tax. In addition, we may currently or in the future be subject to various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with our customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, which affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Additional laws and regulations relating to these areas likely will be passed in the future, and these or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted or enforced in new or expanded manners, each of which could result in significant limitations on ways we operate our business. 
New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, products, services, or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional products and services, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements and costs may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. We believe we are currently in material compliance with laws and regulations to which we are subject and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. 
See the section titled “Risk Factors—We are required to comply with governmental export control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
