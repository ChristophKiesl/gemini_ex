ITEM 1. Business.

Sharing Services, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on April 24, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of April 30.

Sharing Services, Inc. is a diversified travel holdings company specializing in ride sharing, mobile applications, Social Travel Alchemy, relationship marketing, group travel programs, brick-and-mortar travel agencies and vacation funding. Our website is https://www.sharingservicesinc.com. Our management team and affiliated companies and consultants are industry veterans, in fact, pioneers in the online travel industry since 1995.

Sharing Services, Inc. - Travel Diversified Holdings Company

We will soon launch PathAways brand, a subscription based travel community offering access to travel deals and offers at generally lower than retail price points. Included in the community are Crowd Vacations, allowing members to participate in group vacations at discounted pricing, with the ability for members to create their own groups. Included is access to a booking engine for paying members with two (2) levels of access that allows members to access over 400,000 hotels worldwide at below published rates (wholesale). The booking engine is based on membership type, and includes cars, cruises, flights, condos and more. In most cases it has pricing not available through the public travel booking engines, such as Expedia and Priceline.

Sharing Services is also launching several other company initiatives and programs that will be a part of the PathAways travel community as well as available through other direct to consumer programs. 

Just announced is the introduction of the Vacation Financing program that will live at VacationFunding.com and will allow members to finance vacations, including airfares, through a no-credit check payment program. This unique program is a first and will allow more people to go on vacation who are currently not able to pay full price upfront of a family vacation.

Other Sharing Services businesses and strategies include the concentration of travel value in niche or specific categories of the travel sector, such as Weddings and Honeymoons, Wellness Travel, Medical Tourism, Business Travel and Host Agency solutions.

At the core of all of the products and services that are offered by Sharing Services is its unique and virtually game changing strategy theyre calling Social Travel Alchemy. Not an actual technology, rather a methodology by which social networks are infused with travel videos with hundreds of millions of views driving consumers to Sharing Services products and services. The unique methodology employed by some pioneers of the online travel industry who are participating exclusively in the Sharing Services mission and outcome.

Mission & Philosophy

Sharing Services mission is two-fold: to allow more people to go on vacation through below retail price points and payment programs and grow the next big public travel company to rival Expedia and Priceline. There is a very large gap in the current online public travel offering. The travel industry is dominated by Priceline and Expedia, who collectively own all travel brands of any relevance. All of these collective brands, which include hotels.com, kayak.com, Trivago, booking.com agoda.com, open table, home away, Orbitz, CheapTickets.com, Hotwire, Travelocity, and more, virtually have the same online public or retail price as the other. At the other end of the spectrum, there are travel clubs that offer below published rates that charge from $800 - $8,000 for access to these offers. The gap exists between the two and the ability to drive traffic or end user consumers to values that live in between. Thats where Sharing Services and its brands and initiatives live.

By utilizing its Social Travel Alchemy strategies in conjunction with its below published deals and offers, Sharing Services products, such as its soon to be released PathAways, can be made accessible to end user consumers, even starting as free members. This allows more consumers who dont know that there is more than the online powerhouse giants, such as the companies owned by Expedia and Priceline, to access greater savings and even with payment options, which in turn will have more consumers going on more vacations.

More vacations purchased through Sharing Services means more travel revenues generated that will be part of the ability to increase market cap., providing a potential significant return on investment for Sharing Services network of investors. We will offer travel related products and services in the $8.1trillion dollar global travel industry offering niche and affinity targeted deals and offers, below retail online price points.

We are developing systems that enable us to provide high visibility of Sharing Services products to consumers. The systems include internet website, mobile apps, and social media of Sharing Services products. We will employ various customer service initiatives, including our own travel agents, strategic agency partners as well as 3rd party travel concierge programs.

Our unique marketing methods include the Social Travel Alchemy and B2B2C affiliate programs, including a network of affiliate marketers working from home.
Taxi Sharing

We plan on developing mobile and desktop software applications so we can provide services to our end user customers enabling them to share the cost of a taxi. Our initial software applications will be a web application (web app) designed to operate within an Internet browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once completed our next applications will be for mobile devices (operating on the Google Android and Apple iOS operating systems) and our initial target market will be end users who are at an airport and intend on going into the main city center serviced by that airport with a primary focus on travelers that arrive at an airport and need to get to their hotel and then return from that same destination hotel back to that same airport. Our top priority is to build a service that will make our end users' lives easier.

Initially, our applications (both web and mobile) will focus on providing a simple and efficient way for our end users to (1) enter their destination, (2) enter their departure time  in 15 minutes, in 30 minutes or now, (3) view the profile of and chat with potential ride share candidates to discuss a meeting place and rules of fare sharing  such as 50/50 equal sharing or 40/60 first out of the taxi sharing, and (4) to confirm and book the taxi share.

Subsequent updates to our applications (both web and mobile) will be focused on adding feature enhancements while always improving the ease of use of our software applications as we believe this is key to end user adoption of our services. Intended feature enhancements include: (A) manually scheduling a taxi share while arranging travel plans; (B) connecting our software applications with third-party travel websites to allow our end users to schedule a taxi share based upon their travel itinerary; and (C) easily scheduling a return-to-airport-of-origin taxi share. We plan on generating revenue through a booking confirmation fee that will be based upon the number of taxi shares and would expire at the end of one year from the date of activation. Our planned taxi share packages and the expected costs would be:


PLANNED PACKAGES | Single Share | | 10-Share Pack | | | 25-Share Pack
PLANNED PRICE | $ | 1.99 | | $ | 14.99 | | $ | 24.99

 
We have not yet developed our mobile software applications, but have completed initial development of our website and web app. More details can be found on the Ride Sharing link of our company website. We have no end users, we have not yet contacted any possible mobile software application developers and we have only implemented an initial part of our business model and we have generated no revenues.

We intend to provide services to our end user customers enabling them to share the cost of a taxi. Our initial target market will be end users who are at an airport and intend on going into the main city center serviced by that airport with a primary focus on travelers that arrive at an airport and need to get to their hotel and then return from that same destination hotel back to that same airport. Our top priority is to build a service that will make our end users' lives easier.

Initially, our software applications (web and mobile) will focus on providing a simple and efficient way for our end users to (1) enter their destination, (2) enter their departure time  in 15 minutes, in 30 minutes or now, (3) view the

profile of and chat with potential ride share candidates to discuss a meeting place and rules of fare sharing  such as 50/50 equal sharing or 40/60 first out of the taxi sharing, and (4) to confirm and book the taxi share.

Subsequent updates to our software applications (web and mobile) will be focused on adding feature enhancements while always improving the ease of use of our software applications (web and mobile) as we believe this is key to end user adoption of our services.

Due to the nature of our business services, we believe that we can offer our services internationally, however we intend to target the following markets initially: the United States; Canada; and Western Europe.

Our taxi sharing services are primarily planned to be marketed to end user consumers from our website. We also intend to advertise our taxi sharing services in inflight magazines, on travel related websites and in the social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) In addition to this we have identified potential key marketing partners that could benefit our marketing efforts. We believe that our taxi sharing services would be beneficial for a great number of end user consumers, ranging from the frequent flyer to the once-a-year vacationer. We consider our service model innovative and we have no knowledge of any other service similar to the one we intend to offer.

The vast majority of taxi software applications currently available on the market offer only the service of finding a taxi, not sharing one. The most popular taxi and ridesharing software applications are: Uber, Lyft , Sidecar , Hailo, EasyTaxi and GrabTaxi .

VacationFunding.com

We are in the final stages of forming a new company with a unique new business model that will provide travelers with vacation financing for air and hotel purchases with no credit checks.

This new division, VacationFunding.com will function similarly to a bank by providing vacation funding for a small fee to travelers who book the entire vacation in advance, including hotel rooms and airline tickets. Travelers must complete all payments prior to departure in order to complete their program and receive their hotel and airline tickets.

According to a recent annual Vacation Deprivation Study, conducted on behalf of Expedia, more than 375 million vacation days went unused in the U.S. alone in 2015. The underlying cause for consumers not going on vacation is lack of resources to pay for their vacations, especially airfare, in advance. When we offer payment programs in our group vacation offers, about 70% of travelers opt to make payments, even with an extra additional fee. We believe that our new vacation funding program will add airfares to the equation and allow far greater numbers of families to travel and take those vacation days they deserve.

We believe we can become the preeminent solution for all vacationers who want or need a vacation but also need help in the form of a payment plan, and, along the way, create a significant financial return for our investors.
