Item 1.  BUSINESS
History and Development of Our Technology

CurAegis Technologies, Inc. (“CurAegis”, “the Company”) was incorporated as a New York business corporation in September 1996 under the name Torvec, Inc. The Company’s name was changed to CurAegis Technologies, Inc. in 2016 in connection with the establishment of its two business divisions. The CURA (Circadian User Risk Assessment) division is engaged in the fatigue management business and the Aegis division is engaged in the power and hydraulic business.
 
The Company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of safety, wellness and power. The Company is focused on the commercialization of a wellness and safety system (the myCadian system) and a uniquely designed hydraulic pump that will be smaller, lighter, less expensive and more efficient than current technology. The Company has not had significant revenue-producing operations.  
 
It is important to note, regarding both the CURA and Aegis products, that the cycle time from the initiation of the sales process to revenue realization can be highly variable especially as a start-up entity. In addition to the activities to be undertaken to implement our plan of operations, we may expand and/or refocus our activities depending upon future circumstances and developments. 
 
CURA Division: the myCadian system
 The Company’s CURA division has developed a proprietary technology designed to (i) measure the decrease in a person’s alertness and (ii) to train individuals on how to improve alertness levels. The myCadian system will enable the user to anticipate and avert undesired or disastrous situations caused by the degradation of alertness. With the information provided from the myCadian software analytics, employees can work with Z-Coach our proprietary sleep training and education solution to correct sleep issues and improve overall wellness.   
 
The myCadian platform is designed to predict and detect a degradation of alertness in a user. The myCadian platform will support multiple wearable technology including IOS and android devices. The myCadian system will include: 
 
● | a risk assessment that identifies the degradation of alertness that may affect a wearer’s ability to perform tasks, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | real-time reporting that distills complex user data into actionable information on mobile devices, 
● | predictive reporting for a user to take action when alertness begins to wane, before fatigue becomes dangerous, 
● | flexible settings to provide employers a customized tool using their defined safety criteria and to create protocols for action,
● | pricing that makes it affordable across a broad-based workforce, and 
● | the Z-Coach wellness program. 

 
The Z-Coach wellness program is a key component of the myCadian system. Z-Coach learning topics include: Risks and Costs of Fatigue, Fundamentals of Sleep, Fatigue Mitigation and Countermeasures. Z-Coach participants gain an awareness of the dangers inherent in the lack of sleep and learn to utilize lifestyle tools to make changes to improve their health, mood, productivity and safety.

Aegis Division: Hydraulic Pump    During 2019, the Company initiated discussions with investment bankers and certain hydraulics companies to evaluate the possible monetization of the AEGIS technologies.  Management believes these technologies have the potential to fundamentally shift the design and manufacture of future products in the hydraulics pump and motor industries.
 
The Aegis hydraulic pump technology has been designed to bring to the marketplace a unique concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be: 
 
● | smaller, lighter and less expensive than conventional pumps and motors, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | more efficient, and 
● | unique in its ability to scale larger, allowing more powerful pumps and motors.

 
The Company has completed a production prototype and is working to align the prototype capability with specific customer applications. The Company has achieved significant milestones in the design and testing of this prototype. Engineering testing and design of the pump and motor functionality is continuing. Our engineering team has progressively made adjustments to traditional valve and piston technologies which have resulted in improvement in the measured efficiency of the pump. We have filed for patent protection for our novel non-rotating pump concept and continue to file patents as a engineering breakthroughs in our design are identified. 
 
Competition, Industry and Market Acceptance
Competition in both the wearable device market and the hydraulic industry is, and is expected to remain, intense. The competition ranges from development stage companies to major domestic and international companies, many of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. As we commercialize our technologies we expect to compete based on performance, uniqueness of design, reliability, and price. There can be no assurance that our technologies and products will not be rendered obsolete by developments in competing technologies that are currently under development or that may be developed in the future or that our competitors could market competing products that obtain market acceptance more rapidly than ours.
 
We believe that the technologies we are developing have significant advantages relative to similar products manufactured in the worldwide wearable device and hydraulic marketplaces. With respect to our hydraulic mechanical technologies, we believe that our development efforts represent a paradigm shift with respect to presently known technology. With respect to our wearable device technology, we believe that our development efforts are focused on a market that is seeking a better solution to predicting an individual’s level of alertness. Although we have not generated significant revenues from the commercialization of our technologies, we continue to focus our efforts toward those areas where we believe we can get to market quickly and successfully.
 
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, there can be no assurance that others will not either develop the same or similar information independently or obtain access to our proprietary information. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would prevail if we asserted our intellectual property rights against third parties, or that third parties will not successfully assert infringement claims against us in the future.
 
The Company has five published patents: two hardware technology patents associated with the CURA business and three hydraulic pump and motor related technologies associated with the Aegis business. We have several patent applications in process in various countries including the United States, Europe and Asia.
 
All key employees are required to enter into agreements providing for confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. These agreements also contain certain non-competition and non-solicitation provisions effective during the employment term and for varying periods thereafter depending on position and location. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce these agreements. All of our employees agree to abide by the terms of a Code of Ethics policy that provides for the confidentiality of certain information received during the course of their employment.
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. The following are our registered trademarks: CurAegis®, myCadian™, CurAegis™, CURA™ and Z-Coach™.
