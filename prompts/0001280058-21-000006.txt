ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of Business

We are the world’s leading cloud software company powering social good. Serving the entire social good community—nonprofits, higher education institutions, K–12 schools, healthcare organizations, faith communities, arts and cultural organizations, foundations, companies and individual change agents—we connect and empower organizations and individuals to increase their impact through cloud software, services, data intelligence and expertise. Blackbaud brings nearly four decades of leadership to this sector: since originally incorporating in New York in 1982 and later reincorporating as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and as a Delaware corporation in 2004, our tailored portfolio of software and services has grown to support the unique needs of vertical markets, with solutions for fundraising and CRM, marketing, advocacy, peer-to-peer fundraising, corporate social responsibility, school management, ticketing, grantmaking, financial management, payment processing and analytics. Our solutions are designed to meet the needs of virtually all types of organizations in the social good community, from major global institutions to small charities to individuals. At the end of 2020, we had over 45,000 customers located in over 100 countries, with millions of users. We are deeply proud to play a part in our customers’ success in their missions to provide healthcare and cure diseases, advance education, preserve and share arts and culture, protect the environment, support those in need and much more.

Market Overview

The social good industry is significant, spanning far beyond philanthropy, and our addressable market is substantial and growing
Worldwide there are millions of social good organizations including nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions and healthcare organizations. Billions of individuals are also active participants in the social good community by donating funds, volunteering their time, advocating for a cause, receiving services from or otherwise engaging with social good organizations.
Our estimated current total addressable market ("TAM") is greater than $10 billion. This includes expansions into new and near adjacencies in 2019, including our Cloud Solution for Faith Communities, our expanded Cloud Solution for Higher Education, as well as our acquisition of YourCause Holdings, LLC ("YourCause") in January 2019.
Traditional methods of fundraising and organizational management are often costly and inefficient
Many social good organizations use manual methods or software applications not specifically designed for fundraising and organizational management for institutions like theirs. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality for the unique needs of our customer base and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some social good organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance.
The nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges
Nonprofit organizations, education institutions, healthcare organizations and houses of worship must efficiently:
•Solicit funds and build relationships with major donors;
•Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors;
•Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents;

2020 Form 10-K

Blackbaud, Inc.

•Advocate for policies and behaviors that advance their cause or institution;
•Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline;
•Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for traditional businesses;
•Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services;
•Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents and beneficiaries; and
•Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases.
Because of these challenges, we believe nonprofits, education institutions, healthcare organizations and houses of worship can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs and workflows to grow revenue, work effectively and accomplish their missions.
Companies, grantmaking institutions and foundations also face unique challenges
Companies, grantmaking institutions and foundations, face their own unique challenges in their social good efforts, including the need to:
•Quantify and improve the impact of their grants;
•Cultivate better relationships with grantees;
•Achieve better internal collaboration and alignment with board members, reviewers and other stakeholders;
•Illustrate the impact of their corporate philanthropy efforts to the communities they serve;
•Engage employees in meaningful volunteering, giving and other activities;
•Ensure that their philanthropic efforts align with their business initiatives; 
•Manage all of a foundation's activities, including fundraising and accounting;
•Expand the reach of their fundraising efforts; and
•Cultivate new and existing donors.

Strategy

Our objective is to maintain and extend our position as the leading provider of cloud software and services for the global social good community, supporting our customers' missions from securing resources, managing their operations, to delivering their programs and measuring their impact. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are described below.

2020 Form 10-K

Blackbaud, Inc.

Execute on our Four-Point Growth Strategy
During 2020, we continued to execute our four-point growth strategy targeted to drive solution and service innovation, quality enhancement, increased operating efficiency and improved financial performance:
1.Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions
This strategy reflects our relentless focus on driving value and outcomes for our customers through our solutions. Blackbaud SKY®, our platform for cloud innovation, is a core tenant of this strategy and continues to power an elevated level of innovation by our engineers. It is also enabling our growing ecosystem of partners who are also passionate about social good, to extend and expand the capabilities available to our customers. During 2020, we continued making critical investments in research and development and increased our engineering hiring during the fourth quarter. We also released the Blackbaud Marketplace during 2020, offering curated third-party apps, enabling organizations of all types and sizes to discover new ways to amplify their impact by enhancing their best-of-breed Blackbaud solutions with specialized capabilities like connecting bidders at fundraising auctions, tracking branded merchandise purchased in an online store or texting volunteers about an upcoming event. 
The customers we serve require vertical specific business solutions to automate their operations. Throughout 2020, we have remained focused on driving value and outcomes for our customers. We reprioritized and expedited product enhancements to support our customers' needs, especially in light of COVID-19 and the continued shift to virtual, digital-first operating models. For example, we released fitness tracking integration in Blackbaud’s peer-to-peer fundraising portfolio, a new virtual prayer wall enabling congregants at houses of worship to share and respond to prayer requests online, text messaging capabilities for scholarship directors and higher education institutions to ensure no funds were going unutilized and expanded the global capabilities of YourCause CSRConnect making it easier for companies to bring employees across geographies together in support of causes around the world. 
Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving continues to gain traction. During 2020, we migrated everydayhero customers over to Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving and sunset the everydayhero product as we continue to rationalize our portfolio while continuing to delight our customers with innovative cloud solutions.
2.Drive Sales Effectiveness
We have been investing in sales and marketing to better address our market opportunity with a focus on digital lead generation. One way we are equipping our salesforce to be more effective is by investing in the necessary technology and resources to efficiently drive an increased number of quality leads and better cover our large addressable market. We have implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation across the company. We are taking a multi-touch attribution approach to measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns to drive efficiency in our go-to-market efforts and improve returns on our marketing dollars. This is just one of many examples of how we are optimizing our structure, tools and processes to better address our large vertical market opportunities. We have also taken lessons learned throughout 2020 and re-evaluated elements of our go-to-market strategy with a digital-first mindset and we have a significant opportunity to leverage the investments into digital to reduce our customer acquisition cost and increase our sales velocity, ultimately, driving a more scalable and cost-effective go-to-market model.
3.Expand TAM
We did not complete any acquisitions during 2020 as we have remained vigilantly focused on supporting our customers and employees during this time. We remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to further expand our addressable market through acquisitions and internal product development. We believe we have significant opportunities in front of us as we are less than 10% penetrated into a total addressable market of over $10 billion.
4.Improve Operating Efficiency
We are also focused on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position us for long-term success. During 2020, we pivoted to place a greater emphasis on profit in alignment with the balanced approach management takes to operating the business. As a result of the pandemic, our near term visibility into revenue growth was impacted and we took certain actions early on to ensure our liquidity (see Note 2 to our consolidated 

2020 Form 10-K

Blackbaud, Inc.

financial statements in this report for a discussion of some of these actions) and shifted more of our focus to profitability. Our employees switched to working fully remote at the onset of the pandemic and the business continued operating smoothly. This caused us to re-evaluate our workforce strategy and when employees return to the office, we will have more employees working remotely either part-time or full-time, even within our hub locations. As a result, we revisited our real estate strategy with a focus on optimizing our footprint for the future of work at Blackbaud, including the purchase of our LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Gold certified global headquarters facility in Charleston, South Carolina ("Global Headquarters Facility") and exit of certain office leases globally, as we will not need as much of an office footprint going forward. Our aim is optimizing our office utilization, improving our geographic sales coverage and enhancing our employees' daily experience to improve productivity and effectiveness.
Delight Our Customers
We intend to make our customers' experience with us effective, efficient and satisfying from their initial interest in our solutions and services through their decision to purchase, engage with customer support and implement and use our solutions. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at improving the consistency and quality of user experience across our offerings. We also continue to evolve the way we package and sell our offerings to provide high quality and value combined with flexibility to meet the unique needs of our existing and prospective customers. For example, we have increased the number of our cloud solutions sold under a subscription pricing model, which can make it easier for customers to purchase our solutions. In addition, we are continuing to integrate value-adding capabilities such as payment services, analytics and business intelligence into our suite of solutions to better address our customers' needs with comprehensive offerings. We will continue to focus on providing the highest level of solution support, enhancing our existing solutions, extending our solutions through open APIs and developing new solutions and services designed to help our customers be more effective and achieve their missions.
Attract and Retain Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base
Our higher purpose is to help good take over the world, and we have incredible customers whose missions make the world a better place. Driven by this purpose, our employees come to work every day knowing that they can make a real difference with our customers as they pursue their missions. Collaboration, innovation and high standards are core to our culture and help to enable the great work we do. We strive to hire and retain the best employees and provide a workplace where their talents and potential are realized. For additional information, see “Human Capital Resources” below.
Drive Strength in Our Sector as an Industry Thought Leader
In our nearly 40 years of operation, we have gained significant insight into the overall market and industry segments in which we operate. We produce a wide range of thought leadership resources, including blogs, monthly indices and white papers, which provide insights and guidance to the social good community. We also participate in and convene a number of industry forums, where we exchange views and engage with industry and government leaders. Our annual user conference, bbcon®, serves in part as a forum to offer thought leadership to our customers, as do other market-specific user conferences, events and customer gatherings. The Blackbaud Institute for Philanthropic Impact (the "Blackbaud Institute") brings together leading experts in philanthropy to develop and share leading-edge research and insight that accelerates the impact of the social good community. The research and reports the Blackbaud Institute produces serve to strengthen the social good community as a whole. sgENGAGE, our blog and podcast, provides free best practices resources that drive impact across the social good community, as well.
Last year, we announced our partnership with One Million by One Million ("1Mby1M") to launch the Social Good Start-up Challenge focused on tech start-ups on a mission to solve problems that matter to the social good community. In 2020, we announced we’ve expanded this initiative into the Blackbaud Social Good Startup Program, a year-long accelerator designed to support innovative startups with the potential to impact the ecosystem of good. In alignment with our commitment to diversity in the tech community, we focused our January 2021 cohort on founders from underrepresented backgrounds. Last year, we also announced The Explorer by Blackbaud Institute, the premier online knowledge base for information and statistics about social good. Content is updated regularly and is provided free of charge to the public as a part of Blackbaud’s give-back philosophy. We intend to expand these activities and further build our reputation as a thought leader within the industry.

Training
We provide a variety of onsite, instructor-led online and on-demand training services to our customers relating to the use of our solutions and application of best practices, including our highly-rated Blackbaud University curriculum, through which customers can achieve certifications on Blackbaud software, which can serve as important catalysts for professional growth in the nonprofit industry. Our instructors have extensive training in the use of our solutions and present course material that is designed to include hands-on lab exercises, as well as course materials with examples and problems to solve.

Customers

At the end of 2020, we had over 45,000 global customers including nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions, healthcare organizations and other social good entities. There are millions of users of our solutions in more than 100 countries. Our largest single customer accounted for less than 1% of our 2020 consolidated revenue.

Sales and Marketing

Most of our solutions and related services are sold through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force is complemented by a team of business development representatives responsible for sales lead generation and qualification. These sales and marketing professionals are primarily located throughout the United States, the U.K., Canada and Australia. As of December 31, 2020, we had 367 direct sales employees.
We conduct marketing programs to create brand recognition and market awareness for our solutions and services. Our marketing efforts include participation at trade shows, technical conferences and technology seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals, preparation of competitive analyses and the use of software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in our advertising and promotional activities.
We believe relationships with third parties can enhance our sales and marketing efforts. We have and will continue to establish additional relationships with companies that provide services to the philanthropic industry, such as consultants, educators, publishers, financial service providers, complementary technology providers and data providers. These companies promote or complement our solutions and provide us access to new customers.

Competition

The market for software and related services in the philanthropic industry is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low, as general tools for small businesses can usually be configured to manage the most basic marketing, contact management, and accounting needs of social good organizations. In parallel, as software development evolves from a highly-complex tradecraft with nuanced understanding of architectural patterns and discrete languages, to click-to-code and drag-and-drop development with natively cloud-based infrastructure, it becomes easier for competitors to quickly spin up basic applications with embedded security and functionality. However, once basic needs are met, programs unique to social good organizations like fundraising, gift and grant management, and peer-to-peer activism require highly specialized tools to configure and transform general business software to match the complexities of the industry. These specialized applications have a higher barrier of entry as they require industry insight to accurately articulate the business workflow that generates the requirements for software products. Moreover, because social good organizations rely heavily on relationships with and among their supporters, integration of systems drives value beyond mere efficiency. Hence, we believe our insight, the full spectrum of our current solutions and our ability to deliver on future solutions makes us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new entrants as focus on social investment solutions increases to satisfy Millennial and Gen Z donors, the barriers of entry continue to decline with natively cloud solutions and social good organizations more readily require digital transformation of business processes and data-driven decision making.

Blackbaud, Inc.

Our competition falls into four primary categories:
•Niche products are usually developed as a solution for a single problem at an organization and are adopted by similar organizations to solve a specialized need. These are typically offered by vendors who may have deep industry expertise but may not have the resources to expand beyond a specialized area. We believe we compete against these solutions by offering a set of integrated solutions rather than a single point solution, which we believe improves the overall customer experience. In addition, our open platform allows integration to specialized applications so the opportunity for disruption from these competitors is minimized.
•Vertical-specific solutions are offered by competitors seeking to meet the enterprise-wide needs of a specific sub-segment of social good community. Typically, these solutions are offered by vendors who may offer either a point solution or integrated suite of products used by a vertical. We believe we compete successfully against these competitors through a combination of our integrated suite of offerings within verticals where we compete, offering solutions with market leading robustness as well as the scale, reach, and reputation of our organization.
•General business software vendors, such as Salesforce.com and Oracle, compete with us in certain areas of our business. While there is a growing trend toward social investment that is prompting philanthropic solutions from these general business vendors, most do not have a complete nonprofit specific focus and, therefore, do not offer or intend to offer nonprofit-specific versions for outside sales. However, there is a subset of general business software competitors who have introduced nonprofit-specific versions of their products. These products generally do not satisfy the needs of nonprofits from end-to-end as they were not designed to support the specific needs of nonprofits during the original architecture, design, and requirements elicitation phases; therefore, we believe that because these products were not originally designed for nonprofits, they are not yet fully capable of meeting market needs without significant customization. The significant customization required to transform general business products into nonprofit solutions often requires the use of consultants to guide the implementation, without which, leave the adoption of general business software limited to very basic operations and simple needs. We believe our solutions compete successfully against general business software as a nonprofit’s needs grow more complex. As a result, we believe we can compete successfully to meet nonprofit-specific requirements, often integrating with general business platforms used for their more generalized operations.
•Consumer-oriented fundraising platforms, such as GoFundMe, Virgin Money Giving and Facebook compete with our business where consumers raise funds directly. To drive adoption of their platforms, these vendors rely on a combination of direct-to-consumer marketing, marketing to nonprofits who in turn market to their supporters, and marketing to intermediate entities such as an event sponsor who will market to participants. We believe we compete well in this market through a combination of positive brand recognition among all three of these groups and the combination of our consumer- and organization-oriented tools relative to those of the competition.
Less frequently, we compete with providers of traditional, non-automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer to peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organization and more efficient.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality procedures. We maintain many trademarks, including, but not limited to “Blackbaud,” “Raiser's Edge NXT” and “Luminate.” We currently have one active patent on our technology and have two pending patent applications.

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2020, we had over 3,100 employees, none of whom are represented by unions or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We are not involved in any material disputes with any of our employees, and we believe that relations with our employees are strong.
We benefit from an engaged and driven employee base motivated to join the company by our higher purpose, which is "to help good take over the world." Our purpose attracts talented, competitive applicants, with 92% of employees saying our focus on social good organizations was a driver in their decision to join the company. This differentiator not only builds stronger employee engagement, but it helps us to provide a higher level of service to our customers across the social good community, with 92% of employees reporting that they actively serve as volunteers and 23% serving on a nonprofit board or committee — direct experience that enables them to better serve our customer base.
Blackbaud also attracts talented employees through effective and targeted recruiting strategies. In 2020, Blackbaud announced the launch of a new workforce strategy, allowing for many employees to have the option to work from other geographic locations within the country of the position, helping to expand the pool of qualified applicants for roles.
Employee engagement is a focus at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better to attract, develop, and retain talent. Every manager at Blackbaud is required to take a multi-course "Engagement Labs" training designed to equip them with the practical skills to ensure their teams are highly engaged. We assess and measure progress on engagement and growth opportunities at the individual level through quarterly check-ins and a global career framework that guides employee progression on both management and individual contributor career paths; we also assess engagement on the team and company level through regular employee surveying. We enable employees to have opportunities for career development through on-demand and company-led trainings. Our compensation framework is designed so that employees are compensated equitably and competitively, including through base salary, variable pay, equity awards and benefits. We also seek to support the whole person, through benefits that support wellness and financial health.
Ultimately, we believe that Blackbaud is an excellent place to work due to our active participation in the Ecosystem of Good®: we govern our business ethically, contribute to causes and communities that matter to our employees through corporate philanthropy, we pursue sustainability, and we work every day to ensure our workplace is supportive, inclusive and engaging. We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees as agents of good, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor noteworthy examples of volunteerism, employee-led

grant committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused community programs.
Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion supports our efforts to attract, develop and retain a high-performing employee base. In September 2020, we welcomed our first Diversity and Inclusion Officer, as part of our strategy to further accelerate our diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts, while continuing to strengthen relationships with our people and the communities in which we operate. This new leadership focus will amplify and accelerate the significant initiatives already in place at Blackbaud, including: ongoing unconscious bias workshops; respect in the workplace training for all employees and enhanced training for managers; business networking affinity groups, including veterans, LGBTQ employees, women in technology, women in sales, African American employees and employees interested in sustainability.
