 ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS
 
 GrowLife, Inc. (“GrowLife” or the “Company”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation.
 
 Our goal of becoming the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines continues to guide our decisions. Our mission is to best serve more cultivators in the design, build-out, expansion and maintenance of their facilities with products of high quality, exceptional value and competitive price. Through knowledgeable representatives, regional centers and its e-commerce website, GrowLife provides essential and hard-to-find goods including growing media, industry-leading hydroponics equipment, organic plant nutrients, and thousands more products to specialty grow operations across the United States.
 
 We primarily sell through our wholly owned subsidiary, GrowLife Hydroponics, Inc. GrowLife companies distribute and sell over 15,000 products through its e-commerce distribution channel, GrowLifeEco.com, and through our regional retail storefronts. GrowLife and its business units are organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws.
 
 We are focusing on future success. In that regard, we believe that the hydroponics supply industry will experience significant growth and, as a result, operating in this industry has become highly competitive, cash intensive and customer centric.  However, we have plans to address these challenges. 
 
 First, the opportunity to sell both infrastructure equipment and recurring supplies to the indoor cultivation industry is constantly increasing as demand for indoor cultivation grows across the United States. GrowLife believes the demand will continue to grow and more and more states and municipalities, including California enact rules and regulations allowing for more indoor cultivation activities. GrowLife continues with its multi-faceted distribution strategy, which we believe serves customers in the following manner: Direct sales to large commercial customers, retail in some markets for local convenience, and e-commerce via GrowLifeEco.com to fulfill orders across the nation from customers of all sizes. 
 
 Second, serving what GrowLife sees as an increasing number of cultivators has become cash intensive because of the need for large inventory levels at retail, extensive e-commerce online marketing, and supporting payment terms to large accounts.  Currently, GrowLifeEco.com offers over 15,000 products, far beyond the 3,000 found in Greners.com, its former online store. This on-line website was expanded by the fall of 2016.
 
 Third, GrowLife’s customers come in different stages from caregiver cultivators to 80,000+ square foot commercial operations.  With the use of e-commerce, GrowLife endeavors to reach as many customers as possible in areas where we do not have stores or a direct sales presence.  Last year GrowLife built GrowLifeEco.com, our new e-commerce website, that is optimized for mobile devices.  GrowLife put web marketing in place to increase awareness, traffic and conversions.
 
 GrowLife started the expansion of sales and store personnel and marketing efforts with the new funding vehicle with Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. Chicago Venture is supportive in the expansion of the sales and marketing teams in a growing market. GrowLife is expecting growth in several markets, including California. GrowLife receives funding twice a month for such costs. As the personnel were hired late in the December 2016 quarter, the impact is expected to start in the March 2017 quarter.
 
 GrowLife also considered the lack of capital access since 2014 and the new funding vehicles with Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. Operations were significantly impacted during 2014- 2016 as a result of the lack of access to capital. GrowLife did not have cash to ship orders. With the addition of GrowLife’s new partners, we have access to capital and are growing our sales again.
 
 Also, we recognize demand is increasing from small, aspiring cultivation consumers across the country seeking to learn and use a complete indoor growing solution.  To address this demand, we packaged GrowLife Cube, an entry-level offering for consumers to get hands-on experience with indoor growing.  Although many still buy the components separately, we are working on developing videos and supplier tools to attract them to this one-stop shop program.  Given the election results in California GrowLife Cube is expected to provide greater value and specialty services.

  Resumed Trading of our Common Stock
 
  On February 18, 2016, our common stock resumed unsolicited quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving clearance from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on our Form 15c2-11. We are currently taking the appropriate steps to uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with market makers as soon as it is able.
 Market Size and Growth
 
 While there is a great deal of purchasing of indoor cultivation equipment for non-Cannabis cultivation, many of our investors have a high-interest in the direction of the Cannabis industry as it may directly affect GrowLife’s growth. Therefore, the following market information is provided.
 
  Twenty eight states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. Three other states will soon join them after recently passing measures permitting use of medical marijuana.
 
  Seven states and the District of Columbia have adopted more expansive laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Most recently, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada all passed measures in November legalizing recreational marijuana. California’s Prop. 64 measure allows adults 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants in their homes. Other tax and licensing provisions of the law will not take effect until January 2018.
 
  Several legislatures in states recently passing legalization measures are debating regulatory proposals around the use and sale of marijuana. Massachusetts lawmakers are weighing bills that would lower the amount that residents can legally possess or place restrictions on retails stores. In Nevada, one proposal calls for businesses to obtain permits allowing for the public use of marijuana.
 
  A number of states have also decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Other states have passed medical marijuana laws allowing for limited use of cannabis. Some medical marijuana laws are broader than others, with types of medical conditions that allow for treatment varying from state to state. Others states (not shown on the map below) have passed laws allowing residents to possess cannabis oil if they suffer from certain medical illnesses.
 
  Our map shows current state laws and recently-approved ballot measures legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. Medical marijuana laws recently passing in Arkansas, Florida and North Dakota have yet to become effective.
 
  Information is current as of January 30, 2017.

 GrowLife serves a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without having to compromise quality - regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions.
 
 Indoor growing is commonly used for plant-based medicines because they often require high-degree of regulation and controls including government compliance, security, and crop consistency. This makes indoor growing a preferred method. Cultivators of plant-based medicines often make a significant investment to design and build-out their facilities. They look to work with companies such as GrowLife who understand their specific needs, and can help mitigate risks that could jeopardize their crops.
 
 Indoor growing techniques, however, are not limited to plant-based medicines. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables are beginning to emerge in the market due to a rising shortage of farmland, and environmental vulnerabilities including drought, other severe weather conditions and insect pests. Indoor growing techniques enables cultivators to grow crops all-year-round in urban areas, and take up less ground while minimizing environmental risks. Indoor growing techniques typically require a more significant upfront investment to design and build-out these facilities, than traditional farmlands. If new innovations lower the costs for indoor growing, and the costs to operate traditional farmlands continue to rise, then indoor growing techniques may be a compelling alternative for the broader agricultural industry.

  Strategy
 
 Our long-term strategy revolves around three premises: First, the indoor growing market for fruits, vegetables and medical plants is here to stay. We see an opportunity for it to double for several years, especially after last year’s election raising the number of states that support Cannabis; Second, GrowLife will continue to establish itself as a national brand to provide the much-needed advisory services and sell lighting, nutrients, mediums and other equipment, supplies and services to cultivators across the country; And third, the demand for more healthy, safer and economical ways to run indoor growing operations will dramatically increase and require innovative products to intelligently drive down costs without compromising quality. These are critical premises for the Company’s growth.
 
 Our growth plan consists of adding more knowledgeable, talented and committed people, creating greater access to equipment and supplies, and offering more and better choices. We must sequence our steps in a timely and deliberate manner.
 
 Our Base business provides GrowLife with a solid high-growth foundation, especially as we see interest increase for the GrowLife Retail License Program that was announced at the end of 2016. This License Program creates financial and operating efficiencies for GrowLife. We are shifting our retail store business from a fixed to variable cost structure, which allows us to apply our indoor cultivation competency to other retail partners, and reach more cultivators in markets across the US faster. The License Program offerings range from a Store-within-the-store, such as the one in place in Philadelphia at Fairmount Hardware, an Ace Hardware franchisee, located at 2011 Fairmount Ave, Philadelphia, PA, to partnering with retail investors who seek to set up new GrowLife-licensed hydroponic stores. We are pleased with the initial response and lessons learned from the License Program, which have helped refine our offerings, customer engagement and operating process.
 
 The other two channels for our Base business, Online e-commerce and Direct Sales, continue to be refined as we apply more talent to them. We plan to serve the Base business with these channels by helping those price-sensitive customers drive down their equipment and supply costs. While this puts great price pressure on our manufacturers, we closely watch metrics move to the lowest cost per gram. One of the largest cultivators recently shifted their lights from a popular 1,000W to 315W where the electricity savings alone drove down their production cost by 35% and production increased by 20%.
 
 In addition, our Expansion business efforts are equally capable of revenue growth. However, Expansion investments come with great risk not too different than building a start-up. Our Expansion efforts are intended to be game-changers.
 
 The Cannabis industry itself is a game-changer. Many people are discovering great benefits with the plant that are far beyond its commercial growth. Even with all the government challenges we believe that both business and consumer will persevere because the demand and benefit of the plant are genuine based on scientific research conducted throughout the world. Consistent safety measures and standards are on their way. Therefore, we see the greatest opportunities and challenges to be in helping to address the mainstream acceptance and management of the plant…the game-changers.
 
 GrowLife will therefore be pursuing such game-changers to help propel the industry forward on several fronts. Acquisitions may range from innovations that significantly drive down the operating costs for commercial cultivators to the desperately needed cloud-based tools for the government to extensively coordinate its policies with the industry in a safe and responsible manner. We expect to see some of these Expansion game-changers come to market in 2017. The caveat is that there are many moving parts and these game-changers may or may not come to pass.
 
 GrowLife’s greatest growth may come from a business that is not a significant contributor today. We see three key areas that may be game-changers for us in 2017: Mergers & Acquisitions and Partnerships (MAP); Consumer with GrowLife Cube; and plant-related services. Each of these areas will require us to add the right people at the right time. Many talented individuals are ready to join GrowLife.
 
 MAP in our Base business with Retail Licensing Program has quickly taught us to invest in new procedures and people. Growth from M&A is the most obvious expansion move. Over the last year we explored a half-a-dozen acquisition opportunities. However, we found that they were all over-priced. Even after factoring in the possible valuation lift to the PHOT share price, the risk/reward did not make sense.
 
 The most visible example was Go Green Hydroponics, where we had entered into a non-binding letter of intent last year. We recently announced in an SEC 8-K/A filing that the non-binding letter of intent had expired and GrowLife does not expect to close the acquisition of Go Green Hydroponics. We will therefore not be pursuing this acquisition since our retail strategy has shifted to the GrowLife Retail Licensing Program.
 
 Another area we are continuing to develop is demand from new consumers entering the industry, where they seek to learn how to build indoor operations. We have tested GrowLife Cube, an entry-level growing package that provides the basic set-up for an indoor farming operation. GrowLife provides all the necessary growing equipment and supplies. We have determined that there are many consumers without growing experience, knowledge and local access to hydroponic equipment and supplies. Therefore, we are tuning GrowLife Cube to more effectively reach and satisfy these new consumers.

 Finally, in January we spent a few days at the Seed to Sale Show in Denver to explore the plant and seed business. Our conclusion is that it is an attractive business that needs to be further explored but in an indirect manner. GrowLife is not ready to directly touch the plant due to Federal interstate laws. We are instead considering how to legally support it through state based-partners.
 
 We see the indoor cultivation industry as growing faster than other industries due to increasing demand for and legalization of non-toxic pain relief medicines. For years GrowLife has built its brand through experience with leading commercial cultivators. We continue to assemble the best team in the industry to create a great opportunity. Our investors and shareholders have shown strong loyalty and support even through difficult times.
 
 Overall, GrowLife is in a stronger position than it has been for some time. With continued work and support, we are encouraged with the prospect of bringing growth back to the company and increase shareholder value.
 
  Key Market Priorities
 
 Our goal of becoming the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines requires GrowLife to (i) expand our nationwide, multi-channel sales network presence, (ii) offer the best terms for the full range of build-out equipment and consumable supplies, and (iii) deliver superior, innovative products.
 
 First, we provide distribution through retail, e-commerce and direct sales to have national coverage and serve cultivators of all sizes. Each channel offers varying pricing for differing benefits. Retail sells at list price by offering inventory convenience, e-commerce provides lower prices without requiring local inventory, and direct sales delivers the best bid price for high-volume purchasers. Additional points of service may be added through existing distribution locations and services. This may be done in several manners and programs that may incorporate cultivator-centric locations with other retailer store owners.
 
 Second, we serve the needs of all size cultivators and each one’s unique formulation, or ‘recipe’. We provide thousands of varieties of supplies from dozens of vendors and distributors. More importantly is our experience of knowing which products to recommend under each customer’s circumstance.
 
 And third, our experience with hundreds of customers allows us to determine specific product needs and sources to test new designs. Lights, pesticides, nutrients, extraction and growing systems are some examples of products that GrowLife can provide. Popular name branded products are seeking to be part of the GrowLife company in many forms. In exchange, we can market their products in a unique manner over generic products.
 
 Our company can expand with these strategies until it serves more indoor cultivators throughout the country. Once a customer is engaged, we can gradually expand their purchasing market share by providing greater economic benefit to the customers who buy more products from GrowLife than from other suppliers.
 
  Employees
 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had one full-time employee and one consultant at our Seattle, Washington office. Marco Hegyi, our Chief Executive Officer, is based in Kirkland, Washington. Mark E. Scott, our consulting CFO, is based primarily in Seattle, Washington. In addition, we have 10 employees located throughout the United States who operate our e-commerce, direct sales and retail businesses. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
 Key Partners
 
 Our key customers vary by state and are expected to be more defined as the company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing contracts. 
 
 Our key suppliers include distributors such as HydroFarm, Urban Horticultural Supply and Sunlight Supply to product-specific suppliers. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to indoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines.
 
  Competition
 
 Certain large commercial cultivators have found themselves willing to assume their own equipment support by buying large volume purchased directly from certain suppliers and distributors such as Sunlight Supplies and HydroFarm. Other key competitors on the retail side consist of local and regional hydroponic resellers of indoor growing equipment. On the e-commerce business, GrowersHouse.com, Hydrobuilder.com, HorticultureSource.com and smaller online resellers using Amazon and eBay e-commerce market systems.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
 Our intellectual property consists of brands and their related trademarks and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles.

 Our other intellectual property is primarily in the form of trademarks and domain names. We also hold rights to several website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.growlifeinc.com, www.growlifeeco.com and www.greners.com.
 
 We have a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and some of our vendors and customers as necessary.
 
  Government Regulation
 
 Currently, there are twenty eight states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. There are currently seven states that allow recreational use of cannabis. As of the date of this writing, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products from GrowLife. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the GrowLife companies.
 
 All this being said, many reports show that the majority of the American public is in favor of making medical cannabis available as a controlled substance to those patients who need it. The need and consumption will then require cultivators to continue to provide safe and compliant crops to consumers. The cultivators will then need to build facilities and use consumable products, which GrowLife provides.
 
  THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK
  
  Our common stock traded on the grey market under the symbol “PHOT” through February 17, 2016. While the company was without a market maker, its stock does trade directly between buyers and sellers on the grey sheets. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown or commission, and may not represent actual transactions. Consequently, the information provided below was not be indicative of our common stock price under different conditions.
  
  On February 18, 2016, our common stock resumed unsolicited quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving clearance from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on our Form 15c2-11. We are currently taking the appropriate steps to uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with market makers as soon as it is able.
 
  PRIMARY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
  
 We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, our need for additional financing, the sale of significant numbers of our shares, the potential adjustment in the exercise price of our convertible debentures and a volatile market price for our common stock.
