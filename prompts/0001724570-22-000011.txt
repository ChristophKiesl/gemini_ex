 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
General
Our Mission
Our mission is to create enterprise-grade technology for small and medium businesses ("SMBs") delivered through our growing, global network of managed service provider ("MSP") partners.
Overview
Datto Holding Corp. ("Datto Holding", "Datto", “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company”) is the leading global provider of security and cloud-based software solutions purpose-built for delivery through the MSP channel to SMBs. MSPs represent the future of information technology ("IT") management for SMBs. Digital transformation is driving SMB adoption of modern software and technology, while regulatory and data protection requirements and proliferating security threats are increasing the complexity and risk of IT for SMBs. These trends have created an inflection point in SMB outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, serving as a single provider to meet all of an SMB’s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure, implement and manage software and technology stacks that support their SMB customers’ business needs. The number of MSPs continues to grow, with approximately 132,000 MSPs providing this critical function to millions of SMBs worldwide today. 
We are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. Our MSP-centric platform enables our partners to generate recurring revenue through the sale of our solutions to SMBs and to scale and effectively manage their own businesses. Our relationships are directly with our MSP partners. We are the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, and believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating as it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and reinforces our position as an integral component of our MSP partners’ businesses.
Our cloud-based offerings include Unified Continuity, Networking, Endpoint Management and Business Management software solutions. Our Unified Continuity, Networking and Endpoint Management offerings ensure the ongoing availability and security of mission-critical IT systems for SMBs in both private and public clouds. These solutions are simple for MSPs to deploy, configure and manage across their SMB customers through a single portal. Our Business Management software provides critical operational tools to MSPs for efficient workflow management and delivery of end-to-end managed services. Our platform also includes a host of business development tools, training and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMB customers.
We employ a land-and-expand business model and grow as our MSP partners grow. We seek to deliver tools and resources that are easy to adopt and enable recurring revenue growth and margin efficiency for our MSP partners. Our partners can expand their footprint with us on a frictionless basis as they increase the number of SMB customers they serve, they expand the number of Datto products that they sell through to their SMB customers, or their SMB customers add employees, applications and endpoints. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our dollar-based net retention rate was 116% and 111%, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Metrics” for additional information regarding our dollar-based net retention rate.
We have a highly efficient go-to-market model, in which we leverage our sales force and the power of our brand to attract, retain and grow our MSP partners. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 18,500 MSP partners, of which over 1,400 accounted for annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, of $100,000 or more each. MSP partners with over $100,000 of ARR accounted for 49% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 our 10 largest partners represented approximately 3% of our ARR and no single partner represented more than 0.5% of our ARR. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Metrics” for additional information regarding ARR.
Our business has experienced rapid growth since inception and generates revenue that is highly recurring. As of December 31, 2021, our ARR was $658.4 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $618.7 million, of which approximately 93% was recurring subscription revenue. As of December 31, 2020, our ARR was $542.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $518.8 million, of which approximately 94% was recurring subscription revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net income was $51.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net income (loss) adjusted for interest and other expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, provision for (benefit from) income tax, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and transaction related and other expense, was $175.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income was $22.5 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $150.5 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Adjusted EBITDA” for additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA.
Industry Background
MSPs represent the future of IT management for SMBs. As dedicated technology experts, MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, providing a single source to meet all of an SMB’s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure and implement software and technology stacks for their SMB customers. After implementation, MSPs provide ongoing value to SMBs through strategic guidance, technical support, monitoring and maintenance of their full IT environments.
A number of industry and technology trends are greatly increasing the complexity of the IT challenges faced by SMBs, leading SMBs to outsource their IT management to MSPs. These trends include:
•SMBs are increasingly adopting digital and cloud-based technologies. In response to competitive pressures and the demands of customers and employees, businesses are increasingly adopting digital and cloud-based technologies to help them transform their operations and compete in the marketplace. Even traditionally offline businesses are increasingly embracing technology to help them more efficiently market to, transact with and support customers, as well as to run their own operations. With the democratization of technology, SMBs are under pressure to adopt digital solutions with enterprise-grade capabilities or risk being disrupted by their competitors. We believe that new business challenges arising from the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic contributed to the acceleration of the digital transformation of SMBs. According to the International Data Corporation's ("IDC") Worldwide Small and Medium-Sized Business 2022 Predictions, 70% of SMBs will have significantly increased their IT spending by 2026 in order to become more digitally resilient and capitalize on changed market conditions. IDC also predicted that by 2024, 75% of start-ups will have a digital-first strategy, either adopting next-generation technologies, placing high emphasis on innovation, or focusing on digital disruption. 
•Modern technologies are driving complexity in IT. The accelerating pace of technological advancement and proliferation of software and technology offerings are increasing the difficulty for businesses to evaluate, select and implement an optimal IT environment. With the adoption of modern technologies, IT systems have become increasingly linked to business operations and to each other through complex integrations, greatly heightening the importance of effective IT management.
•SMB exposure to security and regulatory risk is increasing. SMBs are increasingly collecting, generating and storing data to perform mission-critical functions. Recognizing the criticality and potential value of this data, bad actors are increasingly targeting SMBs to exploit their perceived security vulnerabilities. According to IDC, by 2024, 33% of SMBs will experience security breaches quarterly, causing business disruptions of at least one week per quarter. Moreover, SMB data is potentially subject to a variety of ever-evolving regulatory regimes, creating the additional challenge of ensuring ongoing compliance.
•SMBs are not equipped to meet the expanding challenges of IT management. Despite requiring certain capabilities of enterprise-grade technology solutions, SMBs lack the time, resources and expertise to deploy, manage and maintain an enterprise-grade IT stack. SMBs historically have been unable to attract or retain sufficient in-house IT resources. This problem has only been exacerbated with the recent trend of technology professional labor shortages. Grappling with the day-to-day management of IT also takes time and resources away from advancing core business goals.
•The costs of downtime or data loss are meaningful and expanding. With increasingly digital operations, system downtime or data loss can result in lost revenue, customer churn, negative brand perception and reduced employee productivity. For SMBs, these losses could be catastrophic, with the potential to result in significant business disruptions or even bankruptcy, driving the need for comprehensive and effective enterprise-grade continuity solutions.
Our Differentiated Approach
We are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating because it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and ensures we become an integral component of our MSP partners’ businesses. Our approach, combined with our expansive platform, has helped to establish us as the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, with an extensive network of more than 18,500 MSP partners. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large, but fragmented, SMB IT market.
Our Unified Continuity, Networking and Endpoint Management solutions generate recurring revenue for MSPs as part of their managed services for SMBs. MSPs integrate these solutions into managed services that they offer to their SMB customers on their own terms, including pricing, packaging, billing and solution-bundling, giving MSPs greater control over growth and profitability of their managed services. We also provide visibility and predictability to our MSP partners by delivering our solutions on a subscription basis.
Our Business Management offerings further this overall value proposition, enabling MSPs to scale and optimize the workflows and business processes associated with managed services delivery. Our solutions are purpose-built to address the specific needs of MSPs, enabling them to improve customer satisfaction, increase productivity, decrease response times and reduce costs, enhancing the overall profitability of their businesses.
Our platform also features business development tools and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMBs. We do not directly market or sell to SMBs to avoid competing with our MSP partners. Instead, we offer MSPs tools for marketing automation and content for marketing programs, as well as training and certifications. We further cultivate the broader MSP ecosystem through our thought leadership efforts and industry-leading events. Our open ecosystem events, such as DattoCon and MSP Technology Days, are among the largest MSP events in the world.
Our singular dedication to our partners has enabled us to create a network of more than 18,500 MSPs that rely upon Datto solutions to serve over 1.5 million SMBs, in each case as of December 31, 2021. Our model of distribution through this network of MSPs mitigates the challenges of addressing the SMB market and provides us with the following benefits:

•Sales leverage. The MSP channel creates enormous sales leverage for us to address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. With each of our sales representatives capable of reaching dozens of MSPs, who in turn can serve hundreds of SMBs, the reach of our sales force is greatly amplified.
•Recurring revenue durability. Our direct contractual relationships with MSP partners insulate us from SMB churn from bankruptcy, consolidation or other adverse events. In the event of SMB customer loss, the associated MSP will often maintain their revenue stream by migrating that customer’s Datto stack to a different customer.
•Natural revenue expansion. Once we are engaged with an MSP, our revenue expands naturally as that MSP adds existing and new SMB customers to our platform, those SMBs add new employees, applications and endpoints, the MSP upgrades service tiers or purchases more of our solutions to meet growing data protection or networking needs and the MSP cross-sells additional Datto solutions into its customer base. 
•Support and service leverage. We provide 24/7 direct-to-tech support to our MSP partners, who are responsible for providing higher touch implementation and ongoing support services to their SMB customers. This approach allows us to avoid the significant cost associated with providing support and service activities to over 1.5 million SMBs.

Key Benefits to Our MSP Partners
MSPs choose Datto and develop longstanding relationships with us not only for our innovative solutions but also for our comprehensive platform, which delivers the following key benefits to our MSP partners:
•Enable shift to managed IT services. By providing solutions specifically designed for delivery in a bundled suite of critical managed services, we facilitate the shift of IT services organizations to a recurring managed services model. With our platform, MSPs generate recurring revenue through the sale of our software and technology to SMBs on a subscription basis and thereby gain clear visibility into and predictability of revenue. Our suite of products provides our MSP partners with multiple avenues to land new customers and expand recurring revenue over time.
•Increase retention of SMB customers. Any time an SMB experiences a security downtime or data loss event, an MSP runs the risk of losing that customer. For this reason, MSPs seek reliable solutions that reduce the risk of SMB downtime and data loss. With our solutions, MSPs gain a last line of defense against security threats that ensures ongoing availability and comprehensive data protection, providing their SMB customers with peace of mind. Datto solutions have proven to be very reliable for MSP partners in enabling the efficient management of their customer base, preventing downtime and recovering from cyberattacks and data loss events. As a result, the MSP’s role in securing SMBs’ mission-critical systems solidifies the MSP’s importance as a trusted partner to SMBs.
•Increase profit generation from SMB customers. Our solutions are competitively priced to enable our MSP partners to generate attractive profit margins. The pricing of our solutions for MSPs is generally based on a predetermined tier for a given solution, ensuring our MSP partners have visibility into delivery cost. The pricing of our solutions is not available to SMBs and our MSP partners have latitude to set the pricing, packaging and bundling of our solutions as a managed offering to their customers. As a result, our MSP partners can leverage our solutions to create reliable profit centers for their businesses.
•Avoid channel conflict. Unlike most technology and software vendors who sell to both MSPs and SMB customers, Datto does not compete with MSPs. Datto’s MSP-centric approach enables us to focus solely on the needs of MSPs, designing our platform and solutions for this market. We provide MSPs with the tools and support they need to create and sell managed services to their SMB customers and the assurance we will not compete directly for the business of SMBs.
•Reduce the cost of managing SMB customer IT environments. Our remote monitoring and management product enables the delivery of end-to-end managed IT services by allowing MSPs to perform proactive monitoring, preventative maintenance and remote remediation of customer systems, applications and devices in real-time with intelligent alerting, auto-response and auto-resolution. Our cloud-based solutions help MSPs achieve better resource utilization by reducing costly truck rolls for on-site service and freeing up resources to pursue higher value activities.
•Enable operational efficiency. Our business management tools are easy to implement and use, enabling MSPs to operate their own businesses more efficiently through centralized operations from a single pane of glass. These software solutions are optimized for the business needs of MSPs to enable workflow automation and deliver actionable insights, providing full visibility into customer IT environments. Our solutions have embedded integrations with other Datto products and other services and technologies to make it easier for an MSP to manage a heterogeneous technology stack.
•Drive business growth. In addition to our products, our platform also includes a range of sales and marketing content, training and other programs as well as technical certifications tailored to our MSP partners to help them more effectively grow their businesses, alleviating a major pain-point for IT professionals with limited sales and marketing experience.
Our Growth Strategy
We pursue numerous actions to drive our growth in subscription revenue. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Expand our partner base by adding new MSPs. We believe that there is substantial opportunity to increase our penetration among MSPs. We intend to continue leveraging the strong awareness of our brand as a trusted partner to the MSP community to add new MSPs in the markets we serve. We have expanded our MSP partner base from approximately 17,000 at December 31, 2020 to over 18,500 at December 31, 2021.
•Standardize MSP partners on our platform. Once an MSP partner joins our platform, our goal is to increase the penetration of our solutions across its existing SMB customer base. Typically, MSPs initially deploy our solutions to only a limited number of their SMB customers. Over time, MSPs often continue to migrate additional existing end-customers to our platform for the benefit of managing a single integrated solution stack. We aim to aid in this migration in order to increase our overall penetration into our MSP partners’ existing SMB customer base.
•Empower our MSP partners to attract more SMBs. As SMBs increasingly rely on MSPs for IT management, we seek to grow our revenue by helping our existing MSP partners attract additional SMB customers that may ultimately adopt our solutions. We plan to continue developing marketing automation tools and content for marketing, as well as offering training and certifications, in order to facilitate our MSP partners’ growth.
•Facilitate upsell and cross-sell activity with our MSP partners and their SMB customers. We intend to grow our sales teams in order to increase our sales with our MSP partners. Our sales teams upsell our MSP partners to higher service tier subscriptions as the data retention and bandwidth needs of their SMB customers grow. Upsell activity can also occur every time our MSP partners' SMB customers add new employees, applications or endpoints, expanding the addressable subscription scaling units for our products. In addition, our sales teams upsell our MSP partners to increase their Business Management subscriptions as they grow. Our sales teams also actively cross-sell our products to our MSP partners, leveraging their positive experiences with our platform. Our dollar-based net retention rate, which was 116% as of December 31, 2021 and 111% as of December 31, 2020, demonstrates our ability to expand within existing MSP partners.
•Extend our product leadership and introduce new platform solutions. We continue to invest in new purpose-built product and service offerings to anticipate and meet the evolving demands of our MSP partners and their SMB customers. We will also continue to pursue opportunistic mergers and acquisitions to complement and enhance our current solution set.
•Expand our international footprint. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand into new international geographies, with approximately 70% of our revenue coming from the United States ("U.S.") in 2021. The maturity of the international SMB IT landscape varies; more mature markets represent growth opportunities in the near term, while less mature markets present a longer-term opportunity as MSPs develop within those markets.
Our Products
Our products include offerings in Unified Continuity, Networking, Endpoint Management and Business Management.

Unified Continuity Products
Datto Unified Continuity is a complete line of products that protect workloads — data, applications and configurations — located on laptops, workstations, physical and virtual servers and in the public cloud. Our suite of cloud-based products protect and restore workloads, reduce SMB downtime resulting from data or system loss and provide a last line of defense against security threats. These products include:
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery ("BCDR"). MSPs use our all-in-one BCDR products to efficiently protect servers and workstations and minimize downtime for SMBs. SIRIS, Datto’s flagship cloud-managed BCDR product, consists of a state-of-the-art physical or virtual device deployed by MSPs at a customer location or in a private data center, the agent software installed on protected servers and workstations and a cloud-based storage, virtualization and management system. SIRIS is available in service tiers ranging from one to 100 terabytes with a variety of data retention options.
Once an MSP deploys SIRIS, the agent software automatically transfers disk images of the protected machines to the SIRIS device at configurable intervals, as frequently as every five minutes. SIRIS verifies the integrity of every image and transfers a copy of that image to the secure Datto Cloud at selected intervals. In this manner, SIRIS establishes a last line of defense for all protected servers and workstations. In the event of a server or workstation security incident or outage, users can initiate a boot of the virtual image of the affected machines either in the SIRIS device or in the Datto Cloud in as little as six seconds.
In addition to SIRIS, BCDR products also include ALTO, a smaller capacity BCDR solution. Available in 2 terabyte and smaller capacity models, ALTO provides many of the same capabilities of SIRIS without local virtualization on the device. The same agents are used to collect server or workstation images and ALTO is managed from the same management portal in the Datto Cloud, but with ALTO all failover virtualization occurs only in the Datto Cloud.
Datto Continuity for Microsoft Azure ("DCMA"). Datto Continuity for Microsoft Azure is an extension of Datto's flagship BCDR product line, focused squarely on protecting data in Microsoft's public cloud. This first-of-its-kind product uses Datto's industry leading technology, but is built and deployed natively in the cloud. DCMA delivers full platform independence from Microsoft, superior insulation from ransomware attacks, elimination of single cloud outage risk, and true business continuity to minimize the potential for downtime. Datto delivers this new technology with its familiar approach for MSPs: a fixed, predictable monthly price (e.g., no egress fees), an integrated and intuitive single user interface that enables on-premise, private cloud and public cloud workloads to be easily operated together as a hybrid cloud, and 24x7 technical support for our MSP partners.

Cloud Continuity. Cloud Continuity is an extension of Datto's flagship BCDR product line with a focus on the PC market. The COVID-19 pandemic fueled growth of the PC market over the last two years and has significantly expanded this market opportunity. This product line marries the core Datto all-in-one, image-based continuity solution and adds on a key innovation - it replicates data directly to the Datto Cloud, without the need for any hardware or virtual appliance on the local network. In the event of a ransomware attack, device loss or theft, or any other event that impacts the data on the PC, Cloud Continuity allows MSPs to quickly and easily restore the full disk image, or any specific files with a simple recovery approach.
SaaS Protection +. SaaS Protection + includes Datto SaaS Protection and Datto SaaS Defense. Datto SaaS Protection is a reliable, automated and secure backup and restoration product for Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace data. Microsoft and Google currently recommend the use of a third-party backup service because Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace do not directly backup user data. MSPs deploy SaaS Protection seamlessly for their SMB customers in a few simple steps, and can quickly start to take regular backups of user emails, files and sites, storing these backups in the Datto Cloud. MSPs help end-users easily recover from data loss, including ransomware attacks, accidental or malicious deletion and cancelled employee accounts—all from our cloud management portal. Datto SaaS Defense is an advanced threat protection solution that detects zero-day threats at the first encounter. SaaS Defense’s data-independent technology detects unknown threats that other solutions miss by analyzing the composition of an email, chat, or document instead of only scanning for known security threats. SaaS Defense provides robust threat protection for Microsoft 365 applications, including Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. 
Workplace. Datto Workplace is a complete cloud-hosted file sync and share solution enabling end-users to synchronize files across platforms, including mobile devices. Workplace also serves as a collaboration platform allowing users to share and work together on any type of document in its native file format. Centralized cloud management and sophisticated administrative controls at the end-user and group levels give MSPs and their SMB customers control over file governance. Critical business files are also protected via the ransomware detection and management feature, which gives users the ability to immediately revert back to safe file copies from before an infection, undoing the ransomware encryption of user data.
File Protection. Datto File Protection is an MSP-managed, secure and scalable backup product that enables MSPs to efficiently protect and recover files and folders on workstations and laptops of all types. File and folder backups protect unstructured data from ever-present threats such as human error, hardware failure, ransomware and lost or stolen devices. Users can quickly and easily access and restore their own files from the Datto Cloud, enabling them to recover from common data-loss scenarios without raising a support request, or MSPs can securely access customer accounts and restore data on their behalf.
Networking Products
Datto Networking delivers a suite of cloud-managed networking products for MSPs to efficiently deploy to their SMB customers. Networking products currently include:
Access Points. Our WiFi access points deliver high-powered wireless mesh networks with seamless roaming. These 802.11AX access points include quad-core processors to ensure all of the WiFi 6 features have the necessary processing power to deliver the performance required by SMBs.
Switches. We offer switches with 8, 24 and 48 port options, switching capacity ranging from 20 Gbps to 104 Gbps, and mounting options ranging from fanless desktop to rack mounted. MSPs can choose the form factor, performance and mounting options most appropriate for a particular SMB customer.
Edge Routers. Our Edge Routers provide core functionality including intrusion detection and prevention and a firewall with stateful packet inspection, layer 7 DPI, port forwarding, DMZ host and VLAN segregation.
Endpoint Management Products

Remote Monitoring and Management. A key component of an MSP’s security best practices, Datto RMM is a remote monitoring and management product designed to assist MSPs with their IT service delivery. Built for MSPs as a multi-tenant solution to manage millions of SMB customer endpoints in an efficient manner, Datto RMM is a fully cloud-managed, scalable SaaS product with integrated endpoint ransomware detection. The underlying architecture provides MSPs with the ability to remotely audit, patch, manage, monitor, support and report on SMB customers’ local and public-cloud deployed endpoints. The platform offers a collection of tools for securely supporting thousands of devices without the need for extensive training. MSPs can use Datto RMM tools to create their own scripts, or easily plug in hundreds of pre-made scripts, to automate repetitive tasks like software patching or rapidly respond to security incidents with pre-defined actions. Integrations with Autotask PSA and other frequently-used solutions allow MSPs to seamlessly report on device status, issues and events. Using configurable dashboards, a simple menu system, remote takeover capability and the flexibility to operate from any internet-connected device, Datto RMM helps MSPs deliver better service and increase responsiveness for their SMB customers.
Business Management Products
Datto Business Management consists of integrated SaaS offerings that enable MSPs to be more efficient at scale, including:
Autotask Professional Services Automation. Autotask PSA is a complete IT business management product that is purpose-built for MSPs and delivers the mission-critical tools an MSP needs to run its business. Continuing to deliver 99.99% uptime in 2021, Autotask PSA pioneered cloud-delivered PSA and provides dashboards that help MSPs turn data into actionable business insights. It enables partners to monitor their sales pipeline, track technician productivity and evaluate customer profitability. It includes device management, ticketing, project management, customer relationship management, invoicing, inventory management and resource management. In addition, our open architecture application programming interface ("API") has enabled more than 200 industry-leading vendors to integrate their business-critical applications with Autotask PSA to further simplify workflows for MSPs. Autotask PSA centralizes business operations and enables quick, data-driven decisions through rich dashboards, customizable alerts and business intelligence tools.
Datto Commerce. Datto Commerce is an intuitive, cloud-based sales platform built for MSPs. It includes quoting, procurement and ecommerce tools for MSPs to drive efficiency and profit margins. The Datto Commerce platform automates procurement with supplier data feeds, allows MSPs to create and send branded quotes to their SMB customers, and provides configurable e-commerce store-fronts for MSPs to offer to their customers. Datto Commerce also integrates with Autotask PSA and other leading PSA platforms and accounting packages.

In this way, MSPs can provide secure enterprise-grade technology to their SMB customers without the hassles of deploying, integrating and managing enterprise products.
•Datto product integrations. We pioneered an integrated product portfolio tailored uniquely for MSPs. While Autotask PSA and Datto RMM can be offered as stand-alone products, they are also integrated with each other, allowing technicians to move seamlessly between our PSA and RMM. Integration between Datto RMM and our Networking solutions allows rapid troubleshooting and problem resolution of network issues. Integration between BCDR and PSA allows the PSA to collect and report on deployed devices and manage related support tickets. These integrations encourage MSPs to standardize across our solutions.
•Third-party product integrations. Datto supports an open technology ecosystem for MSPs. MSPs value using different tools from multiple vendors to deliver their managed services, creating unique and often differentiating technology stacks. Datto products are externally integrated with other products to make it easier for an MSP to manage a heterogeneous technology stack. Leveraging open APIs, third party vendors have built more than 200 integrations with our business management products. This includes everything from security tools to competitive remote monitoring and management and professional services automation vendors.
•Two-level multi-tenant architecture. All of our products share a two-tier multi-tenant design, which facilitates MSP management of both their own and the SMBs’ environments. The first tier provides secure resource sharing among MSP partner accounts hosted on the Datto Cloud, while the second tier sits below each MSP account and provides a tenant-centric view of SMB customers for the MSP partner. Most other multi-tenant systems provide only a single level of tenant management.
•Private virtualization and storage cloud. Datto operates its own exabyte scale private cloud which provides us with control over the environment, efficient operating costs and flexibility to best support our partners. The Datto Cloud provides both compute and storage tiers at multiple geographically distributed data centers. This includes the option to replicate a second copy of SMB customer data to an alternative data center in region. We have developed a differentiated virtual machine ("VM") orchestration layer which allows shared management between our MSP partner and the Datto support organization. 
•Proprietary work-flow engine. Autotask PSA incorporates a field-configurable business logic engine that allows the implementation of business processes without costly code customization. A single multi-tenant cloud architecture delivers scalable efficient deployment of custom workflows for each MSP partner, and enables partners to trigger actions and alerts based on real time internal data as well as data from third party products. This allows MSPs to deploy PSA to meet the needs of their business, rather than redesigning their business to meet the requirements of their chosen management software.
•Proprietary agent and agentless technology. We have developed several proprietary agents across our product lines, specifically BCDR, RMM and Cloud Continuity. Our Unified Continuity agents protect servers, workstations and PCs by deploying an endpoint resident software package or using an agentless approach for virtual machines and private clouds. We have developed both a robust agent and an agentless plugin that support virtual machine backup on Hyper-V and VMware. We have also developed RMM agents and API integrations that enable MSPs to monitor and manage SMB customer endpoints on premise and in the public cloud. By developing this proprietary technology, we can avoid reliance on third-party licensed backup agents.
•Proprietary remote access technology. Datto RMM incorporates near-instantaneous access to managed endpoints using 100% HTML5 technology with no local plugin required on the managed device. Not only is this technology secure and fast, it delivers cross browser compatibility. This enables technicians to address customer tickets from nearly any browser, including mobile devices and tablets. With better performance than third-party licensed options, Datto RMM also enables MSPs to deliver faster, more responsive service to their SMB customers.
•Proprietary virtual machine image verification technology. Our verification technology provides evidence that backups produced by our BCDR products are viable. This technology performs automated tests on every image for ransomware and disk integrity. “Screenshot” verification boots the virtual machine either on the device or in the cloud and performs additional automated testing for viability. This running instance of the protected virtual machine further allows the MSP partner to utilize our scripting API to run custom test scripts that validate functionality and data integrity beyond what can be normally evaluated through the built-in testing. This functionally is linked back through the multi-tenant portal and alerting system to provide the MSP partner with confirmation that their managed systems are protected.
•Cloud to cloud API-level connectivity. In addition to devices deployed on-premises, the Datto Cloud is designed to ingest data directly from SaaS applications hosted in public clouds. This API-level connectivity brokered through our multi-tenant portal provides the same level of management that our MSP partners expect from the hybrid cloud continuity products. We have worked with Microsoft and Google to make efficient use of Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace APIs and achieve efficient data ingest and restore services.
•Proprietary remote synchronization technology. Datto has developed proprietary synchronization technology across a wide range of use cases to allow SMB PCs and devices to efficiently and securely send data to the Datto Cloud without saturating local internet connections. This includes multi-pass synchronization technology that enables local workloads to continue to operate while a backup is taken and transmitted. It also includes file synchronization software, as well as differential assessment, transmission and verification capabilities to enable an MSP to control the transmission and verification of large data sets to the Datto Cloud.
•RMM integrated cloud-managed networking devices. By combining the network cloud API with RMM management dashboards, the Datto RMM engine is able to provide access to network configuration and runtime data that greatly exceeds off-the-shelf solutions reliant on SNMP for device connectivity. This cloud-level integration provides much greater control of Datto Networking devices than can be achieved by combining products from different networking and remote monitoring and management vendors. As a result, MSP technicians solving SMB customer tickets experience a seamless environment, increasing productivity and responsiveness.
•Proprietary embedded RMM Ransomware Detection. One of the largest security threats for MSPs and their SMB customers is ransomware, and Datto RMM now incorporates the first embedded ransomware detection algorithm into deployed RMM agents. On all Datto RMM managed devices, the agent now observes the local system for signs of crypto ransomware. When identified, the agent attempts to stop the encryption process and automatically isolates the system from the network, alerting the MSP to the infection. This allows MSPs to prevent the spread of ransomware, and proactively restore infected systems.
•Hyper-converged hybrid cloud connected edge device. Datto is differentiated in that it deploys a true hyper-converged continuity appliance that combines data storage with local compute capabilities. Alternative continuity systems generally only provide gateway functionality with virtualization occurring either exclusively in the cloud or on other equipment furnished by end-customers on-premises. Datto allows very flexible orchestration of VM instances in either the cloud or on the edge device. 
Our Partners
Datto creates technology for MSPs, enabling them to deliver managed services to their SMB customers and also enabling MSPs to efficiently operate their own businesses. MSPs represent substantially all of our revenue and are referred to as our “partners.” Our MSP partners purchase our products on a subscription basis for inclusion in managed services sold to their end-customers in a recurring revenue model or for their own use. Our MSP partners range in size from very small to mid-sized, and primarily serve SMBs, often managing an SMB customer’s entire IT environment. In smaller MSPs, the business owner or CEO is typically the purchaser of Datto products, and in larger MSPs, the purchaser is often the Vice President of Product or Chief Technology Officer.
Our Unified Continuity, Networking and Endpoint Management products are purchased by MSPs for resale to their SMB customers as part of their managed services offerings, with subscription fees based on workloads or applications protected through our BCDR products, the number of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace employee accounts at the SMB domains that our MSP partners protect through our SaaS Protection+ products, or the number of endpoints managed and protected through our RMM platform. Generally, an MSP first purchases a subscription to assess our products and evaluate whether to include them in their managed service offering. Following a successful initial assessment, the MSP typically adds to their subscriptions to cover additional workloads, applications, seats and endpoints for its customers over time. Our Business Management products are purchased by an MSP for their own use, with subscription fees based on their number of seats. 
As of December 31, 2021, we partnered with more than 18,500 MSPs serving over 1.5 million SMBs. We count partners as MSPs with active subscriptions for one or more of our products at the end of the measured period. Our revenue is highly diversified across our entire partner base, with no single partner making up more than 0.5% of our ARR. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 1,400 MSP partners that each contributed more than $100,000 of ARR.

Examples of use cases of MSP partners leveraging our solutions to deliver value to their SMB customers include:
•utilizing our BCDR solutions to help an SMB roll back its IT environment after a phishing e-mail and ransomware has compromised that SMB’s systems;
•upon a server failure, helping an SMB to switch over to our local device until that SMB’s environment has been restored;
•enabling an SMB to operate its environment in our cloud in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake;
•after an end-customer accidentally misplaces a laptop, helping the customer restore the lost environment onto new hardware;
•recovering data and files from our cloud when a customer accidentally deletes a file from Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace;
•utilizing Datto Networking solutions to provide production, point of sale, network connectivity and guest Wi-Fi services for a conference or event; and
•using the Datto partner portal to remotely diagnose and fix an SMB’s laptop issues.
Competition
We operate in a dynamic industry driven by the technology needs of SMBs and MSPs. Our competition is generally comprised of MSP-focused vendors, enterprise IT vendors and emerging innovators with niche point solutions. These competitors include:
•Continuity vendors that provide image-based backup solutions with on-premise only, cloud-only or hybrid infrastructure. The level of continuity provided by image-based backup vendors varies widely, from simple image copy to complex image orchestration, copy, failover and failback. Many vendors providing continuity solutions are not exclusively focused on serving MSPs and require customers to procure their own cloud. 
•Networking vendors that sell a mix of edge routers, WiFi access points and switches to small, medium and large businesses. Typically, these vendors deliver either enterprise scale products at a high price point, or commodity products at a low price point. Enterprise scale products are designed for the many unique demands of large-scale enterprises and are complex to configure and manage. Commodity hardware vendors provide performant products with fewer features at a lower price point, often not designed for MSP deployment and management. 
•Business management and endpoint management software vendors that focus a significant portion of their business on the MSP market provide vertically integrated service management platforms and tools to MSPs to help them operate more efficiently. Many of these vendors are not solely focused on the MSP market, sell directly to end customers to augment their revenue and operate software platforms that are not cloud native. 
Key competitive factors in our market include:
•reliability, security and performance of solutions that protect workloads — data, applications and configurations — and ensure uptime for SMBs;
•MSP-centric, turnkey product capabilities including reliability, multi-tenant cloud management, ease of deployment and manageability at scale;
•ability to provide recurring revenue and margin for MSPs;
•quality and availability of service and support;
•brand awareness, reputation and influence among MSPs; and
•programs, tools and content that help MSPs grow their businesses.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing and sales approach begins with our leading content marketing programs that attract MSPs, nurturing these contacts and then efficiently delivering qualified leads to our sales team to close. Once a new MSP is added to our platform, our sales team works with them to help them grow. Using our go-to-market enablement programs, MSPs add new SMBs, upsell into their existing SMB customers as they add new employees, applications or endpoints, and cross-sell additional Datto products. Post-sales engagement with our service and success teams ensures partners are either effectively using or are enabled to resell our products, and ongoing relationship management at scale allows our partners to sell, upsell and cross-sell more of our products.
Marketing
Our marketing engine delivers industry-leading content, which drives our target audience—MSP business owners and decision makers—to request a demo or become a partner. We distribute our content through a number of digital marketing platforms (social, pay-per-click, search engine optimization, syndication, webinars), and we leverage demos to nurture and further qualify leads. Analytics of this process enable us to fine tune programs and content to drive more successful and qualified lead generation.
We categorize our leads based on propensity to buy using a real-time analytical model. We leverage high touch tactics to attract the higher scoring leads and rely on self-service at the low end. We market Datto as the MSP technology company, creating technology for SMBs delivered by MSPs. Once an MSP becomes a Datto partner, we help it grow with a variety of programs to ensure they are optimally using the products they purchased and are enabled to resell our products through to SMB customers. Our marketing programs also help our partners attract new SMB customers. We leverage our in-depth knowledge and understanding of MSPs to design these free programs, which include a marketing automation tool, robust marketing content, sales training and certifications.
We also foster one of the largest MSP communities in the world through our numerous events. DattoCon and MSP Technology Days are among the largest MSP events in the world. In 2021, our dedicated community development team hosted over 150 Datto virtual and in-person events for our partners and prospects around the globe, educating them on best practices, refreshing them on the latest technology and providing insights they can use to grow their businesses. We also exhibit at third-party in person and virtual tradeshows where we continue to engage with MSPs and expand the Datto brand. We believe that fostering a cohesive MSP community and serving as a trusted thought leader for MSPs around the world helps drive MSP growth, which in turn drives Datto growth. These events, combined with our content and digital marketing strategies, help ensure that our partners stay in touch with our brand, maintaining our lead in the MSP market.
Sales
We believe that leveraging the MSP channel creates high levels of sales productivity at low customer acquisition costs, allowing us to efficiently reach SMBs. We add MSP partners to our platform primarily through our sales team. There are three sales teams pursuing new MSP partners and covering our existing partner base: Sales Development Representatives ("SDRs"), MSP Acquisition Representatives ("Hunters") and MSP Growth Representatives ("Farmers"). SDRs review leads from our marketing team and qualify new partner opportunities, and Hunters are responsible for pursuing and closing these opportunities, leading to a new MSP partner adopting one or more of our products. Farmers work with our partners after their first purchase and build relationships, focusing on increasing the penetration of and upselling existing products, as well as cross-selling additional products. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC.

Our MSP partners become multipliers to our sales team with our Unified Continuity, Networking and Endpoint Management products. With aligned incentives, our Farmers and our partners’ own sales teams work together at scale using a range of “sell with” tactics along with the enablement and training resources available on our marketing platform to help such partners grow their base of SMB customers purchasing managed services powered by Datto solutions and expand their footprint within those customers. 
Services, Success and Support
Services and Success
Our services team onboards MSP partners, helps them properly configure and implement our solutions and trains them to use our products to their fullest potential. Our success team provides cross-functional support for partners to drive increased adoption, product usage and subscription renewals and is responsible for relationship and escalation management.
Support
Our support team includes experienced, trained resources located around the world to provide 24x7x365 technical support for all our products. Support is included in all our offerings as long as an MSP partner’s subscription is active. All support tiers offer maintenance releases, patches and access to our support services and portal, including a documentation and knowledge repository, how-to guides, videos and a community where our partners can ask questions and find answers. Our support is distinguished by our “direct to tech” support model whereby our expert technicians immediately answer support calls and speak directly with partners to resolve issues. This includes “code red” support where we work with an MSP partner during a disaster or other incident to minimize disruption to their customer’s business.
Similar to the sales leverage we gain through the MSP channel, our partners also are a multiplier for our support team because they perform first-level technical support with SMBs, only calling Datto when they are unable to resolve an issue. In complex situations such as multiple or repeat issues affecting an MSP, our success team may get involved in an escalation. Our executive leaders also regularly speak with partners as part of our commitment to openness and accessibility.
Product Development
Product development and innovation are at the core of our business. We not only invent technology, but we also reinvent it for MSPs. Our research and development teams are composed of product management, software development and infrastructure engineering functions. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing and delivery of our solutions. We build our products from inception to serve the needs of MSPs and their SMB customers and continually seek to improve those products.
We have designed our development processes to be highly responsive and cost-efficient. Our diversified global footprint allows us to source from a large pool of talented resources by participating in multiple labor markets. We utilize an Agile development process and small Scrum teams, each dedicated to specific product modules that follow a standard set of best practices and a common set of development values. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brands. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 35 issued U.S. patents, with expiration dates ranging from September 2025 to September 2040. We have also filed 15 patent applications in the United States which are pending, and four patent applications with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). We cannot be assured that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow the scope of the claims sought. We do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one of our patents, issued or pending.
We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and we control and monitor access to our software, proprietary technology and documents and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Human Capital 
Datto’s mission to create enterprise-grade technology for SMBs delivered through MSP partners begins with its commitment to Datto employees. We think that the innovation Datto provides to the MSP community is inextricably linked to our talented, world-class global workforce, and that our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled talent is critical to our future success and growth. As of 
December 31, 2021, we had 2,089 employees, of which 1,569 (75%) were employed in the United States and 520 (25%) were employed outside of the United States. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. 
Compensation & Benefits
Our rewards programs are designed to attract, reward, and retain our talented employees globally. We offer programs that are highly competitive, locally relevant and provide the resources needed to live a full and balanced life. Our compensation packages include base salary, opportunities for equity ownership, and commission or bonuses for selected roles. In addition, we offer an employee stock purchase plan, through which eligible employees may choose to buy Datto common stock at a discount twice a year.
Our benefits include comprehensive healthcare, income protection insurance, time off and leave programs, retirement programs and additional resources to support employees' overall well-being. Our health benefits include medical plans including telemedicine, dental plans, vision, flexible spending accounts, and health savings accounts. Our employees participate in flexible vacation policies, paid time off, and paid parental and family leave. We support our employees’ financial health with a 401(k) plan with company matching contributions, disability and life insurance. Employee well-being is further supported with access to an employee assistance program, subscriptions to well-being apps, virtual yoga and a robust recognition program.
We evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings on an annual basis to ensure competitiveness and we adjust our programs as needed. We believe these programs deliver compensation and benefits that are competitive with other companies with whom we compete for talent.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Datto, we are a global team. We strive to be a diverse and equitable workplace, where everyone is valued, included, and has equal access to growth and development opportunities to maximize their full potential. We value diverse perspectives and foster a culture of transparency and trust. We will listen to all voices and model inclusive behavior as essential to our core values. We will invest in and empower our employees and partners as they deliver mission critical technology to small and medium businesses.
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind. We believe that fostering this environment builds a foundation on which our employees are empowered to do their life's work. Our employee resource groups ("ERGs") are company-sponsored groups of employees that promote and support certain objectives including inclusion and diversity, career development and networking. As of December 31, 2021, we sponsored four ERGs: Datto Women in Technology, Datto Pride, Datto Culture, and Datto Familia. 
We require unconscious bias training across our entire organization. In addition, we support the development of our leadership team by embedding trainings on leading inclusively in all levels of our management and leadership development programs. We aim to ensure our employees are aware of different ways to notify management of inappropriate behavior, including through a confidential hotline. Any and all reports of inappropriate behavior are taken very seriously and thoroughly investigated and remediated. 
Employee Learning & Development

We offer high-quality learning experiences across our global business. This includes an extensive onboarding program, robust sales, product and technical training, as well as a comprehensive professional skills curriculum focused on managerial and leadership skills. We also launched an internal networking and mentoring program intended to connect employees across Datto to foster relationships, development and the exchange professional and personal experiences, skills, and career paths. Datto also has an extensive library of online, self-paced learning offerings enabling employees access to real-time learning targeted to their specific development needs.
