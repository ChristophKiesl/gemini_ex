ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical and medical device company focused on the development of novel therapeutics intended to address significant unmet medical needs in important acute care markets. Our development programs are primarily focused in the treatment of acute cardiovascular and acute pulmonary diseases. Our lead acute cardiovascular product candidate, istaroxime, is a first-in-class, dual-acting agent being developed to improve cardiac function in patients with acute heart failure, or AHF, with a potentially differentiated safety profile from existing treatments. Istaroxime demonstrated significant improvement in both diastolic and systolic aspects of cardiac function and was generally well tolerated in two phase 2 clinical trials. Istaroxime has been granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of AHF by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Based on the profile observed in the phase 2 clinical studies in AHF, where istaroxime significantly improved cardiac function and systolic blood pressure in heart failure patients, we initiated a small clinical study to evaluate istaroxime for the treatment of early cardiogenic shock, a severe form of heart failure characterized by very low blood pressure and hypo-perfusion to critical organs. We believe that istaroxime may fulfill an unmet need in early cardiogenic shock. In addition, our drug product candidates include rostafuroxin, a novel medicine for the treatment of hypertension in patients with a specific genetic profile, for which we are pursuing potential out-licensing transactions or other strategic opportunities and not advancing on our own. Our cardiovascular portfolio also includes early exploratory research programs to evaluate potential preclinical product candidates for development, including oral and intravenous sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase 2a, or SERCA2a, activator heart failure compounds.
 
Our lead pulmonary product candidate is our proprietary lyophilized KL4 surfactant (lucinactant), which we believe may potentially support a product pipeline, alone or in combination with our proprietary Aerosol Delivery System, or ADS, technology, to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. We are developing KL4 surfactant to be delivered either as a liquid instillate or noninvasively as an aerosol. In September 2020, the FDA accepted our investigational new drug, or IND, application for a small phase 2 pilot study to assess the ability of our KL4 surfactant liquid instillate to impact key respiratory parameters in the treatment of lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent in novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, infections. We dosed the first patient in this clinical trial in January 2021 and plan to enroll up to 20 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who are on mechanical ventilation, with results expected mid-2021. Our aerosolized product candidate, AEROSURF® (lucinactant for inhalation), is a novel drug/medical device combination product for noninvasive delivery of aerosolized KL4 surfactant using our ADS technology for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS, in premature infants. Our licensee in Asia, Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Ltd., or Lee’s (HK), has agreed to fund and conduct a phase 2b clinical bridging study for AEROSURF in Asia, referred to as the phase 2b bridging study, under the terms of our License, Development and Commercialization Agreement between us and Lee’s (HK) dated as of June 12, 2017, as amended, or the Asia License Agreement. Accordingly, we have suspended our AEROSURF clinical activities and ceased enrollment in the phase 2b bridging study being conducted in the European Union, or EU. To support the future development of AEROSURF and our lyophilized KL4 surfactant liquid instillate in markets outside of Asia, including the United States, or U.S., we are pursuing one or more licensing transactions, collaboration arrangements or other strategic opportunities.
 
Our ability to advance our development programs is dependent upon our ability to secure additional capital in both the near and long-term, through public or private equity offerings; through potential strategic opportunities, including licensing agreements, drug product development and marketing collaboration arrangements, pharmaceutical research cooperation arrangements or other similar transactions in geographic markets outside of Asia, including the U.S.; and/or through potential grants and other funding commitments from U.S. government agencies, in each case, if available. We have engaged with potential counterparties in various markets and will continue to pursue non-dilutive sources of capital as well as potential private and public offerings. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify and enter into public or private securities offerings on acceptable terms and in amounts sufficient to meet our needs, or qualify for non-dilutive funding opportunities under any grant programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies, private foundations and/or leading academic institutions, or identify and enter into any strategic transactions that will provide the additional capital that we will require. If none of these alternatives is available, or if available, we are unable to raise sufficient capital through such transactions, we potentially could be forced to limit or cease our development activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our Development Programs
 
The table below summarizes the current status and anticipated milestones for our principal product development programs. However, due to the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the U.S. and globally, and its effect on hospital resources, focus and availability of services, and professional staff, our clinical trials and the next expected milestones of our product candidates may be impacted, and we may experience delays in anticipated timelines and milestones. In addition, these timelines are dependent on our ability to secure sufficient capital to continue development without interruption.

Istaroxime
 
Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which patients often experience episodic periods of increased symptoms known as AHF, where the heart fails to adequately pump, resulting in worsening symptoms, including pulmonary and peripheral edema and other severe complications. In the U.S., approximately 6 million people (nearly 2% of the adult population) have heart failure and approximately half of these patients are expected to die within five years of diagnosis; and in the combined U.S., EU and Japan markets, there are more than 18 million patients suffering from heart failure. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients age 65 years and older. AHF can be precipitated by many factors and puts patients at increased risk for morbidity, hospital readmission and mortality. There are more than 1.3 million hospital admissions for heart failure in the U.S. each year and over 2.5 million hospital estimated admissions for AHF in the combined U.S., EU and Japan markets. We estimate that AHF may represent a potential combined addressable market (U.S., EU and Japan) of approximately $1.6 billion annually.
Istaroxime (Early Cardiogenic Shock)
 
We are evaluating istaroxime for the treatment of early cardiogenic shock, a severe presentation of heart failure characterized by very low blood pressure and hypo-perfusion to critical organs which is associated with high mortality and morbidity and is not well treated with current therapies. In September 2020, we initiated a small phase 2 clinical study of istaroxime for the acute treatment of early cardiogenic shock in heart failure patients with a more severe case of heart failure to evaluate the potential to improve blood pressure and organ perfusion. The study also will evaluate the safety and side effect profile of istaroxime in this patient population. We expect data to be available in the second half of 2021. With the current global COVID-19 pandemic, however, and its disruptive effect on hospital resources, including intensive care units, or ICUs, where this study is being conducted, and availability of services and professional staff, we have experienced delays in our site-set-up activities and anticipate that we may have continuing delays that could affect our clinical timelines and milestones.
 
We believe istaroxime may fulfill an unmet need in early cardiogenic shock based on the profile observed in our phase 2 clinical studies in AHF, which demonstrated that istaroxime significantly improved cardiac function and systolic blood pressure. Because of the unmet need in the treatment of early cardiogenic shock, we believe there may be an opportunity with a breakthrough therapy designation to benefit from an expedited development program. Moreover, regulatory precedent exists for an approval in distributive shock settings based upon improvements in blood pressure with an acceptable safety profile. In addition, receipt of either Fast Track or breakthrough therapy designation may increase the likelihood of receiving priority review of a marketing application, which would provide for an expedited review timeframe; however, there is no guarantee that we would receive breakthrough or Fast Track designation or that any such designation will lead to a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures.
 
Istaroxime (AHF)
 
Istaroxime is a first-in-class, dual action investigational drug that we are developing to treat AHF with a potentially differentiated safety profile from current AHF therapies. In 2019, we announced topline results of a successful phase 2b clinical trial of istaroxime in which the primary endpoint of cardiac function, E/Ea ratio (echocardiographic assessment reflecting changes in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or PCWP, or left ventricular filing pressure) as well as other important parameters were significantly improved. Istaroxime has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of AHF. In April 2020, we announced the presentation at the American College of Cardiology 2020 virtual meeting of a new subset analysis from a phase 2b study of istaroxime in patients hospitalized with AHF. This post-hoc analysis characterized the responses between Caucasian and Asian patients and demonstrated that the istaroxime dose of 0.5 µg/kg/min produced a similar response on E/e’, the primary study endpoint, and stroke volume index, an important measure of cardiac performance.
 
Istaroxime represents a novel approach to the treatment of AHF. It has a dual mechanism of action to improve cardiovascular physiology. Current therapy for heart failure in the hospital typically includes intravenous diuretics and, if the blood pressure is low, supportive therapy with inotropes. Inotropes are often associated with adverse effects such as hypotension, arrhythmias and, in some cases, increased mortality. These drugs are used only if needed to support blood pressure and cardiac function. We believe that istaroxime, if approved, may have the potential to address unmet medical needs of these patients by improving cardiac function and management of fluid accumulation that contributes to heart failure symptoms with a potentially differentiated safety profile from current AHF therapies, including a potential reduction in complications and improvement of other clinical outcomes.
 
To advance istaroxime for the treatment of AHF potentially through the phase 2 clinical program and be in a phase 3-ready position, our strategy includes, subject to adequate resources, planning an additional phase 2 clinical trial that will enroll up to 300 patients in approximately 75 clinical sites globally. The trial will focus on enrolling patients with low blood pressure and those who are diuretic resistant, two of the specific patient populations that we believe could particularly benefit from the unique profile and potential ability of istaroxime to increase cardiac function, increase blood pressure and improve renal function. This trial has been designed to collect data on measures that may serve as primary endpoints in a phase 3 clinical trial, and will include an optimized dosing regimen, potentially extending the infusion time beyond 24 hours. We currently do not have sufficient capital to initiate this clinical trial. We are exploring capital from public and private equity offerings and potential strategic opportunities to fund the initiation of this clinical trial, and plan to initiate the clinical trial after obtaining adequate funding. We plan to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on hospital resources and resulting potential changes in regulatory timelines for conducting non-COVID-19-related clinical trials.
 
Rostafuroxin
 
Rostafuroxin is a novel investigational drug product candidate being developed for the treatment of hypertension in patients with a specific genetic profile, which is found in approximately 20% - 25% of the adult hypertensive population. Rostafuroxin has been studied in three phase 2 clinical trials assessing reduction in blood pressure in a hypertensive population selected in accordance with the specified genetic profile. After positive phase 2a results, a phase 2b study was initiated. In this most recent phase 2b clinical trial, rostafuroxin demonstrated efficacy in Caucasian patients but not in Chinese patients.
 
According to the CDC, patients with high blood pressure have a greater risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the U.S. Nearly half of adults in the U.S. (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or are taking medication for hypertension. In 2018, nearly half a million deaths in the U.S. included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. Only about 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control. Patients often have persistent hypertension despite being on multiple therapies. Ethnicity and genetic makeup are known to impact the response to anti-hypertensive treatments, and uncontrolled hypertension has been associated with certain genetic makeups. Given the size of the market and the prevalence of unmet medical needs, major pharmaceutical companies have maintained hypertension as a key area of focus and continue to seek new drugs to compete in markets they have established with previous anti-hypertensive therapies. We are currently engaged in a process to test the industry’s interest in investing in new drugs in this market, and plan to pursue potential licensing transactions and/or other strategic opportunities.

Preclinical Oral, Chronic and Acute Heart Failure Product Candidates
 
We are pursuing several early exploratory research programs to assess potential product candidates, including oral and intravenous SERCA2a activator heart failure compounds, and believe that we can add value to our cardiovascular portfolio by advancing these SERCA2a activator candidates through preclinical studies. To further advance these product candidates, we are actively exploring potential licensing transactions, research partnership arrangements or other strategic opportunities.
Lyophilized KL4 Surfactant (COVID-19 related Lung Injury)
 
Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may progress to severe respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. This acute lung injury, known as ARDS, has no approved therapies and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare resource utilization. The COVID-19 virus infects via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, or ACE2, on cells in the lung which impair surfactant production, resulting in decreased lung compliance, and increased likelihood of needing mechanical ventilation. We believe this mechanism of injury may differentiate COVID-19 lung injury from other etiologies of ARDS and is the basis for a potentially important role for our KL4 surfactant. Lung fibrosis and severe interstitial changes occurring in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in premature infants who are initially ventilated due to RDS and later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, a condition in which KL4 surfactant clinical data suggests a potential benefit. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence shows surfactant replacement therapy has the potential to improve lung function, oxygenation, lung compliance and decrease pulmonary inflammation. These beneficial effects could lead to potential clinical improvements such as decreased need for mechanical ventilation, decreased time on ventilator (freeing the devices for other patients) and possibly mortality.
 
In September 2020, the FDA accepted our IND application for a phase 2 clinical trial to assess the impact of our lyophilized KL4 surfactant on key respiratory parameters in ventilated COVID-19 patients. This small pilot study is designed to evaluate changes in physiological parameters in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated for COVID-19 associated lung injury and ARDS. The study will evaluate the dosing regimen, tolerability, and functional changes in gas exchange and lung compliance after KL4 surfactant administration. We dosed the first patient in this clinical trial in January 2021 and plan to enroll up to 20 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who are on mechanical ventilation, from four to five U.S. sites, with data expected in mid-2021.
 
If the initial trial results are favorable and we are able to secure the required additional funding, we plan to engage with the FDA to define a development pathway forward and may initiate an expanded clinical trial in ventilated patients to establish a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes that could be the basis for regulatory approval. In addition, if the results warrant, we may consider expanding our development efforts to study ARDS caused by other viral pneumonias.
 
We are funding the initial COVID-19 study using available resources. If the results of the initial study are positive, we plan to pursue multiple non-dilutive funding sources to secure the additional capital that may be needed to initiate and complete any follow-on development activities, including, to the extent available, grants and other funding commitments from U.S. government agencies, and private foundations, as well as pursuant to co-development and co-marketing agreements, and similar arrangements. In early 2020, we approached the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and requested funding for our development plans for KL4 surfactant in COVID-19 patients and we were granted a meeting to review our proposal with BARDA representatives. With the acceptance of the IND by the FDA and initiation of the clinical trial, we plan to reengage with BARDA and potentially other federal government agencies and private foundations to seek funding for this program. There can be no assurance that we will receive any funding from BARDA or any other governmental agency or foundation. If we are successful, we also may pursue one or more licensing transactions, collaboration arrangements or other strategic opportunities to support the further development of lyophilized KL4 surfactant in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S.
 
AEROSURF (lucinactant for inhalation)
 
AEROSURF is an investigational combination drug/medical device product that we are developing to improve the management of RDS in premature infants. RDS is a condition that occurs in premature infants who may not have fully developed natural lung surfactant, which is essential to normal respiratory function and survival, and may require surfactant therapy to sustain life, and can result in long-term respiratory problems, developmental delays and death. Surfactant therapy is the primary therapy to address an underlying surfactant deficiency, and AEROSURF is designed to deliver aerosolized KL4 surfactant noninvasively using our proprietary ADS technology. We have completed three AEROSURF phase 2 clinical trials. Our most recent phase 2b clinical trial did not achieve its primary endpoint, due primarily, we believe, to an unexpected rate of treatment interruptions associated with the prototype phase 2 ADS used in the phase 2b clinical trial, or phase 2 ADS. After excluding patients whose doses were interrupted, in accordance with the predesignated statistical plan, we observed a meaningful treatment effect in line with our desired targeted outcome and believe that these results support the further development of AEROSURF to reduce both the rate of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or nCPAP, failure and the need for intubation in premature infants being treated for RDS. In addition, a pooled post-hoc analysis of data from two phase 2 studies suggests that AEROSURF treatment at the higher doses may have the potential to lower the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, a chronic lung disease of premature infants who have required intubation, mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. AEROSURF has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of RDS.
 
RDS is the most prevalent respiratory disease in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. Surfactants currently available in the U.S. are generally administered using invasive endotracheal intubation, frequently with mechanical ventilation, procedures that may result in serious respiratory conditions and other complications. AEROSURF is designed to deliver aerosolized KL4 surfactant noninvasively using our proprietary ADS technology and potentially may meaningfully reduce the use of invasive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. We believe that AEROSURF, if approved, may meaningfully reduce the number of premature infants who are subjected to invasive surfactant administration, and potentially provide transformative clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits. In addition, we believe that AEROSURF may support an expansion of the RDS market by reducing the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, reducing hospital costs, and enabling dosing and repeat dosing as needed using AEROSURF noninvasive delivery of KL4 surfactant via nCPAP. Moreover, while the current surfactant market represents drug-only revenues, we believe we can capture revenues from both the drug product and the ADS disposable cartridges, supported by anticipated pharmacoeconomic benefits associated with the successful use of nCPAP. We believe that AEROSURF, if approved, may be administered in less specialized hospitals and birthing centers, potentially further expanding access to treatment. We also believe that AEROSURF has the potential to achieve a higher price per patient in an addressable global market that could be in excess of $1.2 billion annually.
 
We successfully completed design verification activities for a newly designed ADS, referred to as the new ADS, for use in our remaining development activities, including potentially a phase 3 program. The new ADS combines the same aerosolization technology used during the phase 2 clinical program, but with improved ergonomics, interface, controls, and dose monitoring in a modular design. The new ADS also implements design changes to potentially mitigate the risks of device-related treatment interruptions experienced in the phase 2 ADS used in the phase 2b clinical trial, and we believe it will be easier and faster to use and may support enhanced clinical outcomes by potentially allowing for reduced time to initial administration of our KL4 surfactant and reduced time intervals between doses compared to our phase 2 prototype.

In April 2020, as part of the phase 2 clinical program and to prepare to transition to a phase 3 clinical program, we enrolled the first patient and commenced a small, approximately 90-patient, phase 2b bridging study in premature infants with RDS that was designed to clinically evaluate the performance of our new ADS, provide for clinical experience in the NICU, and implement a more intensive dosing regimen, with additional higher dose treatment data to augment data previously obtained in the earlier phase 2b clinical trial. This trial was designed as a multicenter, randomized, controlled study with masked treatment assignment in up to 90 premature infants 26 to 32 week gestational age receiving nasal continuous airway pressure, or nCPAP, for RDS. The trial was designed to leverage the favorable safety profile of the two previous AEROSURF phase 2 clinical trials and evaluate higher and more frequent dosing of aerosolized KL4 surfactant compared to premature infants receiving standard care of nCPAP alone. The trial utilized the new ADS and was designed to bridge to data generated in the earlier phase 2 programs that utilized a phase 2 ADS on the following endpoints: time to nCPAP failure (the need for intubation and delayed surfactant therapy), incidence of nCPAP failure and physiological parameters indicating the effectiveness of lung function. 
 
In August 2020, we entered into a Project Financing Agreement with Lee’s (HK), or the PF Agreement, dated and effective as of August 12, 2020, under which we received payments totaling $2.8 million through October 2020. Pursuant to the PF Agreement, Lee’s (HK) agreed to pay additional amounts to be set forth in an updated development budget to be agreed between the parties by September 1, 2020 and updated every six months thereafter, to fund the continued development of AEROSURF and to be paid with the payment schedule to be set forth in each updated development budget. In partial satisfaction of our obligations under the PF Agreement, we agreed to pay Lee’s (HK) 50% of any Commercialization Net Revenues (as defined in the PF Agreement) up to an amount that is equal to 125% of the Project Expenses (as defined in the PF Agreement) funded by Lee’s (HK). On November 12, 2020, Lee’s (HK) provided notice of termination of additional funding under the PF Agreement. Thereafter, we and Lee’s (HK) revised our plans for the continued development of AEROSURF. Lee’s (HK) agreed to continue the development of AEROSURF in Asia at its cost. Lee’s (HK) will fund an additional $1.0 million to us in 2021 for certain transition and analytical services to be provided by us with respect to the development of AEROSURF, which will be considered “Project Expenses” under the terms of the PF Agreement.
 
In 2021, we plan to continue supporting Lee’s (HK) efforts to plan, fund and initiate in Asia the phase 2b bridging study needed to advance AEROSURF to phase 3 clinical trials. With termination of the PF Agreement, we ceased enrollment in our phase 2b bridging study at the EU clinical sites and are preparing to transfer AEROSURF development activities to Lee’s (HK) to be implemented under the terms of our Asia License Agreement. Our decision to cease enrollment and transfer the AEROSURF development activities to Lee’s (HK) in Asia was not related to any communications between ourselves and the FDA or the EU regulatory authorities and was not based on any underlying safety or efficacy concern, but rather compelled by our desire to preserve our limited capital to focus on acute cardiovascular and other KL4 surfactant programs, primarily treatment of lung injury in patients with COVID-19.
 
We also plan to pursue one or more licensing transactions, collaboration arrangements or other strategic opportunities to support the development of AEROSURF and our lyophilized KL4 surfactant in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S.
 
Lyophilized KL4 Surfactant (Lung Injury and Other Studies)
 
We believe our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and ADS technologies may potentially support a product pipeline to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. We have from time to time worked with independent investigators and pharmaceutical companies to conduct or assist with preclinical studies, some of which were funded under grants from National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and other government agencies, to assess the utility of using our KL4 surfactant, alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical compounds, to address various respiratory conditions.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to closely monitor its impact on our business, operations, including its potential impact on our clinical development plans and timelines, and financial condition. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our operations, capital and financial resources and overall liquidity position and outlook have been impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to delays experienced in our operations, including in clinical study initiation and enrollment. The potentially extended timelines may force us to expend more of our capital resources than planned to achieve our projected milestones. For example, certain of our ongoing clinical trials, including our phase 2 study of istaroxime for early cardiogenic shock in heart failure patients, have experienced delays. The full extent, duration, or impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have, directly or indirectly, on our financial condition and operations, including ongoing and planned clinical trials, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These potential future developments include new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the severity and transmissibility of new variants of the virus, such as the B.1.1.7 strain first identified in the United Kingdom and the B.1.351 strain first detected in South Africa, cases of which have been confirmed in the U.S., information about any regional resurgences in one or more markets where our current or intended clinical trial sites, our principal executive offices, research and development laboratories or other facilities are located, and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, which may include, among others, the timing and extent of governments reopening activities and the economic impact on local, regional, national, and international markets. The strategic re-implementation of mitigating COVID-19 measures in one or more markets where our clinical trial sites, principal executive offices, research and development laboratories or other facilities are located remains possible and we believe there could be further impact on the clinical development of our product candidates, which may include potential delays, halts or modifications to our ongoing and planned trials in 2021.

To fund any further development activities, we plan to pursue non-dilutive funding opportunities, including potentially grants and other funding commitments from U.S. government agencies, if available, and other potential strategic opportunities, including licensing transactions, collaboration arrangements or other similar transactions in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S.;

Our Product Candidates
 
Istaroxime
 
Our lead cardiovascular product is istaroxime, a novel, first-in-class, dual action investigational drug that we are developing to treat AHF and early cardiogenic shock. Istaroxime has been evaluated in two phase 2 clinical trials, the results of which suggest that istaroxime may improve cardiovascular physiological function as assessed by parameters of pump function, decreases in heart rate, increases in blood pressure and renal function (as measured by filtration rate) without adverse events such as arrhythmias or cardiac damage (as indicated by elevated troponin values). In August 2019, the FDA granted us Fast Track designation for istaroxime for the treatment of AHF.
AHF and Early Cardiogenic Shock Overview
 
Heart failure can result from structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Heart failure is a chronic, progressive disease that commonly but episodically worsens to a point of critical decompensation, where cardiac output fails to meet the body’s metabolic needs. The disease is characterized by inadequate pumping function of the heart that results in fluid accumulation manifesting as pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema and congestion in other parts of the body. Insufficient cardiac output can result in inadequate peripheral perfusion that increases the risk of other organ dysfunction such as renal failure. Chronic heart failure is commonly treated with multiple medications including diuretics, inhibitors of neurohumoral imbalances (angiotensin, renin, aldosterone, naturetic peptides) and beta blockers. Effective treatments for AHF in a hospital setting are lacking.
 
Clinical objectives for AHF patient management include: (i) relieve pulmonary congestion and general edema with intravenous diuretics, (ii) improve cardiac function and peripheral / organ perfusion, (iii) achieve a stable, fully compensated clinical state and, (iv) transition to oral, outpatient medicines (for chronic management of their heart failure). 
 
Current approaches to acutely improve cardiac function are associated with unwanted effects including heart rhythm disturbances, increased heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, decreased blood pressure, potential damage to the heart muscle, worsening renal function and even increases in mortality have been observed. In particular, patients with low systolic blood pressure, or SBP, and peripheral hypoperfusion are high risk, challenging patients and are also generally resistant to diuretic therapy and often discharged in a sub-optimal state.
 
Early cardiogenic shock is a severe presentation of heart failure characterized by very low blood pressure and hypo-perfusion to critical organs. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity and is not well treated with current therapies.

Method of Action
 
Istaroxime represents a novel approach to the treatment of AHF. It has a dual mechanism of action to improve cardiovascular physiology. First, it activates the SERCA2a calcium pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or SR, leading to enhanced SR calcium uptake and a reduction in cytoplasmic calcium that is thought to improve myocardial relaxation. Second, it inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase activity leading to improved myocardial contractility.
 
 

We believe that these mechanisms of action may result in improvement in cardiac function and perfusion to reduce congestion and edema and preserve other organ function while avoiding the side effects associated with other classes of heart failure therapies. Data from preclinical, phase 2a and phase 2b clinical studies performed to date suggest that istaroxime may improve cardiovascular physiology as assessed by parameters of pump function, decreases in PCWP, decreases in heart rate, increases in blood pressure without an increase in adverse events such as arrhythmias, cardiac damage (as indicated by elevated troponin values) or adverse impact on kidney function. We believe that these features of istaroxime, if approved, could potentially result in clinical improvement of patients' heart failure symptoms, reduce complications and improve other clinical outcomes when compared to current therapeutic regimens for AHF.
 
Clinical Development
 
Early Cardiogenic Shock
 
After assessing the regulatory landscape and data from the istaroxime phase 2 clinical program in AHF and discussions with our scientific advisors, we added to our istaroxime development program a study in early cardiogenic shock. We believe that istaroxime may fulfill an unmet medical need in early cardiogenic shock based on the profile observed in prior phase 2 clinical studies in AHF, in which istaroxime increased SBP, suggesting that istaroxime could potentially contribute to the clinical improvement of select patients in cardiogenic shock due to heart failure. In addition, we believe there may be opportunities for an expedited regulatory pathway and review in early cardiogenic shock. Based on precedent, we believe that approval for early cardiogenic shock potentially could be based on blood pressure changes alone (assuming comparable mortality compared to control patients at 30 days).
 
In the second half of 2020, we initiated a small study of istaroxime for the acute treatment of early cardiogenic shock in patients with more severe cases of heart failure, to evaluate the potential to improve blood pressure and organ perfusion. This study is a phase 2 international randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of istaroxime in patients with early cardiogenic shock due to heart failure. This study will include 60 patients (30 assigned to istaroxime and 30 assigned to placebo) receiving study drug infusion over 24 hours. The primary endpoint is the change in systolic blood pressure over six hours after initiating the infusion. Secondary endpoints will include characterization of blood pressure changes over 24 hours, the number of patients requiring rescue therapy (vasopressors, inotropes or mechanical devices), assessment of renal function and measures associated with safety and tolerability. The study will also evaluate the safety and side effect profile of istaroxime in this patient population. We expect data to be available in the second half of 2021. With the current global COVID-19 pandemic, however, and its disruptive effect on hospital resources, including ICUs where this study is being conducted, and availability of services and professional staff, we have experienced delays in our site-set-up activities and anticipate that we may have continuing delays that could affect our clinical timelines and milestones.
 
    AHF
 
Istaroxime has been evaluated in six clinical trials assessing three doses in 280 patients, including two phase 2 clinical trials. In a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical trial, three doses of istaroxime were evaluated in a study of 120 hospitalized patients (approximately 30 patients per cohort) with AHF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with three doses of istaroxime administered over a 6-hour infusion period. In this clinical trial, the primary endpoint of lowering of PCWP was significantly improved in all three doses relative to placebo, and the certain secondary hemodynamic endpoints (increased systolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate) also improved. The main side effects were vomiting (7.9%) and pain at the infusion site (5.6%); one severe adverse event of ventricular tachycardia was observed. The favorable effects on PCWP, blood pressure and heart rate provided the basis for moving the program forward into a phase clinical 2b trial and for selecting the doses to study.
 
The primary endpoint of the istaroxime phase 2b clinical trial for AHF was a change from baseline to 24 hours after start of infusion (Day 1) in E/e’ with istaroxime 0.5 or 1.0 gg/kg/min compared to placebo. The E/e’ ratio is a marker of the function of the left ventricle, or LV, of the heart and was measured using doppler echocardiography read by a central laboratory. Secondary endpoints included change in other parameters of cardiac function, such as diastolic function, or E/A, stroke volume, or SVI, left ventricle ejection fraction, or LVEF, LV volumes, left atrial, or LA, area, interior vena cava, or IVC, diameter. A 24-hour infusion of istaroxime was associated with significant improvements in cardiac function, in both dosing groups, with a mean E/e' of -4.55 for the 0.5 gg/kg/min group and -3.16 for the 1.0 gg/kg/min group, compared with mean placebo E/e’ ratios of -1.55 and -1.08, respectively. Twenty-four-hour infusions of istaroxime were also associated with substantial increases in stroke volume in both dosing groups, with a mean SVI value of 5.33 ml/beat/m2 for the 0.5 gg/kg/min group and 5.49 ml/beat/m2 for the 1.0 gg/kg/min group, compared with the mean placebo SVI of 1.65 ml/beat/m2 and 3.18 ml/beat/m2, respectively. Importantly, subjects also maintained or increased SBP, with a mean change in SBP of 2.82 mmHg for the 0.5 gg/kg/min group and 6.1 mmHg for the 1.0 gg/kg/min group, compared with the mean placebo SBP values of -2.47 mmHg and 2.7 mmHg, respectively. There were no signs of increased risk for arrhythmias or increased troponin levels (a marker of heart muscle damage) during or after istaroxime infusion. Additionally, blood pressure tended to increase, and heart rate decreased, during the infusion with istaroxime, which may have contributed to the short-term trend toward improvement in renal function. The findings were consistent with the physiologic improvements seen in the phase 2a study and the effects of istaroxime in AHF.

Istaroxime was generally well tolerated. Istaroxime did not appear to be associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias or increases in cardiac troponin T. The rate of cardiovascular-related adverse events was 23% for placebo, 10% for istaroxime low dose, and 18% for istaroxime high dose, with cardiac failure occurring in 3%, 5% and 8% of placebo, low dose and high dose patients, respectively. The cases of cardiac failure were reported by the investigator as “worsening of heart failure” symptoms that occurred approximately 10-14 days after study drug administration and were not considered to be drug related. The most common adverse drug reactions reported included pain at infusion site, generally associated with use of short catheters, and dose-related gastrointestinal adverse events in 5%, 10% and 38% of placebo, low dose and high dose patients, respectively. Serious adverse events included one cardiac death and one case of cardiogenic shock (in the same patient who died) in the istaroxime 1.0 mg group, two cases of cardiac failure in the 0.5 mg group, three cases of cardiac failure in the 1.0 mg group, and one case of renal embolism in the 1.0 mg group. There was an additional cardiac death outside the 30-day window.
 
Based on feedback from the FDA in June 2019 and discussions with our scientific advisors, to advance istaroxime for the treatment of AHF potentially through the phase 2 clinical program and be in a phase 3-ready position, our strategy includes, subject to adequate resources, planning an additional phase 2 clinical trial that will enroll up to 300 patients in approximately 75 clinical sites globally. This trial will focus on treating heart failure patients with low systolic blood pressure and those who are diuretic resistant and should serve as an enrichment strategy to target those patients most likely to respond well to istaroxime administration. These two, difficult-to-treat patient groups have limited treatment options and could particularly benefit from the istaroxime unique profile and potential ability to increase cardiac function, increase blood pressure and improve renal function. The trial will also collect data on measures that may serve as primary endpoints in a phase 3 clinical trial, and will include an optimized dosing regimen, potentially extending the infusion time beyond 24 hours. We currently do not have sufficient capital to initiate this clinical trial. We are exploring capital from public and private equity offerings and potential strategic opportunities to fund the initiation of this clinical trial, and plan to initiate the clinical trial after obtaining adequate funding.

Rostafuroxin
 
Rostafuroxin is a novel investigational drug product candidate being developed for the treatment of hypertension in patients with a specific genetic profile, which is found in approximately 20% - 25% of the adult hypertensive population.
Hypertension Overview
 
According to the CDC, patients with high blood pressure have a greater risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the U.S. Nearly half of adults in the U.S. (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or are taking medication for hypertension. In 2018, nearly half a million deaths in the U.S. included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. Only about 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control. Patients often have persistent hypertension despite being on multiple therapies. Ethnicity and genetic makeup are known to impact the response to anti-hypertensive treatments, and uncontrolled hypertension has been associated with certain genetic makeups. Given the size of the market and the prevalence of unmet medical needs, major pharmaceutical companies have maintained hypertension as a key area of focus and continue to seek new drugs to compete in markets they have established with previous anti-hypertensive therapies. We are currently engaged in a process to test the industry’s interest in investing in new drugs in this market, and plan to pursue potential licensing transactions and/or other strategic opportunities with a company that has interest in and/or operates in the anti-hypertension market.
Method of Action
 
Rostafuroxin is designed to be a selective antagonist of adducin polymorphisms and endogenous ouabain, both known triggers of hypertension, and creates functional effects by enhancing renal tubular sodium reabsorption and increasing vascular tone.
Clinical Development
 
Rostafuroxin has been studied in three phase 2 clinical trials assessing reduction in blood pressure in a hypertensive population selected in accordance with a specified genetic profile. A phase 2b clinical trial was conducted as a two-part study with the first part conducted in Italy with Caucasian patients and the second part conducted in Taiwan with ethnic Chinese patients. The efficacy results in Italy were positive in both this trial and in an earlier phase 2a clinical trial; however, the blood pressure response in Chinese patients in the second part of the phase 2b study was minimal.

Preclinical Heart Failure Product Candidates
 
We are pursuing early exploratory research to assess our preclinical follow-on oral and intravenous SERCA2a activator heart failure compounds. To advance these product candidates, we are actively exploring potential licensing transactions, research partnership arrangements or other strategic opportunities.
Lyophilized KL4 Surfactant
 
We believe our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and ADS technologies may potentially support a product pipeline to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. One such program is our ongoing study to assess the utility of using KL4 surfactant to address COVID-19 pneumonia.
COVID-19 related Lung Injury Overview
 
Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may progress to ARDS and require supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. ARDS has no approved therapies and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare resource utilization. The COVID-19 virus infects via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, or ACE2, on cells in the lung which impair surfactant production, resulting in decreased lung compliance, and increased likelihood of needing mechanical ventilation. We believe this mechanism of injury may differentiate COVID-19 lung injury from other etiologies of ARDS and is the basis for a potentially important role for our KL4 surfactant. Lung fibrosis and severe interstitial changes occurring in these COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in premature infants who are initially ventilated due to RDS and later develop BPD – a condition in which KL4 surfactant clinical data suggests a potential benefit. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence shows surfactant replacement therapy has the potential to improve lung function, oxygenation, lung compliance and decrease pulmonary inflammation. These beneficial effects could lead to potential clinical improvements such as decreased need for mechanical ventilation, decreased time on ventilator (freeing the devices for other patients) and possibly mortality.
 
RDS Overview
 
Our KL4 surfactant can be lyophilized (freeze-dried) and reconstituted to a liquid just prior to administration. We have in the past considered potential development pathways to secure marketing approval for lyophilized KL4 surfactant as an intratracheal instillate for the treatment and/or prevention of RDS in premature infants who, because they are unable to breathe on their own or other reason, are not candidates for AEROSURF. Lyophilized KL4 surfactant is the drug product component of AEROSURF and a lyophilized (freeze-dried) dosage form of the liquid KL4 surfactant intratracheal instillate, SURFAXIN®, that was approved by the FDA in 2012, but the SURFAXIN drug product was withdrawn from the market by us voluntarily in 2015 to focus our resources on the development of aerosolized KL4 surfactant for respiratory diseases, beginning with AEROSURF. We have demonstrated in laboratory experiments that our lyophilized KL4 surfactant retains many of the key attributes and characteristics of SURFAXIN. In September 2019, we discussed with the FDA a potential clinical trial design to open an IND for lyophilized KL4 surfactant and, if we decide to move forward, expect to re-engage with the FDA to confirm a development plan, trial design and regulatory plan to gain approval for lyophilized KL4 surfactant in the U.S. We expect that Lee’s (HK) will continue to pursue approval of lyophilized KL4 surfactant in Asia pursuant to the Asia License Agreement.
 
Clinical Development
 
COVID-19 related Lung Injury
 
In September 2020, the FDA accepted our IND application for a phase 2 clinical trial to assess the impact of our lyophilized KL4 surfactant on key respiratory parameters in ventilated COVID-19 patients. This small pilot study is designed to evaluate changes in physiological parameters in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated for COVID-19 associated lung injury and ARDS. The study will evaluate the dosing regimen, tolerability, and functional changes in gas exchange and lung compliance after KL4 surfactant administration. We dosed the first patient in this clinical trial in January 2021 and plan to enroll up to 20 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who are on mechanical ventilation, from four to five U.S. sites, with data expected in mid-2021.
 
If the initial results are favorable and we are able to secure the required additional funding, we plan to engage with the FDA to define a development pathway forward and may initiate an expanded clinical trial in ventilated patients to establish a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes that could be the basis for regulatory approval. In addition, if the results warrant, we may consider expanding our development efforts to study ARDS caused by other viral pneumonias.
 
Lung Injury and Other Studies
 
We believe our lyophilized KL4 surfactant and ADS technologies may potentially support a product pipeline to address a broad range of serious respiratory conditions in children and adults. KL4 surfactant has been widely studied across 17 clinical studies in approximately 2,500 patients with various related acute pulmonary syndromes. We have previously announced results of a NIH-funded study of aerosolized KL4 surfactant demonstrating reduced lung inflammation and improved overall survival in a well-established animal model of a highly pathogenic avian influenza. We have received support in the past, and in the future may seek additional support, from the NIH and other government funding sources to explore the utility of our KL4 surfactant to address a variety of respiratory conditions such as acute lung injury, or ALI, including acute radiation exposure to the lung (acute pneumonitis and delayed lung injury), chemical-induced ALI, and influenza-induced ALI; as well as chronic rhinosinusitis, complications of certain major surgeries, mechanical ventilator-induced lung injury, often referred to as VILI, pneumonia, and diseases involving mucociliary clearance disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, or CF. We have also worked with pharmaceutical companies to explore the feasibility of combining our KL4 surfactant with other therapies.
AEROSURF
 
Overview
 
AEROSURF® (lucinactant for inhalation) is an investigational drug/medical device combination product that we are developing to improve the management of RDS in premature infants who may not have fully developed natural lung surfactant and may require surfactant therapy to sustain life. AEROSURF is designed to deliver aerosolized KL4 surfactant noninvasively using our proprietary ADS technology and potentially may meaningfully reduce the use of invasive endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. We believe that AEROSURF, if approved, may meaningfully reduce the number of premature infants who are subjected to invasive surfactant administration, and potentially provide transformative clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for AEROSURF to treat RDS.

RDS and BPD Overview
 
RDS is the most prevalent respiratory disease in the NICU. Surfactant therapy can be a life-saving treatment for RDS and is the primary therapy to address an underlying surfactant deficiency. Unfortunately, surfactants currently available in the U.S. are animal-derived and are generally administered using invasive procedures, including endotracheal intubation, frequently with mechanical ventilation. We believe that this market has been constrained because the invasive procedures required to administer surfactants may result in serious respiratory conditions and other complications. We also believe that AEROSURF may support an expansion of the RDS surfactant market by reducing the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, reducing hospital costs, and enabling dosing and repeat dosing as needed using noninvasive delivery of AEROSURF via nCPAP. Moreover, while the current surfactant market represents drug-only revenues, we believe we can capture revenues from both the drug product and the ADS disposable cartridges, supported by anticipated pharmacoeconomic benefits associated with the successful use of nCPAP. We believe that AEROSURF, if approved, may be administered in less specialized hospitals and birthing centers, potentially further expanding access to treatment and potentially achieving a higher price per patient in an addressable global market that could be in excess of $1.2 billion annually.
 
We also believe that AEROSURF may fulfill an unmet medical need in the treatment of BPD, a chronic lung disease of premature infants who have required intubation, mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. BPD is associated with ongoing pulmonary disease and neurodevelopmental impairment that contributes to substantial patient morbidity. This is associated with increased health care utilization and higher healthcare costs. Notwithstanding, effective prevention and treatment strategies for BPD have been elusive and there is no approved treatment.
 
Clinical Development
 
We have evaluated AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants in three phase 2 clinical trials. We believe the results support further exploration of a potentially beneficial treatment effect when the treatment is delivered as intended.
 
In two phase 2a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled studies in premature infants 26 to 32 week gestational age receiving nCPAP, AEROSURF was generally well-tolerated. Efficacy was an exploratory endpoint in both trials. There was evidence of a beneficial treatment effect in one study of premature infants 29 to 32 week gestational age. In the other study of premature infants 26 to 28 week gestational age, there was no difference in rate of nCPAP failure, but the assessment was complicated by the occurrence of unanticipated treatment interruptions which may have obscured a potential efficacy signal.
 
In 2017 we completed a phase 2b clinical trial evaluating AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants. The clinical trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled study with masked treatment assignment in 221 premature infants that was designed to evaluate aerosolized KL4 surfactant administered to premature infants 26 to 32 week gestational age receiving nCPAP, in two dose groups (25 and 50 minutes) with up to two potential repeat doses, compared to infants receiving nCPAP alone. This trial was conducted in approximately 50 clinical sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America. In this clinical trial, AEROSURF did not meet the primary endpoint of a reduction in nCPAP failure at 72 hours. We believe this result was attributable in large part to an unexpected rate of treatment interruptions, which occurred in about 23% of active enrollments, predominantly in the 50-minute dose group. These interruptions, we believe, were primarily related to specific lots of disposable cartridge filters in the ADS that had a greater tendency to clog. After excluding patients in the 50-minute dose group whose dose was interrupted, in accordance with the predesignated statistical plan, nCPAP failure rates were 44% in the control group (n=71) compared to 32% (n=44) in the AEROSURF 50-minute dose group, which is a 12% absolute reduction or a 27% relative reduction in nCPAP failure compared to control. These data suggest a meaningful treatment effect in line with our desired targeted outcome. The overall data suggest that the safety and tolerability profile of AEROSURF was generally comparable to the control group. Reported adverse events and serious adverse events were those that are common and expected among premature infants with RDS and comparable to the control group. As expected, some peridosing events occurred (i.e., changes in oxygen requirements and blood pressure in the time around dosing) more commonly in the AEROSURF groups, however, these were transient in nature and occurred less frequently than seen in intratracheal administration.
 
In the post hoc pooled analysis of the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial and phase 2a clinical trial in infants 26 to 28 weeks gestational age, AEROSURF treatment at the higher doses was associated with significantly lowered incidence and severity of BPD compared to infants on nCPAP alone. This effect was observed without excluding patients whose treatment was interrupted.
 
In 2018, we transitioned from the phase 2 ADS, to the new ADS for use in our remaining development activities, including potentially a phase 3 clinical program. The new ADS combines the same aerosolization technology used during the phase 2 clinical program, but with improved ergonomics, interface, controls, and dose monitoring in a modular design. We successfully concluded design verification activities through a detailed assessment of the new ADS design and also implemented design changes to potentially mitigate the risks of device-related treatment interruptions experienced in the phase 2 ADS. We conducted extensive performance testing in which the ADS demonstrated consistent performance under rigorous testing and design verification protocols. We believe that the new ADS, which we planned to use in our phase 3 clinical program, will be easier and faster to use and may support enhanced clinical outcomes by potentially allowing for reduced time to initial administration of our KL4 surfactant and reduced time intervals between doses, if required.
 
In April 2020, as part of the phase 2 clinical program and to prepare to transition to a phase 3 clinical program, we enrolled the first patient and commenced a small, approximately 90-patient, phase 2b bridging study in premature infants with RDS that was designed to clinically evaluate the performance of our new ADS, provide for clinical experience in the NICU, and implement a more intensive dosing regimen, with additional higher dose treatment data to augment data previously obtained in the earlier phase 2b clinical trial. This trial, which was to be funded by Lee’s (HK), was designed as a multicenter, randomized, controlled study with masked treatment assignment in up to 90 premature infants 26 to 32 weeks gestational age receiving nCPAP for RDS. The trial was designed to leverage the favorable safety profile of the two previous AEROSURF phase 2 clinical trials and evaluate higher and more frequent dosing of aerosolized KL4 surfactant compared to premature infants receiving standard care of nCPAP alone. The trial utilized the new ADS and was designed to bridge to data generated in the earlier phase 2 programs that utilized a phase 2 ADS on the following endpoints: time to nCPAP failure (the need for intubation and delayed surfactant therapy), incidence of nCPAP failure and physiological parameters indicating the effectiveness of lung function.

On March 18, 2020, we entered into the Term Sheet with Lee’s (HK) pursuant to which Lee’s (HK) agreed to provide financing to fund the development of AEROSURF for the period April 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020 and make payments of up to $3.9 million (which was reduced to $2.8 million under specified circumstances) prior to September 1, 2020. In August 2020, we entered into the PF Agreement with Lee’s (HK), formalizing the terms of the Term Sheet, and under which we received payments totaling $2.8 million through October 2020. Under the PF Agreement, Lee’s (HK) agreed to make certain payments to support the continued development of AEROSURF in amounts set forth in an updated development budget and payment schedule to be finalized no later than September 1, 2020, and thereafter updated every six months. In partial satisfaction of our obligations under the PF Agreement, we agreed to pay Lee’s (HK) 50% of any Commercialization Net Revenues (as defined in the PF Agreement) up to an amount that is equal to 125% of the Project Expenses (as defined in the PF Agreement) funded by Lee’s (HK). On November 12, 2020, Lee’s (HK) provided notice of termination of the PF Agreement. Thereafter, we and Lee’s (HK) revised our plans for the continued development of AEROSURF. Lee’s (HK) agreed to continue the clinical development of AEROSURF in Asia at its cost. Lee’s (HK) will fund an additional $1.0 million to us in 2021, repayable pursuant to the terms of the PF Agreement, for certain transition and analytical services to be provided by us with respect to the development of AEROSURF, which will be considered “Project Expenses” under the terms of the PF Agreement.
 
In 2021, we plan to continue supporting Lee’s (HK) efforts to plan, fund and initiate in Asia the phase 2b bridging study needed to advance AEROSURF to phase 3 clinical trials. With termination of the PF Agreement, we ceased enrollment in our phase 2b bridging study at the EU clinical sites and are preparing to transfer AEROSURF development activities to Lee’s (HK) to be implemented under the terms of our Asia License Agreement. Our decision to cease enrollment and to transfer the AEROSURF development activities to Lee’s (HK) in Asia was not related to any communications between ourselves and the FDA or the EU regulatory authorities and was not based on any underlying safety or efficacy concern, but rather compelled by our desire to preserve our limited capital to focus on acute cardiovascular and other KL4 surfactant programs, primarily treatment of lung injury in patients with COVID-19.
 
We also plan to pursue one or more licensing transactions, collaboration arrangements or other strategic opportunities to support the development of AEROSURF and our lyophilized KL4 surfactant in markets outside of Asia, including the U.S.
 
Manufacturing
 
KL4 surfactant is comprised of four APIs. Our API suppliers are PolyPeptide Group, or PolyPeptide, Corden Pharma and Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. We have supply agreements for the POPG API, and source the other three APIs, including KL4, under purchase orders. Bachem Americas, Inc., or Bachem Americas, was our supplier of KL4 from 2008 through 2020. In June 2019, we received a notice of nonrenewal from them indicating that they were discontinuing the current manufacturing process but agreed to continue manufacturing for us through 2020. That Agreement is now expired. PolyPeptide previously manufactured KL4 for us from approximately 2002 to 2007 and participated in manufacturing development of the current manufacturing process. They have agreed to support our activities in the future.
 
Our lyophilized KL4 surfactant is manufactured for us by Pharma Services Group, Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, or Patheon. We have discussed with Patheon the wind-down of our Master Services Agreement dated as of October 24, 2013 for the manufacture of lyophilized KL4 surfactant, when needed. Patheon has indicated that it will continue to manufacture lyophilized KL4 surfactant to support our planned clinical requirements and will assist us with the technology transfer to another contract manufacturing organization if required. As we plan our pathway forward, we have identified potential contract manufacturers that we believe have appropriate experience to support this program and to which we could issue requests for proposal covering the technology transfer and future manufacturing of lyophilized KL4 surfactant.
 
In our Warrington, Pennsylvania laboratory, we conduct certain analytical and quality control activities including release testing of all API’s and release and stability testing of our lyophilized and aerosolized KL4 surfactant drug product. We also work with a number of third-party institutions and laboratories that perform various studies as well as quality control release and stability testing.
 
We contracted with Clinical Supplies Management, Inc. for the receipt, labeling, packaging and distribution of drug and materials to support the AEROSURF phase 2b bridging study (now suspended).
 
With respect to our ADS, in the second quarter of 2021, we expect to complete a technology transfer of our device manufacturing process from Battelle Memorial Institute, or Battelle, to Mack Molding Company, or Mack, an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer that is capable of producing new ADS devices to support, if applicable, the remaining clinical development in Asia for AEROSURF, including the AEROSURF phase 2b bridging study, and, if applicable, the potential phase 3 clinical program and potential ex-Asia licensing and other strategic transactions. We expect that, if approved, the new ADS will also support our commercial market platform. We currently have a Memorandum of Understanding with Mack to cover this transfer.

Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca Collaboration Agreement
 
In April 2015, our subsidiary, CVie Therapeutics Ltd., or CVie Therapeutics, entered into an Agreement for Scientific Collaboration, or the 2015 Agreement, with the Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, or Bicocca, in Milan, Italy, focused on defining the role of SERCA2a and phospholamban, or PLN, in modulating cardiac contraction, and discovering new small molecules to modulate SERCA2a activity or new drugs for treating chronic and acute human heart failure. The initial term of the 2015 Agreement, which was three years, was extended for approximately an additional year, with an option for further renewal. In June 2019, we entered into a new Agreement for Scientific Collaboration with Bicocca, or the 2019 Agreement, focused on continuing the studies under the 2015 Agreement. The 2019 Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior agreements with Bicocca.
 
Under the 2019 Agreement, we provided funds aggregating € 0.16 million (approximately $0.178 million) to extend our use of Bicocca laboratories and to fund research conducted pursuant to the collaboration. (Under the 2015 Agreement, Bicocca had given us exclusive use of a research laboratory for the collaboration work, and nonexclusive access to a physiology laboratory within the university.) Under the 2019 Agreement, any results obtained from the collaboration are jointly owned by the parties. However, Bicocca has agreed to assign to us its interest in patent applications and patents covering any new SERCA2a activator compounds and diagnostic products suitable for further clinical development. We have agreed to pay Bicocca (corresponding to stage of development): (i) € 0.1 million (approximately $0.11 million) for new SERCA2a activator compounds developed up to phase 1 studies in humans upon the completion and availability of the proof of concept of biological efficacy of new compounds on modulating the SERCA2a activity in cell-free systems, or its functional counterpart in cardiac myocytes and (ii) € 1.5 million (approximately $1.7 million) upon obtaining marketing authorization in the U.S., EU, or China of new compounds with the corresponding companion diagnostic assay. We have also agreed to pay royalties on products generated from the collaboration in the range of a fraction of a single digit to a low single digit percent of net sales for any products sold in any country for a period of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or until the expiry of patent(s) covering the products.
 
On March 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement for Scientific Collaboration, or the New SERCA2a Agreement, with Bicocca, which extends our collaboration. The New SERCA2a Agreement amends and restates the recently expired terms of the prior collaboration agreement. Under the New SERCA2a Agreement, we will provide Bicocca with approximately € 0.2 million (approximately $0.2 million) for research activities and to cover laboratory space and operation costs. Results obtained from the collaboration will be jointly owned by the parties. However, Bicocca will assign to us its interest in patent applications and patents covering any new SERCA2a compounds and diagnostic products suitable for further clinical development. We have agreed to pay Bicocca (corresponding to stage of development): (i) € 25,000 (approximately $30,000) for execution of an assignment to the Company of Bicocca’s interest in the patent at issue, (ii) € 75,000 (approximately $90,000) for new SERCA2a compounds developed up to phase 1 studies in humans upon the completion and availability of the proof of concept of biological efficacy of new compounds on modulating the SERCA2a activity in cell-free systems, or its functional counterpart in isolated cells and (iii) € 1.5 million (approximately $1.8 million) upon obtaining marketing authorization in the U.S., EU, or China of new compounds with the corresponding companion diagnostic assay. We have also agreed to pay royalties on products generated from the collaboration in the range of a fraction of a single digit to a low single digit percent of net sales for any products sold in any country for a period of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or until the expiry of patent(s) covering the products.
 
Philip Morris License Agreements
 
In 2008, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Philip Morris USA, Inc., or PMUSA, with respect to the U.S., or the U.S. License Agreement, and, as PMUSA had assigned its ex-U.S. rights to Philip Morris Products S.A., or PMPSA, effective on the same date and on substantially the same terms and conditions, we entered into a license agreement with PMPSA with respect to rights outside of the U.S., which we refer to, together with the U.S. License Agreement, as the PM License Agreements. Under the PM License Agreements, we have worldwide exclusive rights to the PMUSA and PMPSA proprietary capillary aerosol technology, which is a key component of our ADS, for use in a drug/device combination product with pulmonary surfactants (alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical compounds) for all respiratory diseases and conditions. In addition, under the U.S. License Agreement, our license to use the capillary aerosol technology includes certain non-surfactant drugs to treat certain designated pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. See also, “– Patents and Proprietary Rights – Aerosol Delivery System (ADS) Patent Rights.”
 
Under the PM License Agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties at a rate equal to a low single-digit percent of sales of products sold in the Exclusive Field (as defined in the PM License Agreements) in the territories. In connection with exclusive undertakings of PMUSA and PMPSA not to exploit the aerosol technology for all licensed uses, we are obligated to pay royalties on all product sales, including sales of certain aerosol devices that are not based on the licensed aerosol technology; provided, however, that no royalties are payable to the extent that we exercise our right to terminate the license with respect to a specific indication. We also have been required to pay minimum royalties quarterly but are entitled to reduce future quarterly royalties above the quarterly minimums in the amount of the true-up payments we make to satisfy minimum royalties for prior quarters. Our license rights extend to innovations to the aerosol technology that are made under the PM License Agreements.
 
In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreements, we may terminate the PM License Agreements, in whole or in part, upon advance written notice to the licensor. In addition, either party to each PM License Agreement may terminate upon a material breach by the other party (subject to a specified cure period). Our license under each PM License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will expire as to each licensed product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the date on which the sale of such licensed product ceases to be covered by a valid patent claim in such country; the date a generic form of the product is introduced in such country; or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product.

Battelle Collaboration Agreement
 
In October 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Battelle, or the Battelle Collaboration Agreement, for the development of our new ADS for use in our phase 3 program. We had previously worked with Battelle, which has expertise in developing and integrating aerosol devices using innovative and advanced technologies, in connection with development of our phase 2 ADS used in the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial. Under the Battelle Collaboration Agreement, we and Battelle shared the costs of development for a three-stage development plan that included planning, executing the project plan and testing and completing verification and documentation of a new phase 3 ADS, putting us in a position to manufacture a new phase 3 ADS for use in the remaining AEROSURF development activities, including a potential phase 3 clinical program, and, if approved, initial commercial activities. We retained final decision-making authority over all matters related to the design, registration, manufacture, packaging, marketing, distribution and sale of the phase 3 ADS. We and Battelle shared the costs of the project plan equally. Battelle agreed to bear the cost of any cost overruns associated with the project plan and we agreed to bear the cost of any increase in cost resulting from changes in the scope of the product requirements. We also agreed that, if Battelle successfully completed the project plan in a timely manner, we would pay Battelle royalties equal to a low single-digit percentage of the worldwide net sales and license royalties on sales of AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, up to an initial aggregate limit of $25.0 million, which under a payment restructuring agreement (discussed below), was increased to $35.0 million. The Battelle Collaboration Agreement will end at the time we fulfill our payment obligations to Battelle, unless sooner terminated by a party as provided therein.
 
In December 2018, we entered into a payment restructuring agreement with Battelle, or the Battelle Payment Restructuring Agreement, in which we agreed, among other things, as follows: (i) the outstanding amounts then due to Battelle, or the Battelle Payables, under a Research and Development Services Agreement dated as of June 22, 2012, or the RDSA, and the Battelle Collaboration Agreement would continue to accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum; (ii) AEROSURF development activities thereafter would be performed under the RDSA; (iii) Battelle would participate in a December 2018 private placement offering and exchange $1.0 million of the debt for shares of our common stock; and (iv) upon the closing of the December 2018 private placement, we paid Battelle cash in the amount of $1.0 million and thereafter initiated payments totaling an aggregate $1.25 million in 2019. In addition, we agreed to make two milestone payments to Battelle as follows: (i) upon enrollment of the first patient in the next AEROSURF clinical study, or the First Milestone, an amount equal to one half of the then-outstanding Battelle Payables, including unpaid interest, and (ii) upon completion of the device technology transfer for the new ADS to Mack, or the Second Milestone, an amount equal to the then-outstanding Battelle Payables, including unpaid interest. If any amounts of the Battelle Payables remained unpaid by December 31, 2019, then all unpaid Battelle Payables would be due on January 7, 2020. Neither milestone was achieved as of December 31, 2019. On March 30, 2020, we and Battelle entered into an amendment to the Battelle Payment Restructuring Agreement such that the First Milestone and Second Milestone payments would be payable no later than April 15, 2020 and September 1, 2020, respectively. In April 2020, we made the First Milestone payment of $0.8 million to Battelle and announced enrollment of the first patient into the AEROSURF phase 2 bridging study. In September 2020, we made the final Second Milestone payment of $0.8 million to Battelle.
 
Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A. Strategic Alliance
 
We have a strategic alliance with Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A., or Esteve, for the development, marketing and sales of a portfolio of potential KL4 surfactant products in Andorra, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, or, collectively, the Territory. Under the alliance, Esteve will pay us a transfer price on sales of our KL4 surfactant products. We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of all covered products and Esteve will be responsible for all sales and marketing in the Territory. Esteve is obligated to make stipulated cash payments to us upon our achievement of certain milestones, primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for the covered products. In addition, Esteve has agreed to contribute to phase 3 clinical trials for the covered products by conducting and funding development performed in the Territory. As part of a 2004 restructuring, Esteve returned certain countries to us, referred to as the Former Esteve Territories, and we agreed to pay Esteve 10% of any cash up front and milestone fees (up to a maximum aggregate of $20.0 million) that we receive in connection with any strategic collaborations for the development and/or commercialization of certain of our KL4 surfactant products in the Former Esteve Territories. In addition, with respect to our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, Esteve will pay us $0.5 million upon the initial filing for regulatory approval with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and $0.5 million upon receipt of regulatory approval. Esteve will also contribute up to $3 million to support a phase 3 clinical trial in the Territory. The alliance will terminate as to each covered product, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest to occur of: the expiration of the last patent claim related to a covered product in such country; the first commercial sale in such country of the first-to-appear generic formulation of the covered product, and the tenth anniversary of the first sale of the covered product in such country. In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreement by a party, the alliance agreement may be terminated by Esteve on 60 days’ prior written notice, up to the date of receipt of the first marketing regulatory approval, or, on up to six months’ written notice, if the first marketing regulatory approval has issued. We may terminate the alliance agreement in the event that Esteve acquires a competitive product (as defined in the agreement).
Johnson & Johnson License Agreement
 
Our precision-engineered KL4 surfactant technology was invented at The Scripps Research Institute, or Scripps, and was exclusively licensed to and further developed by Johnson & Johnson, or J&J. Pursuant to a license agreement, dated October 28th 1996, with J&J and its wholly owned subsidiary, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (the J&J license), we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license and sublicense to a series of over 30 patents and patent filings (worldwide), or the J&J Patents. All J&J Patents have expired. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay the licensors fees of up to $3.0 million in the aggregate upon our achievement of certain milestones, primarily upon receipt of marketing regulatory approvals for certain designated products. We have made milestone payments totaling $1.0 million to date. In addition, the agreement provides that we are required to pay royalties at different rates based on the type of revenue and country, in amounts in the range of a high single-digit percent of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) of licensed products sold by us or sublicensees, or, if greater, a percentage of royalty income from sublicensees in the low double digits. The license agreement provides that the license will expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the payment of royalties for all licensed products for ten years beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such country. Thereafter, the license agreement provides that royalties shall be paid in respect of a licensed product until the expiration of the last licensed patent containing a valid claim covering the licensed product in such country. For countries in the EU in which royalties are paid only by virtue of licensed know-how, royalties shall be payable commencing from the date of first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such country and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which the licensed know-how becomes public or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in any country of the EU. In addition to customary termination provisions for breach of the agreement by a party, we may terminate the agreement, as to countries other than the U.S. and Western Europe territories (as defined in the agreement), on a country-by-country basis, on six months’ prior written notice; and as to the entire agreement, on 60 days’ prior written notice.

Intellectual Property
 
We continue to invest in maintaining and enforcing our potential competitive position through a number of means: (i) by protecting our exclusive rights in our cardiovascular agents including istaroxime, rostafuroxin and SERCA2a activators, (ii) by protecting our exclusive rights in our lyophilized KL4 surfactant, ADS and aerosol-conducting airway connector technologies through patents that we own or exclusively license, (iii) by seeking regulatory exclusivities, including potential Orphan Drug and new drug product exclusivities, and (iv) through protecting our trade secrets and proprietary methodologies that support our manufacturing and analytical processes.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
In addition to the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been active in identifying and seeking to identify new inventions eligible for patent protection. We have filed and plan to file patent and provisional patent applications to protect our innovations relating to our current and potential future product candidates, including for composition of matter, new dosage forms, formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of use and related processes. We intend to file for patent protection for select inventions, in such markets that we deem material to our patent strategy, as well as for other new inventions that we may identify.
CVie Therapeutics Patents and CVie/Windtree Therapeutics Patent Applications
 
Together with our subsidiary, CVie Therapeutics Limited, we hold a patent portfolio of six patent families that include patents and patent applications directed to compounds, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of manufacturing, methods of delivery, and/or treatment methods using istaroxime, rostafuroxin, their metabolites and/or derivatives, as well as SERCA2a activators, for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and related conditions.

Other Regulatory Designations
 
Orphan Drug and Orphan Medicinal Product Designations
 
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of ARDS in adults, and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. See the section titled “- Government Regulation - Drug Products - Orphan Drugs.”
 
The European Commission, or EC, grants Orphan Medicinal Product designation for pharmaceutical products for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than 5 in 10,000 people which provides for exclusive marketing rights for indications in Europe for 10 years (subject to revision after six years) following marketing approval by the EMA. In addition, the designation would enable us to receive regulatory assistance in the further development process, and to access reduced regulatory fees throughout its marketing life. The EC has granted Orphan Medicinal Product designation for (i) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention of RDS in premature neonates of less than 32 weeks gestational age, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of RDS in premature neonates of less than 37 weeks gestational age, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of ALI (which in this circumstance encompasses ARDS), and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of CF. In submitting the requests to the EMA for Orphan Medicinal Product designations, instead of listing the drug product under the USAN name (lucinactant) as we have in the U.S., we were required to submit our requests under the names of the four APIs in our KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) as follows: sinapultide (KL4), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol and palmitic acid.

Fast Track Designations
 
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for (i) istaroxime for the treatment of AHF, (ii) AEROSURF for the treatment of RDS in premature neonates, and (iii) SURFAXIN® for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature neonates and the treatment of ARDS in adults. We believe that other of our products may qualify for Fast Track or breakthrough therapy designation or other expedited programs. These designations and programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. See the section titled “- Government Regulation - Drug Products - Fast Track Designation.”
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is a highly competitive industry. As we work to gain marketing authorization for our product candidates, in some therapeutic areas, competition from numerous existing pharmaceutical companies and other companies entering our fields is expected to be intense and expected to increase. In fact, our future competitors are competing with us currently to secure access to development resources, including clinical sites and their patients to advance development programs. We expect that those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Moreover, there are also existing therapies that may compete with the products we are developing. Therefore, as a development stage biotechnology company, our competitors are comprised of other biotechnology firms and pharmaceutical companies that have existing products or are developing products for our primary markets -- respiratory and cardiovascular indications.
Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, clearance, labeling, promotion, advertising and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve or clear pending new submissions to market drugs or devices warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before they may be marketed in the U.S. Drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries.
Drug Products
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which the FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of the FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
   15

 

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit- risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. may be accepted by the FDA subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an onsite inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection or other appropriate means.
 
The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,875,000 for fiscal year 2021, and the applicant under an approved new drug application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $336,000 per product for fiscal year 2021. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and the FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
   16

 

Emergency Use Authorization
 
The FDA has the authority to grant an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. When issuing an EUA, the FDA imposes conditions of authorization, with which the company must comply. Such conditions include, but may not be limited to, compliance with labeling, distribution of materials designed to ensure proper use, reporting obligations, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. The EUA is only effective for the duration of the public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, the company fails to comply with the conditions of authorization of the EUA or the drug is determined to be less effective or safe than it was initially believed to be.
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition - generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven- year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan Drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Fast Track Designation
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
Under the Fast Track program, sponsors have the opportunity to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
   17

 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Market Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDC Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDC Act provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not receive for review an ANDA or file a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDC Act also provides three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions for use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the non-clinical studies and adequate and well- controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Patent Term Extension
 
After NDA approval, the owner of a relevant drug patent may apply for up to five years of patent term extension. Only one patent may be extended for each regulatory review period, which is composed of two parts: a testing phase, and an approval phase. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase - the time between the day the IND becomes effective and NDA submission - and all of the review phase - the time between NDA submission and approval - up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total remaining patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent term extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent term extension granted, the post-approval patent term extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent term extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to- consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by the FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or Biologics License Application, or BLA, submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 
   18

 

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Medical Device Products
 
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory which is: (i) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the US Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them; (ii) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or (iii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
 
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed.
 
Generally, establishments that manufacture and/or distribute devices, including manufacturers, contract manufacturers, sterilizers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, reprocessors of single-use devices, remanufacturers, initial importers, manufacturers of accessories and components sold directly to the end user, and U.S. manufacturers of export-only devices, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
 
Pre-market Authorization and Notification
 
While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a premarket approval application, or PMA, prior to marketing, generally applicable to Class III devices; or (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because the FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices. Other less common regulatory pathways to market for certain devices include the de novo classification process, the humanitarian device exception, or HDE, or a product development protocol, or PDP.
The 510(k) Clearance Process
 
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device.
 
A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, often referred to as a preamendments device, and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA has a performance goal to complete its review of 95% of 510(k) submissions within 90 days of receipt. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, because the FDA can request additional date and information, which pauses the review clock for up to 180 days, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to- file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s).
 
   19

 

The PMA Approval Process
 
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has a performance goal to review 90% of PMA applications within 180 days, if advisory committee input is not required, and within 320 days, if advisory committee input is required, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (i.e., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
 

● | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from preclinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life- sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 
Exempt Devices
 
If a manufacturer’s device falls into a generic category of Class I or Class II devices that the FDA has exempted by regulation, a premarket notification is not required before marketing the device in the U.S. Manufacturers of such devices are required to register their establishments and list the proprietary device name and the generic category or classification regulation into which the device fits. Some 510(k)-exempt devices are also exempt from Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements.
Post-market Requirements
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act).
 
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution.

Combination Products
 
A combination product is a product comprised of (i) two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/medical device, biologic/medical device, drug/biologic, or drug/medical device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where, upon approval of the proposed product, the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, i.e., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
 
The FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center.
 
Regulation Outside the U.S.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside the U.S. require that clinical trial applications be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the U.S. before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an Orphan Drug under EU regulatory systems, we are mandated to submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, in centralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which came into operation in 1995, allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products and for human products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the Community before May 20, 2004 (date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) and which are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the Community before May 20, 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a Community authorization is in the interests of patients at Community level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the EMA, to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The procedure results in an EC decision, which is valid in all EU Member States. Centrally-authorized products may be marketed in all EU Member States.
 
In centralized procedure, full copies of the MAA are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA’s assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MAA has been granted. The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant’s replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and, taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it shall include the draft summary of the product’s characteristics, the package leaflet and the texts proposed for the various packaging materials. The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days. The EMA then has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the EC. This is the start of the second phase of the procedure: the decision-making process.
 
The EMA sends to the EC its opinion and assessment report, together with annexes containing: the SmPC (Annex 1); the particulars of the Marketing Authorisation Holder, or MAH, responsible for batch release, the particulars of the manufacturer of the active substance and the conditions of the marketing authorization (Annex 2); and the labeling and the package leaflet (Annex 3). The annexes are translated into the 22 other official languages of the EU. During the decision-making process, the EC services verify that the marketing authorization complies with EU law. The EC has fifteen days to prepare a draft decision. The medicinal product is assigned a Community registration number, which will be placed on its packaging if the marketing authorization is granted. During this period, various EC directorates general are consulted on the draft marketing authorization decision. The draft decision is then sent to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (EU Member States have one representative each in both of these committees) for their opinions.
 
The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to the public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states.

Applications from persons or companies seeking “orphan medicinal product designation” for products they intend to develop for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU are reviewed by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP. In addition, Orphan Drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed Orphan Drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for fee reductions for protocol assistance and access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing approval, which reductions are not limited to the first year after marketing approval for small and medium enterprises. In addition, if a product which has an Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives EMA marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means the EMA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 10 years. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Competitors may receive marketing approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In order to do so, however, they must demonstrate that the new drugs or biologics provide a significant benefit over the existing orphan product. This demonstration of significant benefit may be done at the time of initial approval or in post-approval studies, depending on the type of marketing authorization granted.
 
A pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the EU. Medicines authorized across the EU with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months. This is the case even when the studies’ results are negative. For orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization, or PUMA. If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive.
 
The European Union Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. This directive has been separately enacted in more detail in the national legislation of the individual member states of the EU. The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certificated device is marked with CE mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for CE mark varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled before CE mark can be placed on a product, known as a conformity assessment. Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the EU without further conformance tests being required in other member states. In April 2017, changes were made to the legal framework for the regulation of medical devices in the EU, including in vitro diagnostics. The changes were prompted by divergent interpretations of the current directives and to address issues concerning product quality and performance. A three-year transitional period for application of the new framework was extended in April 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the extension, the new regulations for medical devices, Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices, referred to as the MDR, will fully apply beginning in May 2021. The new regulations for in vitro diagnostics, Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices, referred to as the IVDR, will fully apply beginning in May 2022.
 
In a referendum held in the United Kingdom, or UK, on June 23, 2016, a majority of those voting voted for the UK to leave the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The effective date of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU was January 31, 2020. A transition period, which ended December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. Over the past year, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has issued additional guidance on numerous occasions to address how drugs and devices are to be regulated in the UK post-Brexit. However, the ultimate impact of the “leave” is not clear as there is still some legal and practical uncertainty surrounding the regulation of drugs and devices in the UK and how such regulation may diverge with regulation in the EU.
 
International Approvals
 
Drug products, medical devices, and drug/medical device combination products are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the U.S. but are not harmonized. International regulators are independent and not bound by the findings of the FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept clinical trial design/results or may require additional data or other information not requested by the FDA. In addition, international regulators may require different manufacturing practices than the FDA’s cGMPs.
 
Reimbursement
 
Potential sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product candidate, if approved, or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In the U.S., the Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary outpatient drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries for certain products. We do not know whether our product candidates, if approved, will be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but individual Medicare Part D plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies.

Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws and Other Regulations
 
In addition to the FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, medical devices, and combination products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the medical product industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information.
 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 
Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
Privacy and Security laws
 
HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose privacy, security transmission and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information, including protected health information, or PHI, upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that perform services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, including PHI. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
 
Many states have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, to which we are subject. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.
 
Federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, may require us to undertake compliance efforts that could be costly and time consuming or subject us to liability for a failure to comply.
 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
 
Manufacturers of prescription drugs are required to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports must be submitted on an annual basis and the reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives will also be required.
 
   23

 

In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Additional jurisdictions, such as the City of Chicago and the District of Columbia, require pharmaceutical sales representatives to be licensed and meet continuing education requirements. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act.
 
On January 20, 2017, former President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act pending further action by Congress. In October 2017, he signed an Executive Order which directed federal agencies to modify how the Affordable Care Act is implemented. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021.
 
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act , effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans by increasing from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
 
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. As noted above, the 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase.
 
   24

 

Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.

In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these antibribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 
CVie Acquisition
 
In December 2018, we acquired CVie Investments Limited, or CVie Investments, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, which we refer to herein as the CVie Acquisition. Since the CVie Acquisition, we have operated CVie Investments and its wholly owned subsidiary, CVie Therapeutics Limited, a Taiwan corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of China, as a subsidiary focused on the development of drug product candidates for cardiovascular diseases.
 
In connection with the CVie Acquisition, our Board declared a dividend to the holders of record of outstanding shares of our common stock, and holders of certain warrants to purchase common stock, in each case that were outstanding on December 20, 2018, of 0.6148 AEROSURF Warrant, for each share of common stock held by a shareholder or each warrant held by a warrant holder, as applicable, on the record date, or the AEROSURF Warrants. Each AEROSURF Warrant has a term of five years and provides for automatic exercise into one share of common stock, without any exercise price, upon our public announcement of the dosing of the first human subject enrolled in our phase 3 clinical trial for AEROSURF. We expect to distribute upon exercise of the AEROSURF Warrants an aggregate of 987,722 shares of common stock. We anticipate that the automatic exercise of the AEROSURF Warrants will occur upon enrollment of the first patient in an AEROSURF phase 3 clinical trial conducted by either ourselves or a licensee.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 29, 2021, we have 31 full-time employees, 26 of whom are based in the U.S. Our employees are skilled in drug and device development, including clinical trial design, clinical operations in support of our clinical trials and related activities, corporate administration, finance and business development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also work with independent professional advisors and consultants to support our program development activities, particularly in the areas of drug product development, regulatory, compliance, and international clinical operations.
 
We believe our human capital resources are fundamental to our success; as such, our corporate objectives include recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating existing and new employees, advisors and consultants for the common purpose of increasing stockholder value and promoting the success of our company. Our compensation and equity incentive programs are designed to attract, retain and reward personnel through cash-based compensation and granting of stock-based awards intended to motivate such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and advance our corporate objectives. We endeavor to provide competitive benefits that will reward and retain our employees. Our compensation program includes competitive salary and annual bonus programs, comprehensive healthcare benefits for employees and dependent family members, paid time off, paid holidays, family medical leave and flexible work schedules. We sponsor a 401(k) plan and automatically enroll all employees when eligible and generally provide a discretionary matching corporate contribution. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and our company, and which complied with government regulations. This included initially providing all employees the option of working from home, while implementing additional workplace safety measures for employees working on site.
