Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing products for treating inflammatory and immune diseases with a focus on the eye and nervous system.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired Panoptes Ges.m.b.H. (“Panoptes”), transforming our pipeline with the addition of PP-001, a clinical stage Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (“DHODH”) inhibitor. PP-001, is a next-generation, non-steroidal, immuno-modulatory and small-molecule inhibitor of DHODH with what we believe to be best-in-class picomolar potency and a validated immune modulating mechanism designed to overcome the off-target side effects and safety issues typically associated with DHODH inhibitors. PP-001 has been developed in two clinical-stage ophthalmic formulations: PaniJect, an intravitreal injection for inflammatory diseases of the eye including posterior uveitis, and PaniDrop, a novel nano carrier technology eye drop for ocular surface diseases such as conjunctivitis, dry eye disease and others. Other administration routes are also in development and Investigational New Drug (“IND”) enabling studies are underway for conditions outside the ocular space.
 
In addition, we are developing Ocular Bandage Gel (“OBG”), a modified form of the natural polymer hyaluronic acid, designed to protect the ocular surface to permit re-epithelialization of the cornea and improve ocular surface integrity. OBG, with unique properties that help hydrate and protect the ocular surface, is in clinical evaluation for patients undergoing photorefractive keratectomy (“PRK”) surgery for corneal wound repair after refractive surgery and patients with punctate epitheliopathies (“PE”) as a result of dry eye. We are currently developing OBG as a device, but are evaluating the potential to reclassify OBG as a drug. We attended a type-B meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) division during the first quarter of 2021 to discuss OBG’s path forward as a drug and will continue to evaluate the feedback received as we move towards reaching a decision on the reclassification.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to continue developing products for treating disorders of the eye and to expand development to indications outside of ophthalmology. The key elements of this strategy are to:

• | Evaluate the current clinical development programs in ophthalmology of the newly acquired small molecule, PP-001. This includes PaniJect for retinal diseases and PaniDrop for diseases of the ocular surface, which have completed dose-ascending human clinical safety studies in Europe. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate the research and development programs for other routes of administration of PP-001, specifically outside of ophthalmology. We are assessing a broad range of potential therapeutic areas including oncology, autoimmune disease, and viral infection. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finalize the evaluation to determine reclassification of OBG from a device to a drug. This includes assessing the feedback from a type-B meeting with the FDA’s CDER division during the first quarter of 2021. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue clinical development of OBG for the treatment of dry eye disease. In the first quarter of 2020, we announced positive topline data in our follow-on pilot study, which evaluated several different exploratory endpoints. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We completed clinical development as a device for the indication of wound healing in patients who have undergone PRK surgery. We will assess the path forward for this indication if OBG is reclassified as a drug. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue strategic collaborations. We plan to evaluate opportunities to enter collaborations that may contribute to our ability to advance our product candidates and to progress concurrently a range of discovery and development programs. We also plan to evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates, or technologies.

Market Opportunity
 
PP-001 Overview
 
PP-001 is a third-generation small molecule DHODH inhibitor. DHODH is extensively exploited as potential drug targets for immunological disorders, oncology, and infectious diseases. DHODH is a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This enzyme is located in the mitochondria and catalyzes the conversion of dihydroorotate (“DHO”) to orotate as the fourth step in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines that are ultimately used in the production of nucleotides.
 
Nucleotides are required for cell growth and replication. Nucleotides are the activated precursors of nucleic acids and are necessary for the replication of the genome and the transcription of the genetic information into RNA. Nucleotides also serve as an energy source for a more select group of biological processes (ATP and GTP). They also play a role in the formation of glycogen, signal-transduction pathways, and as components of co-enzymes (NAD and FAD). An ample supply of nucleotides in the cell is essential for all cellular processes.
 
There are two pathways for the biosynthesis of nucleotides: salvage and de novo. The main difference is where the nucleotide bases come from. In the salvage pathway, the bases are recovered (salvaged) from RNA and DNA degradation. In the de novo pathway, the bases are assembled from simple precursor molecules (made from scratch).
 
One critical requirement of fast-growing or proliferating cells, such as the expansion of activated B and T-cells, cancer cells, and pathogen infected host cells, is the requirement of an abundance of nucleotide bases. These metabolic activities will predominately utilize the de novo pathway for nucleotide biosynthesis. A key advantage of DHODH inhibition is the selectivity towards metabolically activated cells (with a high need for RNA and DNA production), which should mitigate any negative impact on normal cells. Depletion of cellular pyrimidine pools through the selective inhibition of DHODH has been shown to be a successful approach for therapeutic development.
 
Currently, two first generation DHODH inhibitors have been approved in the U.S. and abroad and are marketed by Sanofi as leflunomide (Arava®) and the active metabolite teriflunomide (Aubagio®). These oral tablets are approved for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis and multiple sclerosis (“MS”), respectively. Both diseases are autoimmune disorders. One potential explanation for the therapeutic effects of Arava® in arthritis is the reduction in the numbers or reactivity of activated T-cells, which are involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis. The generally accepted view of human MS pathogenesis implicates peripheral activation of myelin-specific autoreactive T-cells that lead to inflammatory disease in the central nervous system (“CNS”). By blocking the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway via DHODH inhibition, it is suggested that Aubagio® reduces T-cell proliferation in the periphery. Arava® and Aubagio® are formulated as oral drugs and it is established that leflunomide will be metabolized in the liver to the active metabolite teriflunomide. Hepatotoxicity was reported as a major side effect after oral administration, possibly as a result of extensive liver metabolization. Moreover, it was shown that apart from DHOHD, a series of protein kinases are inhibited by Arava® and Aubagio®. 
  3

PP-001 was identified as a promising novel third generation DHODH inhibitor, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50-value of 0.3 nM. Based on internal work completed, we believe that this is more than 1,000-fold more potent than teriflunomide (IC50 DHODH 415 nM). Furthermore, PP-001 represses the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IFN-g,VEGF and others, potentially as a consequence of inhibiting DHODH. IL-17 and IFN-g are the hallmark cytokines expressed by Th1 and Th17 T-cells, respectively, and play a crucial role in initiating the inflammatory processes in several ocular diseases, including non-noninfectious uveitis and dry eye disease. PP-001 is structurally and mechanistically different from Arava®. The IC50 of PP-001 on selected tyrosine kinases, such as PI3K, AKT and JAK, is more than 10,000-fold above the IC50 of PP-001 for DHODH. In general, side effects are not expected and have not been observed to date in animal and human studies after PP-001 administration.
 
Despite the fact that the DHODH protein is ubiquitously expressed in most cells, malignant cells seem to be more metabolically dependent on de novo pyrimidine production, forming the potential basis of a therapeutic window. Inhibiting DHODH alone or in combination with standard-of-care has been shown to be very active in a series of different in vivo cancer models for AML, breast, lung, and others.
 
Additionally, viral replication and viral cell metabolism is dependent on a large nucleotide pool. Therefore, PP-001 demonstrates antiviral efficacy, which is likely due to pyrimidine depletion caused by DHODH inhibition. The postulated DHODH directed mode of action of PP-001 is underlined by reversibility of the antiviral activity by co-application of uridine or other pyrimidine precursors.
 
The postulated mode of action of PP-001 is depicted below.

OBG Overview
 
OBG is a synthetic modified hyaluronic acid (“HA”) capable of coating the ocular surface and designed to resist degradation under conditions present in the eye. This prolongs residence time of the bandage on the ocular surface, thereby addressing the limitations of current non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid formulations. Additionally, cross-linking allows the product’s viscosity to be modified to meet optimum ocular needs. The increased viscosity and non-covalent muco-adhesive interfacial forces improve residence time in the tear film, thus providing a coating that aids and promotes re-epithelization of the ocular surface via physical protection. If OBG is approved by the FDA, we expect that it will be the only prescription eye drop available in the U.S. based on HA.
 
OBG exhibits significant shear thinning properties. This feature allows the modified HA to act as a more concentrated, viscous barrier at low shear rates in a resting tear film, but also as a lower resistance fluid (therefore thinned) during high shear events such as blinking. This property enables better residence time and a more favorable ocular surface coating with less optical blur. We have demonstrated in animal studies that OBG remains on the ocular surface for up to two hours and further demonstrated in a human clinical study that OBG does not cause blurriness while on the ocular surface. This enhances ocular surface protection and patient comfort.
 
OBG has been shown to provide a mechanical barrier that aids in the management of corneal epithelial defects and re-epithelization in both preclinical studies and in clinical ophthalmic veterinary use. As such, PRK surgery was chosen as the subject population which is best suited to demonstrate this effect. PRK is an efficacious alternative to patients seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for laser in situ keratomileusis (“LASIK”) due to inadequate corneal thickness, larger pupil size, history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (“KCS”), or anterior basement membrane disease. OBG has demonstrated statistical significance in a pivotal clinical study for its ability to accelerate wound healing against the current standard-of-care, a bandage contact lens.
 
We believe that OBG can be used for the management of a variety of large and small corneal epithelial defects including PE, which also includes dry eye. PE is an early sign of epithelial compromise and is associated with a variety of pathologic ocular inflammatory conditions including ocular causes, as well as systemic diseases. This ocular surface condition is common and may represent areas of epithelial cell damage and loss and therefore stain positively with fluorescein. Causes can include dry eye, acute and chronic bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, trauma, contact lens wear (tight lens syndrome), chemical irritation and burns, diabetic and infectious neuropathies, chemotherapy, and corneal abrasion. OBG demonstrated its ability to reduce corneal staining, which occurs when the compromised corneal epithelial defects heal, in a pilot study in dry eye patients when compared against Refresh® lubricating eye drops.

Potential Targeted Indications
 
We are undergoing an assessment of routes of administration for PP-001 and which diseases to focus our resources on. This will include a review of existing routes of delivery, specifically PaniJect and PaniDrop, and may determine that it is not in our best interest to continue with both ophthalmic routes of administration.
 
PaniJect 
 
PaniJect is being considered for multiple diseases that affect the posterior region of the eye (the retina), including Non-Infectious Posterior Uveitis (“NIPU”) and Diabetic Macular Edema (“DME”).
 
PaniDrop
 
PaniDrop is being considered for multiple diseases that affect the ocular surface and anterior region of the eye, including Allergic Conjunctivitis, Viral Conjunctivitis and Dry Eye Disease (“DED”).
 
OBG 
 
Punctate Epitheliopathies due to Dry Eye 
 
PE is an early sign of epithelial compromise and is associated with a variety of pathologic ocular inflammatory conditions including ocular causes, as well as systemic diseases. This ocular surface condition is common and may represent areas of epithelial cell damage and loss and therefore stain positively with fluorescein. PE is characterized by a breakdown or damage of the epithelium of the cornea in a pinpoint pattern, which can be seen by examination with a slit lamp. Patients may present with non-specific symptoms such as red eye, tearing, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and burning. Causes can include dry eye, acute and chronic bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, trauma, contact lens wear (tight lens syndrome), chemical irritation and burns, diabetic and infectious neuropathies, chemotherapy, and corneal abrasion.
 
Standard-of-care treatments are aimed at attempting to heal these punctate micro defects and/or epitheliopathies and can include increasing humidity, artificial tears, lubricants, and ointments and in severe cases can even utilize bandage contact lens, antibiotics and amniotic membrane graphs, as well as treating the underlying cause with topical anti-inflammatory and T-cell modulators. Often these current treatments fall short, as they are ineffective in protecting and enabling corneal re-epithelization. The artificial tears have limited residence time and often do nothing to mechanically protect the cornea and create an environment that can manage corneal re-epithelization. Furthermore, many of the ointments and gels, although offering better residence time, are thicker and blur vision, thus making them less attractive for daytime use.
 
OBG, once applied to the eye, forms a thin layer that protects and lubricates the eye to promote re-epithelization in the management of a variety of large and small corneal epithelial defects including PE.
 
Corneal Wound Repair 
 
OBG has been shown to provide a mechanical barrier that aids in the management of corneal epithelial defects and re-epithelization in both preclinical studies and in clinical ophthalmic veterinary use. PRK surgery was chosen as the subject population that is best suited to demonstrate this effect. PRK is an efficacious alternative to patients seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for LASIK due to inadequate corneal thickness, larger pupil size, history of KCS, or anterior basement membrane disease. PRK involves controlled mechanical removal of corneal epithelium with subsequent excimer laser photoablation of the underlying Bowman’s layer and anterior stroma, including the subepithelial nerve plexus.
 
The military prefers PRK as a refractive surgery due to the stability of the PRK incision and the absence of risk for flap dislocation during military active duty. Although this procedure yields desirable visual acuity results, common complications of the procedure include post-operative pain secondary to the epithelial defects, risk of corneal infection prior to re-epithelization of the large epithelial defect, corneal haze formation, decreased contrast sensitivity, and slower visual recovery.
 
OBG provides a thin coating to the surface of the eye, serving as a protectant and lubricant to facilitate and manage corneal re-epithelization.

Clinical Trial Results
 
PaniJect: Non-Infectious Posterior Uveitis
 
Phase 1a/2b Safety Study
 
A first in human clinical study to evaluate the safety of intravitreally applied PP-001 in patients with chronic, non-infectious uveitis has been completed. PP-001 was applied as a single, intravitreal injection of 300, 600 and 1,200 ng per eye. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of PP-001 in patients. The secondary objectives were to assess improvement of intraocular inflammation and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PP-001 in patients. For this study, PP-001 was formulated as a sterile, aqueous solution for intravitreal injection.
 
The purpose of this study was to assess safety, pharmacokinetic (“PK”), and efficacy data of 12 treated patients. PP-001 showed an excellent safety profile and promising efficacy signals in improvement of inflammatory parameters and visual acuity in uveitis patients.
 
Assessment of the evaluated efficacy parameters shows a clear dose dependent treatment effect in improvement of visual acuity at day 14 post dosing. Figure 1 shows the mean change in letters read from baseline for patients treated in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 (300, 600, and 1,200 ng per eye).

Analyzing only the highest dose group (1200 ng per eye, cohort 3), a fundamental mean improvement of visual acuity is seen in the patients, which started within the first week post injection (day 7) and lasted beyond the last study visit (day 28). Figure 2 shows the mean letters read change from baseline to study days 7, 14, and 28 for patients treated in cohort 3.
 


Figure 2: Improvement of visual acuity in cohort 3 on study days 7, 14, and 28
 
Apart from improved visual acuity, improvements in vitreous haze and reduction in macular edema were observed in the patients treated with PP-001.
 
PaniDrop: Healthy Volunteers
 
Phase 1 Safety Study:
 
A Phase I safety and tolerability study of PP-001 eye drops in healthy adult volunteers was completed. In this study, healthy volunteers were repeatedly treated with ascending doses of PP-001 and placebo eyedrops. 0.05 and 0.15% eyedrops showed excellent tolerability. Both doses can be used for future studies in patients having an infection or inflammation on the ocular surface.

OBG: Corneal Wound Repair
 
Pivotal Study:
 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported positive topline results from our corneal wound repair pivotal clinical trial of OBG for the corneal re-epithelialization in patients having undergone PRK surgery. The prospective, controlled study randomized 234 patients undergoing bilateral PRK surgery and was designed to assess safety and efficacy by comparing EyeGate’s OBG to the current standard- of-care, a bandage contact lens (“BCL”). The primary endpoint was the proportion of study eyes achieving complete wound closure on Day 3 (and remaining closed). This assessment was evaluated by an independent masked reading center, using digital slit-lamp photographs of fluorescein staining in all treated eyes, and a protocol-driven method to quantify the outcomes.
 
The enrolled patients were randomized into one of two study groups, with patients receiving the same treatment in both eyes: 
 

• | Arm 1 (n=117) was comprised of OBG QID for two weeks after surgery. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Arm 2 (n=117) was comprised of BCL administered four times daily. 

 


OBG demonstrated superiority for the primary endpoint with a p-value of 0.0203. The statistical significance measurement was based on the number of patients in each arm that achieved complete corneal defect closure three days post refractive surgery. At Day 3, 80.2% of eyes receiving the OBG treatment regimen were completely healed, compared with 67.0% for BCL. Additionally, at Day 2, the average wound size for all eyes treated with OBG was 3.61 mm2, compared to 6.66 mm2 for eyes treated with BCL, which is 46% smaller than the standard-of-care.

OBG: Punctate Epitheliopathies with a Focus on Dry Eye
 
Follow-On Pilot Study:
 
In the first quarter of 2020, we reported positive topline results from the follow-on clinical trial of OBG evaluating the potential to help clinicians better manage patients with dry eye. This positive controlled, investigator masked study enrolled 20 patients, or 40 eyes, with dry eye. This study confirmed the ability of OBG eye drops to demonstrate improvement of the ocular surface for several important ophthalmic endpoints. OBG eye drops showed an improvement in central corneal region staining, high order ocular aberrations (“HOA”) and best corrected visual acuity (“BCVA”), outperforming the positive control, Allergan’s Refresh Plus Preservative-Free (“Refresh Plus”) lubricant eye drop.
 
Prior to randomization there was a one-week run in period where all patients took Refresh eye drops only in both eyes. Patients with a corneal staining score of ≥4, using the NEI scale, and a tear film break-up time (“TFBUT”) of ≤7 seconds at Day 0, or at the end of the 7-day run-in period, then entered the 14-day treatment phase. To be randomized at Day 0, both eyes had to qualify and have similar scores for staining and TFBUT. The patient acted as their own control and one eye was treated with Refresh Plus eye drops and the other eye was treated with OBG eye drops. 
 
The twenty enrolled patients had one eye randomized to the OBG treatment group and the other eye randomized to the Refresh Plus treatment group, for a total of 40 eyes randomized: 
 

• | Arm 1 (n=20 eyes) received OBG eye drops four times daily for four weeks. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Arm 2 (n=20 eyes) received Refresh Plus eye drops four times daily for four weeks.

 


The primary endpoint was based on corneal epithelial healing as measured by fluorescein staining. Punctates are a sign of epithelial compromise (corneal barrier disruption) which is characterized by a breakdown of the epithelium of the cornea and an increased permeability to fluorescein dye. Thus, fluorescein dye is used to clinically evaluate the severity of corneal barrier disruption. The National Eye Institutes (“NEI”) scale was used, which divides the cornea into five different regions. Each region was scored on a scale from 0 to 3 for a total maximum score of 15 (a higher score represented a more severe disruption of the corneal barrier). To be randomized into the study, each eye had to have a minimum total score of 4.
 
At all visits, all corneal regions were assessed, but of particular interest due to vision quality involvement and corneal sensitivity, is the central region of the cornea. All 20 patients randomized had a minimum scoring for the whole cornea (i.e., all 5 regions) of at least 4 (maximum score = 15) in both eyes, and 16 of these patients also had a minimum score of at least 1 (maximum score = 3) in the central region of the cornea in both eyes. OBG demonstrated a positive treatment effect as compared to Refresh Plus at both Day 7 and Day 14. The overall improvement (i.e., reduction in staining) at Day 14 was approximately 27% from baseline versus only approximately 9% for the positive control, Refresh Plus eye drops. OBG also showed improvement more quickly than Refresh Plus eye drops with an approximately 10% reduction in staining versus an increase in staining of approximately 7% for the Refresh Plus treatment group.
  10



The uniqueness of OBG is the combination of the high viscosity profile with a high shear rate. This means that with blinking or other sources of shearing or energy that the viscosity of OBG temporarily drops. Thus, this clinical study was also used to confirm that OBG does not result in blurriness of vision while on the eye. After all endpoint assessments were completed, one drop of OBG and one drop of Refresh Plus was instilled onto each eye. This was completed in a masked fashion based on randomization of each eye per drop. BCVA measurements were taken at 30 and 60 minutes to determine if instillation of either OBG or Refresh Plus caused blurriness or a change in vision. At all assessment time points there was essentially no change in BCVA for OBG or Refresh Plus, but OBG did perform better than Refresh Plus. At 30 minutes post instillation, OBG saw a negative change of 0.4% versus a negative change of 1.0% for Refresh Plus. At 60 minutes, OBG had a positive effect of 0.2% versus a negative effect of 0.3% for Refresh Plus.

Clinical Development Plan

PP-001
 
The clinical development plan for all PP-001 routes of delivery is under assessment.
 
OBG
 
We are currently developing OBG as a device but are evaluating the potential to reclassify OBG as a drug. We attended a type-B meeting with the FDA’s CDER division during the first quarter of 2021 to discuss OBG’s path forward as a drug and will continue to evaluate the feedback received as we move towards reaching a decision on the reclassification.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Overview
 
We are building an intellectual property portfolio for our PP-001 and modified HA platforms and any other product candidates that we may develop, as well as other devices and product candidates for treatment of ocular indications in the U.S. and abroad. We currently seek, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our product candidates, methods of use, and processes for manufacture, and for other technologies, where appropriate. Our current policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on, and will continue to rely on, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, our ability to defend our patents, and our ability to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 
Patent Portfolio
 
Our patent portfolio includes drug delivery device patents directed to PP-001 as composition-of-matter, formulations thereof and its therapeutic uses in the treatment of viral and ocular disorders and diseases. In addition, further patent applications are directed to the modified HA platform in combination with active therapeutics to treat ocular diseases. These issued patents will expire between 2021 and 2036. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant new drug application or NDA. See “Government Regulation—Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity” below.
 
We and our subsidiaries have been developing drug compositions and drug delivery systems for non-invasive treatment on the eye for several years. These delivery systems include various patented and patent pending drug delivery devices, active therapeutics and combination device/therapeutic to treat components of the eye, such as the cornea, sclera, and combinations thereof. These devices and therapeutics have been further improved to provide better patient comfort levels, patient compliance and recovery times. We hold 11 U.S. patents and 43 international patents.

We currently require and will continue to require each of our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of such individual’s employment, consulting, or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
 
In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from such individual’s work performed for us, utilizing our property, or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed by a consultant for us. 

Sales and Marketing
 
If PP-001 or OBG is approved by the FDA for commercial sale, we may enter into agreements with third parties to sell PP-001 or OBG, or we may choose to market these directly to physicians in the United States or globally through our own sales and marketing force and related internal commercialization infrastructure. If we market PP-001 or OBG directly, we will need to incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management resources to establish and train an internal sales and marketing force to market and sell PP-001 or OBG.
Manufacturing
 
We currently do not have an in-house manufacturing capability for our products and as a result, we will depend heavily on third-party contract manufacturers to produce and package our products. We currently do not have any contractual relationships with third-party manufacturers. We intend to rely on third-party suppliers that we have used in the past for the manufacturing of various components that comprise our PP-001, OBG and other contemplated clinical trials.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors’ establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products currently being used for the indications that we may pursue, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.

Government Regulation
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
 
FDA approval is required before any new drug, can be marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves:
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice or GLP, regulation; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug or IND, for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice or cGMP regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application or NDA, which must be accepted for filing by the FDA; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, if applicable; and 
--+---------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
--+----------------------------------------

  16

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
 
Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the National Institutes of Health-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, the key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1: The product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
According to section 505 of the FDCA, there are three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the entity that performed the studies (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)).
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA enables an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its NDA. Using this approval pathway may allow us to rely in part on information in the public domain to support the safety and effectiveness of our products. The FDA may also require sponsors to perform additional clinical trials, measurements, or other types of studies or assessments (e.g., bridging studies) to support any change from the previously approved product. The review process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
 
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents listed for the approved product on which the application relies in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly referred to as the Orange Book). Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the unchallenged listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not accept or approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
 
If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for submission by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid, or not infringed, whichever is earlier. Moreover, in cases where a 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted during a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30-month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the 30-month stay will not prevent approval of the 505(b)(2) application.
 
Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDAs that we submit.
 
In the NDA submissions for our product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize the commercial opportunities for these product candidates.

Combination Product Regulations
 
Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices may be regulated as “combination products” in the U.S. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories, such as drug/device, device/biologic, or drug/biologic. Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic, or device. In order to facilitate premarket review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of both components. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis.
 
We will be subject to regulations governing medical devices separate from those governing drugs. After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, however, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

• | product labeling regulations; 
--+----------------------------------


• | general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removals (e.g., recalls); 
--+----------------------------------------------


• | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | general prohibitions against the manufacture and distribution of adulterated and misbranded devices; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in civil fines, product seizures, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution of responsible individuals and us.

19

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.

20

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an approved NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Manufacturing Requirements
 
We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA’s cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, extensive records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers and certain key component suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements patients a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including untitled letters, warning letters, determinations of product adulteration, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. Such perceived problems concerning safety or efficacy may arise in the context of clinical studies continued as a result of our post-marketing obligations, reports we or FDA receive from patients and healthcare providers, or literature published by third parties regarding our products or similar products.
Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Reimbursement is expected to use standard approaches for Ophthalmology. The commercial success of PP-001 and OBG, if and when commercialized, and our other product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors at the federal, state and private levels, including U.S. Government payor programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans that have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems.   

21

We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to these initiatives and the trend toward managed healthcare and the increasing influence of managed care organizations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 
Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for PP-001 and OBG, or any other product candidate that we may develop and operate profitably.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the applicable regulatory agency will have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development, and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had fourteen full time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees. Our employees are highly skilled, and many hold advanced degrees and have experience with drug development. Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key scientific, technical and senior management personnel and our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among other benefits. We have taken proactive steps throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of our employees. We expect to continue to implement these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We may take further actions, in compliance with all appropriate government regulations, that we determine to be in the best interest of our employees.
Business Segment and Geographical Information
 
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. We view our operations and manage our business in one operating segment. We operate in one geographic segment.
