BUSINESS



Introduction



We are a Delaware blank check company incorporated on September 23, 2020 formed for the purpose of entering into an initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region although since our initial public offering, we have focused on target businesses in the nexus of media, entertainment and technology, with an emphasis on attractive targets in the digital ecosystem. Progress Acquisition Corp. has several areas of interest, such as cutting-edge media, entertainment and digital technology.
Initial Public Offering



On February 11, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 15,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $150,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 4,450,000 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $4,450,000.



On February 22, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full to purchase 2,250,000 units. On February 22, 2021, simultaneously with the closing of the underwriters’ full exercise of the over-allotment option, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 200,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor, at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $200,000.



In connection with the closing of our initial public offering on February 11, 2021 and the underwriters’ full exercise of over-allotment option on February 22, 2021, $172,500,000 of the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our initial public offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders and maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee.



We must complete our initial business combination by November 11, 2022, 21 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by November 11, 2022, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



Our Team 



Our management team has combined decades in creating, leading, and transacting with the world’s largest traditional and cutting-edge technology and media companies. Our management team consists of seasoned c-suite executives of large- scale companies, investment bankers, and portfolio managers with an extensive track record of overseeing the growth of numerous companies, implementing corporate efficiencies and identifying and managing acquisitions in the technology, media and telecom (“TMT”) markets.



Our mission is to utilize our management team’s extensive knowledge and experience in the TMT space to locate an attractive target business through their previous business interactions and extensive networks. We believe that their extensive industry knowledge drive investment opportunities to our company. In addition, we believe that our management team’s executive and board experience in the private and public sectors may help increase operational efficiencies following a business combination.

Progress Partners, an affiliate of our sponsor, has a nineteen year history of providing mergers and acquisitions services to its clients, including in connection with the sales of:




● | Adswizz, Inc., a technology provider of advertising solutions, to Pandora Media, Inc. (NYSE: P), a music and podcast discovery platform; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Signal, a provider of real-time data collection, onboarding and identity resolution, and TruSignal, a marketing technology company, to TransUnion (NYSE: TRU), a global risk and information provider; 
● | RTK.io, a provider of open-source header bidding solutions, to Rubicon Project (NYSE: RUBI), a global exchange for advertising; 
● | Magnetic Online, Inc.’s artificial intelligence platform to Deloitte Touch Tohmatsu Limited (also referred to as “Deloitte Digital”); 
● | MadPow, a design agency, to Tech Mahindra, a provider of digital transformation and consulting services and solutions; and 
● | PlumRiver LLC, an international provider of software-as-a-service technology, to Emerald Holding, Inc. (NYYSE: EEX), an operator of business-to-business trade shows. 




We believe this knowledge and experience will help us successfully consummate an initial business combination. As a result of Progress Partners’ M&A track record, members of our management team have developed long-standing relationships with a variety of management teams as well as strategic and financial sponsors. Progress Partners has deepened its M&A focus from advertising technology (“Adtech”) and marketing technology (“MarTech”) to broadly serving clients across the spectrum of media and ecommerce markets by launching Progress Ventures, which focuses on early stage investing in companies in the media, data and ecommerce sectors. We believe that we are able to leverage Progress Partners’ relationships, domain expertise and ability in the venture and M&A space to identify and execute our initial business combination.



The past performance of our management or advisory team is not a guarantee of either: (i) our ability to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination; or (ii) our ability to achieve success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. No member of our team has had management experience with special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. Historical record of our directors’ and officers’ performances should not be considered indicative of any future performance.



Target Criteria



While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or sector, we are seeking a business combination target with an enterprise value of between $250 million and $2 billion. A key acquisition criterion for our company is the reputation and track-record of the management team of our target company. An evaluation of prospective targets is based on, but not limited to, the following key criteria, depending on industry and subsector:

● | Growth. We are seeking target companies with the ability to realistically achieve growth and profitability milestones. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Working Capital. We are seeking target companies with rational working capital and growth capital needs to scale revenue and market growth. 
● | Revenue. We are seeking target companies with a demonstrated understanding of its average revenue per user (ARPU) and an articulated plan by which to grow it through existing products and a pipeline of new products. 
● | Lifetime Value of Customer. We are seeking target companies that possess a business model to deliver increasing Customer Lifetime Value where applicable as a key performance metric. 
● | Churn. We are seeking companies with declining customer churn in subscription-based business and as a key metric for public market investors. 
● | Competitive Differentiation. We are seeking target companies with clearly identifiable and articulated competitive differentiation from industry, customer and technology perspectives.

Business Strategy



We are seeking to identify target companies in our focus markets that have sustained revenue growth and a profitability profile. We evaluate industry technology, as well as growth characteristics and trends. Our team believes there are three key pillars that support our acquisition criteria as we evaluate the market:

● | Scale, Differentiation and Longevity of Pipeline. Growth is one of the key drivers of enterprise value in the world of commerce, digital media, and marketing technology. A broad client base and strong pipeline of new business prospects will help secure the future value of our investment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Global Addressability and “Stickiness”. Ensuring the scalability of our investment enables future growth and a low customer churn will support the growth. 
● | Ability to Build Upon the Core Offering into Multiple Revenue Streams. A broad list of existing technology partners not only demonstrates a flexible software architecture, but also plots out a path to derive inorganic growth through acquisition and synergistic value. 




By confirming that our target business meets the above three pillars, we believe we will increase the likelihood that it will perform successfully in the public markets, however, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some, but not all of these criteria. Specifically, we believe scale and differentiation will provide our target company with the ability to perform on a consistent basis, global addressability will provide longer term opportunity, and developing the core offering into multiple revenue streams will provide the operating margin metrics that should drive a better outcome.



Globally, consumers are transitioning their consumption of information and entertainment to a variety of digital media channels, an increasing variety of media brands and spending billions annually. Markets for software and technology platforms that support this ecosystem are rapidly scaling as they capture the increasing top-line revenue streams of high-growth markets. At the same time, the dominant paradigms of broadcast and cable entertainment, mass market commerce of big box and physical retail channels are deteriorating. Our strategy is to invest in companies that are shepherding this transition, creating new mass market platforms, or ensuring incumbent businesses adopt to digital and maintain market share.




Competitive Advantage 



Our competitive advantage and strength is based on the following:




● | Extensive Experience as Company Founders and Operators. Our management team, the investment banking team at Progress Partners and Progress Ventures have long and distinguished careers in a variety of C-Suite roles at some of the most iconic media and commerce companies in the world. These companies include Dish, Facebook, Time Inc., Gemstar, CMGI, Charter Communications, Comcast, Fox, and Excite@Home. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Extensive M&A Experience. The team at Progress Partners, has been in business servicing the needs of both buy-side and sell-side clients in the technology, digital media, eCommerce, and FinTech sectors in a variety of M&A advisory engagements. The firm has a disciplined and detailed process in identifying, conducting due diligence, negotiation deals and consummating a transaction, which we will leverage in our pursuit of an initial business combination. In addition, our management team have worked in the M&A groups for a number of top tier investment banks and private equity firms overseeing multibillion dollar transactions, including, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Merrill Lynch, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts. Additionally, many members of our team have also worked on M&A assignments as part of their C-Suite roles at Facebook, DISH, Charter and Gemstar. 






3








● | Sourcing Network. We believe our network provides us with a distinct advantage. Our network is comprised of four main components which we believe will provide a robust source of high growth acquisition opportunities in our target vertical markets. These include: 1) Progress Partners has grown over the past 19 years through its M&A advisory activities with companies including Hulu, LogMeIn, Autodesk, Visa and Nexstar. The Progress Partners team is comprised of 10 senior professionals tasked with sourcing and consummating M&A opportunities and 20 mid and junior level employees who are responsible for executing on these deals. 2) Progress Ventures 4 (PV4), is the venture capital arm of Progress Partners, anchored by Liberty Global and Sinclair Broadcasting amongst other key strategic investors. PV4 is the Progress Partner’s fourth venture fund with the first three realizing a number of exits to such acquirers as Transunion, Vista Equity Partners, GTCR LLC, a private equity firm and Deltatre, a sports and entertainment technology provider. We believe these acquirers of our previous venture portfolio companies as well as the management teams of such companies many who have founded other high growth companies will also be a source of potential acquisition targets for Progress Acquisition Corp. 3) Progress Partners maintains a list of top ten (P10) private equity, venture capital and strategic investors who we actively engage with to explore potential buyside and sell side opportunities for new and existing portfolio companies they may seek to acquire, merge or sell. We believe our multi-year relationship with these key investors will serve as another source of opportunities. 4) Executive -in-Residence (EiR) Network, is the fourth component of the Progress Partners’ sourcing network. These EiRs are all current or former C-Suite executives who have held positions at well-known media, eCommerce, data or tech related Companies with many still serving in those roles or are in the process of assuming new positions. We believe their access and knowledge of acquisition targets provide yet another competitive advantage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Transaction Structuring, Execution and Integration. Our management team as well as the investment banking team at Progress Partners, Progress Ventures and our EiR network have significant experience in formulating a variety of structures for companies across a number of industries. Much of this structuring capability is based on familiarity with the key performance indicators and growth metrics of companies in our target industries. 

Competitive Strengths



Alternative Path to Becoming Public



We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses that desires to become a publicly listed company. A merger with us will offer a target business an alternative process to a public listing rather than the traditional initial public offering process. We believe that target businesses may favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our stockholders and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management. With public company corporate governance standards, a target business may become attractive to the public investors.

Strong and Stable Financial Position with Flexibility.



With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $172,512,282, as of December 31, 2021, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us.
Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business, other than searching for a business combination, until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination which has not yet been identified. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
We Have Not Identified a Target Business



To date, we have not selected any target business on which to concentrate our search for a business combination. We have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate such companies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate a target business or that we will be able to engage in a business combination with a target business on favorable terms or at all.



Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the fair market value requirement described below, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses other than as described above. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



Sources of Target Businesses



While we have not yet selected a target business with which to consummate our initial business combination, we believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous potential candidates. Our principal means of identifying potential target businesses has been and will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, the relationships that our officers and directors have developed over their careers and their access to our sponsor’s contacts and resources generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting.





5







Our officers and directors must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis (other than EarlyBirdCapital as described elsewhere in this Report), we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, the repayment of the $300,000 loan and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.



We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential; 
● | brand recognition and potential; 
● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
● | capital requirements; 
● | competitive position; 
● | barriers to entry; 
● | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 






6








● | impact of regulation on the business; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | regulatory environment of the industry; 
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.



The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.





7







Lack of Business Diversification



We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our business combination with just one business. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described in this Report. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek stockholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until November 11, 2022 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.



None of our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock in our initial public offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to convert their shares, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.





9







Conversion Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares of Class A common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Class A common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.



Our sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of Class A or Class B common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the representative shares.



We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using DWAC System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only until November 11, 2022 to complete an initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described in this Report or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by November 11, 2022 unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, initial stockholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.



Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 21st month, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.



Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.



We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after our initial public offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.




11







We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after our 21st month and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.



Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after November 11, 2022, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described in this Report or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by November 11, 2022, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described in this Report; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by November 11, 2022, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company; 
● | in connection with the consummation of our IPO, approximately $172.5 million was placed into the trust account; 
● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 
● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the Class A common stock sold in our initial public offering on an initial business combination. 

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.





13







The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of Class A common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and 
● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent. 




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Employees



We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs and intend to continue doing so until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any period varies based on the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements



We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.



We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
