ITEM 1    BUSINESS 
The Company
MGP is one of the leading publicly traded REITs engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts, whose tenants generally offer diverse amenities including casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail offerings. 
MGP is a limited liability company that was organized in Delaware in October 2015. We conduct our operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed by MGM in January 2016 and acquired by MGP on April 25, 2016. MGP has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016.
MGP is organized in an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, which is owned by MGP, MGM, and subsidiaries of MGM, and whose sole general partner is one of MGP’s subsidiaries. MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares: Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Class B share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from the operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP but which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares. MGM holds a controlling interest in MGP through its ownership of MGP’s Class B share, but does not hold any of MGP’s Class A shares. The Class B share structure was put in place to align MGM’s voting rights in MGP with its economic interest in the Operating Partnership. MGM will no longer be entitled to the voting rights provided by the Class B share if MGM and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP and its subsidiaries) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership falls below 30%. The operating agreement provided that MGM may only transfer the Class B share (other than transfers to us and MGM’s controlled affiliates) if and to the extent that such transfer is approved by an independent conflicts committee, not to be unreasonably withheld. 
As of December 31, 2021, we generated all of our revenue by leasing our real estate properties through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership to a subsidiary of MGM pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the “MGM-MGP Master Lease”).
 As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio, including properties owned by our joint venture (“MGP BREIT Venture”), includes seven large-scale entertainment and gaming-related properties located on the Las Vegas Strip (the “Strip”): Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Park MGM, New York-New York, Luxor and Excalibur, and The Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM. Outside of Las Vegas, we also own six market-leading casino resort properties: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica, both of which are located in Mississippi, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland, and MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. We also own the casino properties of MGM Northfield Park in Northfield, Ohio and Empire City in Yonkers, New York.
Additionally, if the VICI Transaction (as defined below) does not close, we expect to grow our portfolio through acquisitions with third parties and with MGM. In pursuing external growth initiatives, we will generally seek to acquire properties that can generate stable rental revenue through long-term, triple-net leases with tenants with established operating histories, and we will consider various factors when evaluating acquisitions.
Business Developments
Empire City Transaction
On January 29, 2019, we acquired the developed real property associated with the Empire City Casino’s racetrack and casino (“Empire City”) from MGM upon its acquisition of Empire City (“Empire City Transaction”), for total consideration of approximately $634 million, consisting of the assumption of $246 million of debt by the Operating Partnership, which was repaid with borrowings under its senior secured credit facility and the issuance of 12.9 million Operating Partnership units to MGM. Empire City was added to the MGM-MGP Master Lease. As a result, the annual rent payment to MGP increased by $50 million. Consistent with the lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022 with escalators thereafter subject to an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio as described below. In addition, pursuant to the lease, MGP has a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent MGM develops additional gaming facilities and chooses to sell or transfer the property in the future.
Park MGM Transaction 
On March 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the MGM-MGP Master Lease with respect to improvements made by MGM relating to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Transaction”). In connection with the transaction, we paid total consideration of $637.5 million, of which approximately $605.6 million was paid in cash and the remainder in issuance of approximately 1.0 million of Operating Partnership units to a subsidiary of MGM. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a lease incentive asset and the MGM-MGP Master Lease annual rent payment to us increased by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022 with escalators thereafter subject to an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio as described below.
Northfield OpCo Transaction
On April 1, 2019, we transferred the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC, (“Northfield”), the entity that formerly owned the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, to a subsidiary of MGM for fair value consideration transferred of approximately $305.2 million consisting primarily of approximately 9.4 million Operating Partnership units that were ultimately redeemed by the Operating Partnership and the Company retained the real estate assets. Our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) that owned Northfield liquidated immediately prior to the transfer. Subsequently, MGM rebranded the operations it acquired (“Northfield OpCo”) to MGM Northfield Park, which was then added to the MGM-MGP Master Lease (the collective transactions, the “Northfield OpCo Transaction”). As a result, the annual rent payment to us increased by $60 million. Consistent with the lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022 with escalators thereafter subject to an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio as described below. Northfield OpCo is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the period in 2019 which we owned Northfield OpCo. Refer to Note 3 of the accompanying financial statements for additional discussion.
MGP BREIT Venture Transaction
On February 14, 2020, the Operating Partnership and MGM completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to a newly formed entity, MGP BREIT Venture, which, following the transactions, is owned 50.1% by the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”). In exchange for the contribution of the Mandalay Bay real estate assets, the Operating Partnership received consideration of $2.1 billion, which was comprised of $1.3 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGM BREIT Venture, the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in the MGP BREIT Venture, and the remainder in cash. In addition, MGM received approximately $2.4 billion of cash distributed from the MGP BREIT Venture as consideration for its contribution of the MGM Grand Las Vegas real estate assets, and, additionally, the Operating Partnership issued 2.6 million Operating Partnership units to MGM representing 5% of the equity value of MGP BREIT Venture. MGM also provides a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of the MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereto). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased 4.9 million Class A common shares of MGP for $150 million.
In connection with the transactions, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with a subsidiary of MGM for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease (the “MGP BREIT Venture Lease”) provides for a term of thirty years with two ten-year renewal options and has an initial annual base rent of $292 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first fifteen years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the consumer price index (“CPI”) increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease obligates the tenant to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures and that the tenant and MGM to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require the tenant to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding one-year period. MGM provides a guarantee of the tenant’s obligations under the lease. 
In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the MGM-MGP Master Lease was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGM-MGP Master Lease was reduced by $133 million.
Also, on January 14, 2020, the Operating Partnership, MGP, and MGM entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to MGM in connection with MGM exercising its right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem the Operating Partnership units it holds. The waiver provided that the units would be purchased at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the ten-day average closing price prior to the date of the notice of redemption. The waiver was effective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and scheduled to terminate on the earlier of February 14, 2022 or MGM receiving cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of its Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed 30.3 million of Operating Partnership units for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed 23.5 million of Operating Partnership units for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.
Operating Partnership Unit Redemption - 2021
On March 4, 2021, certain subsidiaries of MGM delivered a notice of redemption to us covering approximately 37.1 million Operating Partnership units that they held which was satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion using cash on hand together with the proceeds from the issuance of Class A shares.
VICI Transaction
On August 4, 2021, we and the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”) and MGM whereby VICI will acquire us in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will have the right to receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and MGM will have the right to receive 1.366 units of the new VICI operating partnership (“VICI OP”) in exchange for each Operating Partnership unit held by MGM. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the majority of MGM’s VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with MGM retaining approximately 12.2 million VICI OP units. MGP’s Class B share that is held by MGM will be cancelled. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was received on October 29, 2021).
MGM Springfield Transaction
On October 29, 2021, we acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from MGM for $400 million of cash consideration (such transaction, the “MGM Springfield Transaction”). MGM Springfield was added to the MGM-MGP Master Lease between us and MGM. Following the closing of the transaction, the annual rent payment under the MGM-MGP Master Lease increased by $30 million, $27.0 million of which is fixed and contractually grows at 2% per year with escalators subject to an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio discussed below. Final regulatory approvals, which were not necessary for the transaction to close, are expected to be received within nine to twelve months following the close of the transaction. Until final regulatory approvals are obtained, the parties will be subject to a trust agreement, which will provide for the property to be placed into a trust (or, at MGM’s option, be returned to MGM) during the interim period in the event that the regulator finds reasonable cause to believe that we may not be found suitable. The property will then remain in trust until a final determination regarding our suitability is made.
The Mirage Transaction
On December 13, 2021, MGM entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc (“Hard Rock”). Upon closing, the MGM-MGP Master Lease (or MGM’s master lease with VICI in the event that the VICI Transaction is consummated prior to closing) will be amended and restated to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent and a new lease will be entered into with Hard Rock to reflect an initial $90 million annual cash rent. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or termination of the VICI Transaction.
Overview of MGM 
The tenant under the MGM-MGP Master Lease is a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM, and MGM guarantees its performance and payments under the lease. MGM is a premier operator of a portfolio of well-known destination resort brands and has significant holdings in gaming, hospitality and entertainment with current ownership or operating interests in a high-quality portfolio of casino resorts.
MGM is a publicly traded company that is subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to file periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). MGM’s SEC filings are available to the public from the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. We make no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the information regarding MGM that is available through the SEC’s website or otherwise made available by MGM or any third party, and none of such information is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview of the MGM-MGP Master Lease 
The MGM-MGP Master Lease has an initial lease term of ten years beginning on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National Harbor, as described below) with the potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the tenant (with additional renewal options with respect to MGM Springfield, as described below). The lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the properties under the lease at the time of the extension. The lease provides that the 
initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on August 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial term of the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the tenant for an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether MGM elects to renew the other properties under the lease in connection with the expiration of the initial ten-year term). If, however, the tenant chooses not to renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the lease, the tenant would also lose the right to renew the lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial ten-year lease term ends in 2026. In addition to the four five-year renewal terms, the term of the lease with respect to MGM Springfield may be extended for an additional four five-year renewal terms.
The lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the tenant to pay substantially all costs associated with each property, including real estate taxes, ground lease rent, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the rent, ensuring that the cash flows associated with the lease will remain relatively predictable for the duration of its term. Additionally, the lease provides us with a right of first offer with respect to any future gaming development by MGM on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City, which we may exercise should MGM elect to sell this property in the future.
Rent under the lease consists of a “base rent” component (the “Base Rent”) and a “percentage rent” component (the “Percentage Rent”). As of December 31, 2021, the Base Rent represents approximately 91% of the annual rent amount under the lease and the Percentage Rent represents approximately 9% of the annual rent amount under the lease. The Base Rent includes a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0% for the second through the sixth lease years (as defined in the lease). Thereafter, beginning on April 1, 2022, the annual escalator of 2.0% will be subject to the tenant and, without duplication, the MGM operating subsidiary sublessees of our tenant, collectively meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio of 6.25:1.00 based on their adjusted net revenue from the leased properties subject to the lease (excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the tenant’s option, certain reimbursed costs). With respect to the additional renewal terms for MGM Springfield, for the first two additional renewal terms, Base Rent will include a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0%, subject to an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, discussed above. For each lease year subsequent to the first two additional renewal terms, the Base Rent shall be the Fair Market Rent (as defined in the MGM-MGP Master Lease) in respect of MGM Springfield. The Percentage Rent is a fixed amount for the first six lease years and will then be adjusted every five years based on the average annual adjusted net revenues of our tenant and, without duplication, the subtenants from the leased properties (calculated in accordance with the terms of the lease). The lease includes covenants that impose ongoing reporting obligations on the tenant relating to MGM’s financial statements which, in conjunction with MGM’s public disclosures to the SEC gives us insight into MGM’s financial condition on an ongoing basis. The lease also requires MGM, on a consolidated basis with the tenant, to maintain an EBITDAR to rent ratio (as described in the lease) of 1.10:1.00; provided that the tenant will not be in default of this requirement in the event there is an unavoidable delay (as such term is defined in the lease).
As of December 31, 2021, the annual rent payments under the lease for the sixth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2021, increased to $872.8 million from $827.8 million at the start of the fifth lease year, driven by the increase of $30 million for the addition of the MGM Springfield property from the lease on October 29, 2021 and the fifth 2.0% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2021.
Overview of Management and Governance
We have a dedicated, experienced management team with extensive experience in the real estate and gaming, lodging and leisure industries. This leadership team is bolstered by a board of directors that includes independent directors.
Our operating agreement provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between MGM or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by our board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to the Company if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of independent directors (which we refer to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange’s listing standards, the standards established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to the Company or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by MGM and its affiliates); provided, however, that our operating agreement provides that any transaction, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between MGM or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by MGM and its affiliates).

Competition
We compete with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, lenders, gaming companies and other investors. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.”
Environmental Matters and Potential Liabilities
Government Regulation Relating to the Environment. Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment are applicable to our properties, and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us.
Costs related to environmental compliance. As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not currently operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that are expected to have a material impact on the operations of any of our properties.
In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. 
Pursuant to the MGM-MGP Master Lease, any liability arising from or relating to environmental liabilities, or losses related to extreme weather conditions or water stress, potentially exacerbated by climate change, related to the businesses and operations located at MGM’s real property holdings prior to our initial public offering is retained by the tenant and the tenant has indemnified us (and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents and certain other related parties) against any losses arising from or relating to such environmental liabilities. There can be no assurance that the tenant will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations, or that MGM will be able to fully satisfy its obligations pursuant to its guarantee. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in receiving from the tenant or MGM any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from the tenant or MGM.
Environmental sustainability. We believe that incorporating the tenets of environmental sustainability in our business decisions advances a platform for innovation and operational efficiency. Certain assets in our portfolio, including those owned by MGP BREIT Venture, are certified to one or more third-party environmental certifications for building design, construction or operations. MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, and Gold Strike Tunica have all achieved Green Key certification. Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Park MGM, New York-New York, Luxor and Excalibur have all achieved Green Globes and Green Key certification. MGM National Harbor and The Park have Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED®) Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. MGM Springfield has portions of the property that are either LEED® Gold or LEED® Platinum certified from the U.S. Green Building Council.
Regulation
The ownership, operation, and management of gaming facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on gaming industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. In addition, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:
•ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;
•establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;
•establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;
•maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
•maintain systems for reliable record keeping;
•file periodic reports with gaming regulators;
•ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions; and
•establish programs to promote responsible gaming.
These regulations impact our business in two important ways: (1) our ownership of land and buildings in which gaming activities are operated by third party tenants pursuant to long-term leases; and (2) the operations of our gaming tenants. Many gaming and racing regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which our gaming tenants operate require MGP and its affiliates to maintain a 
license as a principal entity, entity qualifier or supplier because of its status as landlord, including Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Ohio.
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
Intellectual Property
We have a royalty-free intellectual property rights license agreement (the “IP License Agreement”) with MGM pursuant to which we will have the right to use “MGM” in the corporate names of our company and our subsidiaries without royalties for up to 50 years. Pursuant to the IP License Agreement, we will also have the right to use the “MGM” mark and the “MGM” logo in our advertising materials without royalties for up to 50 years. We are reliant on MGM to maintain and protect its intellectual property rights and we could be adversely impacted by infringement, invalidation, unauthorized use or litigation affecting the licensed intellectual property or brand names used in the operation of the properties.
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources and the amount and frequency of future distributions contain forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “likely,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “projects,” “estimates” or “anticipates” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding the closing of the VICI Transaction and any benefits we expect to receive from such transaction, the anticipated degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our results of operations, our expectations regarding our future liquidity position and the liquidity position of our tenant (and guarantor), the timing and amount of any future dividends and our ability to further grow our portfolio.
Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:
•The fact that our properties continue to face challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and emergence of variants.
•We are dependent on MGM (including its subsidiaries) unless and until we substantially diversify our portfolio, and an event that has a significant adverse effect on MGM’s business, financial position or results of operations (including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
•We depend on our properties leased to MGM for substantially all of our anticipated cash flows (including the properties held by the MGP BREIT Venture). 
•We, or the MGP BREIT Venture, as applicable, may not be able to re-lease the properties following the expiration or termination of the lease. 
•MGP’s sole material assets are Operating Partnership units representing 58.5% of the ownership interests in the Operating Partnership, as of December 31, 2021, over which we have operating control through our ownership of its general partner, and our ownership interest in the general partner of the Operating Partnership. 
•Our ability to sell our properties is restricted by the terms of the leases or may otherwise be limited. 
•We will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms. 
•Covenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
•Covenants in the debt agreements at the MGP BREIT Venture may limit its ability to pay distributions to us, which could materially affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
•Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions and distributions. 
•We are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
•Because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified. 
•Our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties (including our right of first offer with respect to any future gaming developments by MGM on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City) may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations. 
•We may face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, and our operating agreement provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption. 
•Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit future leases or transfers of our gaming properties, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties. 
•Net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time, which could negatively impact our income and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to shareholders. 
•Our dividend yield could be reduced if we were to sell any of our properties in the future. 
•There can be no assurance that we will be able to make distributions to our Operating Partnership unitholders and Class A shareholders or maintain our anticipated level of distributions over time. 
•An increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect the price of our Class A shares. 
•We are currently controlled by MGM, whose interests in our business may conflict with ours or yours. 
•We are dependent on MGM for the provision of administration services to our operations and assets. 
•MGM’s historical results may not be a reliable indicator of its future results. 
•Our operating agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our directors, officers and others. 
•If MGM engages in the same type of business we conduct, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered. 
•The MGM-MGP Master Lease and other agreements governing our relationship with MGM were not negotiated on an arm’s-length basis and the terms of those agreements may be less favorable to us than they might otherwise have been in an arm’s-length transaction. 
•In the event of a bankruptcy of the MGM-MGP Master Lease’s tenant, a bankruptcy court may determine that the MGM-MGP Master Lease is not a single lease but rather multiple severable leases, each of which can be assumed or rejected independently, in which case underperforming leases related to properties we own that are subject to the MGM-MGP Master Lease could be rejected by the tenant while tenant-favorable leases are allowed to remain in place. 
•MGM may undergo a change of control without the consent of us or of our shareholders. 
•If MGP fails to remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.
•The anticipated benefits of our prior, anticipated and future investments and acquisitions, including our investment in MGP BREIT Venture, may not be realized fully and may take longer to realize than expected.
•We may be unable to complete the VICI Transaction on the terms described herein or at all, and failure to complete the VICI Transaction may adversely affect our business and the price of our Class A shares.
•The VICI Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, which could delay or prevent the completion of the VICI Transaction.
•Potential litigation instituted against us, MGM, VICI or our respective directors challenging the VICI Transaction may prevent the VICI Transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.
•The VICI Transaction’s master transaction agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities during the pendency of the VICI Transaction.
•The announcement and pendency of the VICI Transaction may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and price of our Class A shares.
•If VICI’s anticipated debt financing for the VICI Transaction becomes unavailable, the VICI Transaction may not be completed.
•The combined company will have substantial indebtedness following the completion of the VICI Transaction, which will increase the risks related to substantial indebtedness that we currently face.
