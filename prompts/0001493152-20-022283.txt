ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 
General Development of the Business
 
In this 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, “MREIC” or “the Company”, refers to Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, together with its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
We are a corporation that qualifies as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. We were founded in 1968 and are one of the oldest public equity REITs in the world. We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a REIT, with limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under Federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code. We are subject to franchise taxes in several of the states in which we own properties.
 
In December 2017, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA), Code Section 199A was added to the Code and became effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Under the TCJA, subject to certain income limitations, an individual taxpayer and estates and trusts may deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends they receive from their taxable income. Qualified REIT dividends do not include any portion of a dividend received from a REIT that is classified as a capital gain dividend or qualified dividend income.
 
We were established in 1968 as a New Jersey Business Trust (NJBT). In 1990, the NJBT merged into a newly formed Delaware corporation. On May 15, 2003, we changed our state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland by merging with and into a Maryland corporation.
 
Description of Business
 
Our primary business is the ownership of real estate. Our investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. At September 30, 2020, we held investments in 119 properties totaling 23.4 million square feet with an overall occupancy rate of 99.4% (See Item 2 for a detailed description of the properties). As of the fiscal yearend, our weighted average lease expiration was 7.1 years, our annualized average base rent per occupied square foot was $6.36 and the weighted average building age, based on the square footage of our buildings, was 9.8 years. These properties are located in 31 states: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All of these properties are wholly-owned with the exception of two properties in New Jersey in which we own a majority interest. All of our investment properties are leased on a net basis except for an industrial park in Monaca (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania and our only non-industrial asset, which is a shopping center, located in Somerset, New Jersey.
 
The future effects of the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, however, at this time COVID-19 has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We invest in modern single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net-leases. Our investments are exclusively situated in the continental United States, and are primarily located in strategic locations that are mission-critical to our tenants’ needs. In many cases our buildings are highly automated in order to serve the omni-channel distribution networks that have become essential today. Approximately 81% of our revenue is derived from investment-grade tenants, or their subsidiaries as defined by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and by Moody’s (www.moodys.com). The references in this report to S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s are not intended to and do not include, or incorporate by reference into this report, the information of S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.

For many years, ecommerce demand has increased, and it has now become an integral part of the retail landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an even greater move towards on-line shopping. As a result of state and local government-mandated shutdowns, ecommerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales increased from approximately 15% to 27% during the last two quarters. It is estimated that ecommerce sales require three times the warehouse space relative to brick and mortar retail sales. The COVID-19 pandemic has also created a need for supply chain reconfiguration. Increased inventory stocking is currently taking place across many industries and it appears that this trend will continue in order to accommodate surges in demand. Additionally, U.S. manufacturing has been increasing in recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend as supply chains now prefer shorter distances and less reliance on foreign sources.
 
Our portfolio of modern, net-leased industrial properties, continues to provide shareholders with reliable and predictable income streams. Our resilient occupancy rates and rent collection results during these challenging times highlights the mission-critical nature of our assets and underscores the essential need for our tenants’ operations. Furthermore, because our weighted average lease maturity is 7.1 years and our weighted average fixed rate mortgage debt maturity is 11.1 years, we expect our cash flow to remain resilient over long periods of time.
 
Our overall occupancy rate and our base rent collections have remained strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our overall occupancy rate and our base rent collections during the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows:
 

Month | Occupancy | Percentage of Base Rent Collected
----------+-----------+----------------------------------
March | 99.4% | 100.0% 
April | 99.4% | 99.7% 
May | 99.4% | 99.7% 
June | 99.4% | 99.6% 
July | 99.4% | 99.6% 
August | 99.4% | 99.6% 
September | 99.4% | 99.7% 
October | 99.4% | 99.7% 
November | 99.4% | 99.9% 

 
During fiscal 2020, we purchased five industrial properties totaling 1.2 million square feet with net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 15 years resulting in a weighted average lease maturity of 13.9 years. All five properties are leased to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries, of which, 356,000 square feet, or 29%, is leased to FedEx Corporation (FDX) and FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., a subsidiary of FDX. The aggregate purchase price for the five properties was $175.1 million. These five properties are located in the following Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs): Indianapolis, IN, Columbus, OH, Greensboro, NC, Salt Lake City, UT and Oklahoma City, OK. These five properties are expected to generate annualized rental income over the life of their leases of $10.9 million. In connection with the five properties acquired during the 2020 fiscal year, we entered into one 18 year fully-amortizing mortgage loan, three 15 year fully-amortizing mortgage loans and one ten year fully-amortizing mortgage loan resulting in a weighted average term of 16.0 years. The principal amount of the five mortgage loans originally totaled $110.3 million with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 4.27%, resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 3.69%.
 
We have entered into agreements to purchase six, new build-to-suit, industrial buildings that are currently being developed in Alabama (2), Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and Vermont, totaling 2.4 million square feet. These future acquisitions have net-leased terms ranging from 10 to 20 years with a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years. The total purchase price for these six properties is $338.4 million. Four of these six properties, consisting of an aggregate of 1.2 million square feet, or 50% of the total leasable area, are leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. All six properties are leased to companies, or subsidiaries of companies, that are considered Investment Grade by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and by Moody’s (www.moodys.com). Subject to satisfactory due diligence and other customary closing conditions and requirements, we anticipate closing five of these transactions during fiscal 2021 and one during fiscal 2022. In connection with three of these six properties, we have entered into commitments to obtain three separate fully-amortizing mortgage loans totaling $139.5 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 2.62% to 3.25% with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.99%. The three loans have terms ranging from 15 to 17 years with a weighted average term of 15.8 years.

We now have several FedEx Ground parking expansion projects in progress with more under discussion. Currently there are six parking expansion projects underway and one parking expansion project recently completed subsequent to the fiscal yearend on November 5, 2020. These six projects, plus the recently completed project, are expected to cost approximately $20.1 million. These parking expansion projects will enable us to capture additional rent while lengthening the terms of these leases. We are also in discussions to expand the parking at ten additional locations bringing the total potential parking lot expansion projects to 17 currently. The parking expansion project that was completed on November 5, 2020 was at our property located in Olathe (Kansas City), KS for a total project cost of $3.4 million. The expansion resulted in a $349,000 increase in annualized rent effective November 5, 2020 increasing the annualized rent from $2,210,000 to $2,559,000.
 
We may have additional acquisitions and expansions in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, and the funds for these acquisitions may come from funds generated from operations, mortgages, draws on our unsecured line of credit facility, cash on hand, sale of marketable securities, other bank borrowings, proceeds from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), proceeds from the Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program), proceeds from the Equity Distribution Agreement (Common Stock ATM Program) and proceeds from private placements and public offerings of additional common or preferred stock or other securities. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.
 
On October 1, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.17 per share, to be paid on December 15, 2020, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2020, which represents an annualized common dividend rate of $0.68 per share. We intend to pay these distributions from cash flows from operations.
 
We have maintained or increased our common stock cash dividend for 29 consecutive years. On October 1, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.16 per share representing a 6.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. Then again, on October 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend from $0.16 per share to $0.17 per share, representing a 6.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. These two dividend raises represent a total increase of 13%.
 
Our common stock dividend policy is dependent upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, availability and cost of bank financing and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. It is our intention to continue making comparable quarterly distributions in the future and to grow our distributions over time.
 
Currently, we derive our income primarily from real estate rental operations. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue (excluding Lease Termination Income in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $-0-, $-0-, and $210,000, respectively) was $167.8 million, $154.8 million and $135.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total undepreciated assets (which is our total assets excluding accumulated depreciation) were $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
As of September 30, 2020, we had 23.4 million leasable square feet, of which 10.7 million square feet, or 46%, consisting of 62 separate stand-alone leases, were leased to FDX and its subsidiaries (5% to FDX and 41% to FDX subsidiaries). These properties are located in 26 different states. As of September 30, 2020, the 62 separate stand-alone leases that are leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries had a weighted average lease maturity of 7.9 years. As of September 30, 2020, in addition to FDX and its subsidiaries, the only other tenants that leased 5% or more of our total square footage were subsidiaries of Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), which consists of five separate stand-alone leases for properties located in four different states, containing 1.5 million total square feet, comprising 6% of our total leasable square feet. None of our properties are subject to a master lease or any cross-collateralization agreements.
 
Our Rental and Reimbursement Revenue from FDX and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, totaled $96.4 million, $93.3 million and $79.1 million, or as a percentage of total rent and reimbursement revenues, 58% (5% from FDX and 53% from FDX subsidiaries), 60% (5% from FDX and 55% from FDX subsidiaries) and 58% (5% from FDX and 53% from FDX subsidiaries). In addition to FDX and its subsidiaries, the only tenants to comprise 5% or more of our total Rental and Reimbursement Revenue were subsidiaries of Amazon, which represented 6% of our Rental and Reimbursement Revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue from subsidiaries of Amazon for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was less than 5% of our Rental and Reimbursement Revenue.

FDX and Amazon are publicly-listed companies and financial information related to these entities are available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX and Amazon are rated “BBB” and “AA-”, respectively by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and are rated “Baa2” and “A2”, respectively by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings.
 
Our weighted average lease expiration was 7.1 years and 7.6 years as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and our average annualized rent per occupied square foot as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $6.36 and $6.20, respectively. Our overall occupancy rate as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 was 99.4% and 98.9%, respectively.
 
We compete with other investors in real estate for attractive investment opportunities. These investors include other equity real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, syndications and private investors, among others. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties. We have built long-term relationships within our tenant base as well as within the merchant builder community. These relationships have historically provided us with investment opportunities that fit our investment policy.
 
The occupancy rate for US industrial real estate is currently at an all-time high of 95%. Industrial space demand has historically been very closely correlated with growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global economic recession, it has greatly accelerated the ecommerce growth trajectory. Ecommerce growth continues to be the most significant driver of the strong fundamental performance the industrial real estate sector has been experiencing. The amount of new construction for US industrial real estate has been increasing for several years as more industrial space is needed to handle direct-to-consumer distribution. It is estimated that ecommerce sales require three times the amount of warehouse space relative to brick and mortar retail sales. These new buildings are often highly automated and have much larger truck courts and parking requirements. Because modern industrial buildings are built to handle both wholesale distribution as well as direct to consumer distribution, they are known as omni-channel facilities. Excluding food, fuel, and autos, approximately 20% of total retail sales have migrated from traditional store sales to on-line sales and this growth in market share is expected to continue. For further discussion of potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see Item 1A: Risk Factors below.
 
On February 6, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (Common Stock ATM Program) with BMO Capital Markets Corp., B. Riley Securities, Inc. (formerly B. Riley FBR, Inc.), D.A. Davidson & Co., Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC (together the “Distribution Agents”) under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, having an aggregate sales price of up to $150.0 million from time to time through the Distribution Agents. Sales of the shares of Common Stock under the Agreement, if any, will be in “at the market offerings.” We implemented the Common Stock ATM program for the flexibility that it provides to opportunistically access the capital markets and to best time our equity capital needs as we close on acquisitions. To date, we have not raised any equity though our Common Stock Equity Program.
 
On June 29, 2017, we entered into a Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (formerly B. Riley FBR, Inc. or B. Riley & Co., LLC or FBR Capital Markets & Co.), that provided for the offer and sale of shares of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to $100.0 million. On August 2, 2018, we replaced this program with a new Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program that provides for the offer and sale from time to time of $125.0 million of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, representing an additional $96.5 million, with $28.5 million being carried over from the Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program entered into on June 29, 2017. On December 4, 2019, we replaced the Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program entered into on August 2, 2018 with another new Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program) that provides for the offer and sale from time to time of $125.0 million of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, representing an additional $101.0 million, with $24.0 million being carried over from the Preferred Stock At-The-Market Sales Agreement Program entered into on August 2, 2018. Sales of shares of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock under the Preferred Stock ATM Program are in “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including, without limitation, sales made directly on or through the NYSE, or on any other existing trading market for the 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, or to or through a market maker, or any other method permitted by law, including, without limitation, negotiated transactions and block trades. We began selling shares through these programs on July 3, 2017. Since inception through September 30, 2020, we sold 10.5 million shares under these programs at a weighted average price of $24.92 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $256.4 million, of which 5.0 million shares were sold during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 at a weighted average price of $25.04 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $122.4 million. As of September 30, 2020, there was $36.3 million remaining that may be sold under the Preferred Stock ATM Program.

As of September 30, 2020, 18.9 million shares of the 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.
 
Subsequent to September 30, 2020, through November 23, 2020, we sold 1.4 million shares of our 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock under our Preferred Stock ATM Program at a weighted average price of $24.92 per share, and realized net proceeds, after offering expenses, of $35.0 million.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of September 30, 2020, we had 14 full-time employees. Women represent 57% of our employees with 37.5% holding management level/leadership roles. Employees are offered great flexibility to meet personal and family needs. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct annual training to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement. Our employees, many of whom have a long tenure with the Company, frequently express satisfaction with management. Our employees are offered regular opportunities to participate in professional development programs.
Investment and Other Policies
 
Our investment policy is to concentrate our investments in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. Our strategy is to obtain a favorable yield spread between the income from the net-leased industrial properties and interest costs. In addition, we believe that investments in well-located, modern industrial properties provide a potential for long-term capital appreciation. There is the risk that, upon expiration of leases, the properties will become vacant or will be re-leased at lower rents. The results obtained from re-leasing the properties will depend on the market for industrial properties at that time.
 
In fiscal 2020, approximately 2% of our gross leasable area, representing five leases totaling 410,000 square feet, was set to expire. Four of these five leases, representing 355,000 square feet, or 87% were renewed. The four leases that renewed have a weighted average lease term of 4.2 years. These four lease renewals resulted in a U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate of $5.87 per square foot. The renewed weighted average initial cash rent per square foot is $5.71. This compares to the former weighted average rent of $5.24 per square foot on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and the former weighted average cash rent of $5.47 per square foot, resulting in an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 12.0% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the weighted average lease rate of 4.4% on a cash basis.
 
We seek to invest in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In management’s opinion, the recently acquired facilities meet these criteria. We have a concentration of properties leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries and to subsidiaries of Amazon. This is a risk that shareholders should consider. FDX and Amazon are publicly-listed companies and financial information related to these entities are available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX and Amazon are rated “BBB” and “AA-”, respectively by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and are rated “Baa2” and “A2”, respectively by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include, or incorporate by reference into this report, the information of FDX, Amazon, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.

We may issue securities for property; however, this has not occurred to date. We may repurchase or reacquire our shares from time to time if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such acquisition is in our best interest. On January 16, 2020, our Board of Directors reaffirmed our Common Stock Repurchase Program (the “Program”) that authorizes us to purchase up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchase will be determined by us at our discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Program does not have a termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at our discretion without prior notice. During March and April of fiscal 2020, we repurchased 400,000 shares of our common stock for $4.3 million at an average price of $10.69 per share. These are the only repurchases made under the Program thus far.
 
Property Management
 
With the exception of three properties, all of our 119 properties are self-managed by us.
 
We paid fees directly to local property management subagents of $482,000, $468,000 and $437,000 for fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory laws and requirements, including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act, zoning regulations, building codes and land use laws, and building, occupancy and other permit requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Additionally, local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements may restrict, or negatively impact, our property operations, or expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities and such regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities. Future changes in federal, state or local tax regulations applicable to REITs, real property or income derived from our real estate could impact the financial performance, operations, and value of our properties and the Company.
Tax Regulation
 
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year which ended September 30, 1968. Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed under the Code, as discussed below. We believe that we are organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify under the Code for taxation as a REIT since our inception, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner.
 
To maintain our qualification as a REIT, two separate percentage tests relating to the source of our gross income must be satisfied annually. First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year generally must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property, dividends paid by other REITs, mortgages on real property (including “rents from real property,” gain, and, in certain circumstances, interest) or from certain types of temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments described above, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” in satisfying the above gross income tests only if several conditions are met. First, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, amounts received or accrued generally will not be excluded from “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. Second, rents received from a tenant will not qualify as “rents from real property” if we, or a direct or indirect owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively own 10% or more of such tenant. Third, if rent attributable to personal property that is leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.” This 15% test is based on relative fair market values of the real and personal property. Generally, for rents to qualify as “rents from real property” for the purposes of the gross income tests, we are only allowed to provide services that are both “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant.” Further, for the rent paid pursuant to our leases to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. We structure our leases to generate qualifying income.

-


In addition to the income tests discussed above, to maintain our qualification as a REIT, at the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy seven tests relating to the nature of our assets. We limit our investments to assets that will allow us to meet these requirements:
 

● | At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by “real estate assets,” cash, cash items and government securities, as such terms are defined in the Code. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities, other than those in the 75% asset class. 
● | Except for certain investments in REITs, taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) and other securities in the 75% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. 
● | Except for certain investments in REITs, TRSs and other securities in the 75% asset class, we may not own more than 10% of the total voting power of any one issuer’s outstanding securities. 
● | Except for certain investments in REITs, TRSs and other securities in the 75% asset class, we may not own more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, other than securities that qualify for the debt safe harbors. 
● | The aggregate value of all securities of TRSs held by us may not exceed 20% of the value of our gross assets. 
● | No more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of debt instruments issued by “publicly offered REITs” (i.e., a REIT that is required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the extent such debt instruments are not secured by real property or interests in real property. 

 
Finally, in order to qualify as a REIT, we must, among other requirements, distribute, each year, to our shareholders at least 90 percent of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains. To the extent that we satisfy the 90 percent distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 percent of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income and may incur a 4 percent nondeductible excise tax on the amount not distributed. As a result, we distribute substantially all of our taxable income in each year, and must seek other sources of capital to fund our operations and growth.

Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Although generally our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises, in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of a tenant of such premises to satisfy any obligations with respect to such environmental liability, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, as the owner of such properties, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease.
 
From time to time, in connection with managing the properties or upon acquisition of a property, we authorize the preparation of Phase I and, when necessary, Phase II environmental reports with respect to our properties. Based upon such environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that (1) the discovery of environmental conditions, the existence or severity of which were previously unknown; (2) changes in law; (3) the conduct of tenants; or (4) activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties, will not expose us to material liability in the future.
