ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
We are one of the largest public homebuilders in the United States and have been named America's Most Trusted Homebuilder for six consecutive years (as awarded by Lifestory Research). We are also a land developer, with a portfolio of lifestyle and master-planned communities. We provide an assortment of homes across a wide range of price points to appeal to an array of consumer groups. We design, build and sell single and multi-family detached and attached homes in traditionally high growth markets for entry level, move-up, and active adult buyers. We have historically operated under the Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. During 2020, we completed the acquisition of William Lyon Homes (“WLH”), and as a result we also operate under the William Lyon Signature brand name. As part of our acquisition, we also acquired Urban Form Development, LLC (“Urban Form”), which primarily develops and constructs multi-use properties consisting of commercial space, retail, and multi-family properties. In addition, we provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding, INC (“TMHF”), title insurance and closing settlement services through our title company, Inspired Title Services, LLC (“Inspired Title”), and homeowner’s insurance policies through our insurance agency, Taylor Morrison Insurance Services, LLC (“TMIS”).
We have operations in eleven states, and our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components and a financial services component, which are managed as multiple reportable segments, as follows:

East(1) | Atlanta, Charlotte, Jacksonville, Naples, Orlando, Raleigh, Sarasota, and Tampa 
Central | Austin, Dallas, Denver, and Houston 
West | Bay Area, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento, Seattle, and Southern California 
Financial Services | Taylor Morrison Home Funding, Inspired Title Services and Taylor Morrison Insurance Services

(1)As of January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our operations in Chicago to a third party homebuilder. 
Over the last several years, we have grown organically and through multiple builder acquisitions.

•On February 6, 2020, we completed the acquisition of WLH, expanding our geographic footprint into three new states. WLH was one of the nation's largest homebuilders in the Western United States which designed, constructed, marketed and sold single-family detached and attached homes in California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Texas. 
•On October 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of AV Homes, Inc. (“AV Homes”), a homebuilder and land developer of residential communities in Florida, North and South Carolina, Arizona, and Texas.
•On January 8, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Acadia Homes, which solidified our position as a top homebuilder in Atlanta. 
•On July 21, 2015, we completed the acquisition of three divisions of Orleans Homes in markets within Charlotte, Chicago and Raleigh, all of which were new areas of operations for us.
•On April 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of JEH Homes which marked our initial entrance into the Atlanta-based markets.
Collectively, these acquisitions reflect our strategic approach in expanding our geographic footprint in order to be an industry leader. 
In recent years, we have leveraged our core homebuilding and land acquisition expertise in new ways. In July 2019, we announced an exclusive partnership with Christopher Todd Communities, a growing Phoenix-based developer of innovative, luxury rental communities, to operate a “Build-to-Rent” homebuilding business. We serve as a land acquirer, developer, and homebuilder while Christopher Todd Communities provides community design and property management consultation. We have broken ground on two communities in Phoenix and have expanded into new markets which include Austin, Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. We plan to expand into two additional markets during 2021. We anticipate the first homes will be available for rent during the latter half of 2021, and once the communities reach stabilized rental levels, we will evaluate potential exit/hold for investment strategies which will determine our long-term objective for these investments.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on national and global economies, and the United States continues to be challenged with cases. We have implemented multiple safety measures to protect our employees, customers, and trade partners. 
Despite the negative impacts of COVID-19, our leadership team created a strategic plan which allowed us to thrive under the restrictive environment. Specifically, we focused on transforming our customer experience online through innovative digital options, including (i) shifting to a remote selling environment; (ii) providing virtual options for online home tours, design center selections and new home demonstrations; and (iii) offering “curbside” or “drive thru” closings nationwide. In addition, we enhanced our website to further include a state-of-the-art customized chatbot to help provide information, engage the shopper and capture the customer, along with online appointments including home reservations that allow shoppers to reserve an inventory home online. While many of these new online products were already in process, the need for such customer convenience was expedited as a result of the pandemic.
Organizational Structure
As a result of the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”) on April 12, 2013 and a series of transactions pursuant to a Reorganization Agreement dated as of April 9, 2013, TMHC was formed and became the owner and general partner of TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership (“New TMM”), a direct subsidiary. New TMM was formed by a consortium of investors (the “Former Principal Equityholders”. From January 2017 through January 2018, we completed seven public offerings for an aggregate of 80.2 million shares of our Common Stock, using all of the net proceeds therefrom to repurchase our Former Principal Equityholders' indirect interest in TMHC. As a result of the series of offerings and repurchases, the Former Principal Equityholders ownership decreased to zero, resulting in a fully floated public company as of January 31, 2018.
On October 26, 2018, Taylor Morrison Home II Corporation, a Delaware corporation formerly known as Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (“Original Taylor Morrison”), completed a holding company reorganization (the “Reorganization”), which resulted in a new parent company (“New Taylor Morrison”) owning all of the outstanding common stock of Original Taylor Morrison. New Taylor Morrison assumed the name Taylor Morrison Home Corporation. Consequently, Original Taylor Morrison became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Taylor Morrison. In the Reorganization, Original Taylor Morrison’s stockholders became stockholders of New Taylor Morrison, on a one-for-one basis, with the same number of shares and same ownership percentage of the corresponding class of Original Taylor Morrison common stock that they held immediately prior to the holding company reorganization.
In connection with the Reorganization and the Contribution Agreement among the Company, Original Taylor Morrison and the holders of Original Taylor Morrison’s Class B common stock and paired TMM II Units party thereto (the “Paired Interest Holders”), following the consummation of the Reorganization, each Paired Interest Holder contributed its partnership units (“TMM II Units”) of TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership, the principal subsidiary of the Company and Original Taylor Morrison (“TMM II”), and paired shares of the Company’s Class B common stock to the Company in exchange, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Exchange”). As a result of the Exchange, TMM II became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. All of the Class B shares were cancelled following the Exchange. Therefore, the Company has only one class of common stock outstanding. On May 29, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Company's certificate of incorporation to (i) delete provisions no longer applicable following the cancellation of all outstanding shares of the former Class B Common Stock; and (ii) to rename the Company's Class A common stock as “Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share.” Following this amendment and restatement, under the Company's certificate of incorporation, its authorized capital stock consists of 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share. References to “Common Stock” refer to the Class A common stock for dates prior to June 10, 2019.
In addition, in connection with the Reorganization, all assets remaining in our Canadian subsidiary were contributed to a subsidiary in the United States (“Canada Unwind”). As a result, the previously unrecognized accumulated other comprehensive loss on foreign currency translation was recognized. In addition, we recognized non-resident Canadian withholding taxes. Excluding taxes, all costs associated with the corporate reorganization and Canada Unwind are presented as a component of transaction and corporate reorganization expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.

For periods from and after October 26, 2018: New Taylor Morrison (as defined above) and its subsidiaries.
New Taylor Morrison, as the successor issuer to Original Taylor Morrison, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, began making filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act on October 26, 2018.
The business, executive officers and directors of New Taylor Morrison immediately following the Reorganization were identical to the business, executive officers and directors of Original Taylor Morrison immediately prior to the Reorganization.

Business Strategy
Table of Contents

We have short and long-term priorities and strategies which are built on the following pillars:
Short-term priorities 
•streamlining our processes to build operational effectiveness, including our recent acquisitions;
•expanding our land infrastructure to benefit operations in the future;
•continuing to enhance the customer experience; and 
•expanding the Build-to-Rent operations. 
Long-term strategies
•opportunistic land acquisition of prime assets in core locations;
•building distinctive communities driven by consumer preferences;
•maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and
•appropriately balancing price with pace in the sale of our homes.
Our short-term priorities were established to enhance and refine our current operations. As a result of all of our acquisitions over the years, we have focused on integrating multiple companies together, and now we believe we are well positioned to implement processes and procedures throughout our organization which will provide efficiency and ultimately, operational effectiveness. 
Land infrastructure has always been a long-term strategy for our business, and we believe we have been successful in locating and purchasing land in desirable locations which offer strong returns. Our short-term priority ensures that we continue to maintain a strong focus. In addition, through the acquisition of WLH and through our own organic growth, we have and will continue to take advantage of joint venture opportunities as they arise in order to secure prime assets, share risk and maximize returns.
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to enhance our website and customer experience at a faster rate than we initially planned; however, such changes have proven to not only be needed, but welcomed by our customers. Our sales and marketing teams are committed to positioning Taylor Morrison to be the industry leader in customer experience.
Since the announcement of our entry into the rental space in 2019 with Build-to-Rent, we have focused on identifying key locations and markets to successfully launch the operations. As we anticipate the first rentals to be available later in 2021, we are evaluating the initial results to allow for us to make any necessary changes or enhancements as we roll-out in other markets.
Our long-term strategies continue to serve us well. We maintain our commitment to building authentic homes and communities that inspire and enhance the lives of our customers. Delivering on this commitment requires thoughtful design and research to accommodate the needs of our various customers and the surrounding community. The Taylor Morrison difference begins by providing our customers with homes that are both conducive to their lifestyles and built to last, prioritizing our commitment for the long-term satisfaction of our homeowners. Our communities are generally “lifestyle” communities in core locations, which have various distinguishing attributes, including proximity to job centers, attractive school systems and a variety of local amenities in well-regarded submarkets.
Our dedication to service defines our customer experience and acknowledges homeowners’ suggestions to incorporate style, quality and sustainability into every community we develop. We offer a range of award-winning and innovative designs with a number of features such as single-story, multi-story, multi-family, higher density living, ranch style living, split bedroom plans and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to diverse buyer needs. We engage architectural firms and internal architectural resources to develop and augment existing plans in order to ensure that our homes reflect current and local consumer tastes. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency and cost savings to reduce the impact on the environment. We rolled out a LiveWell program during 2020 which provides homeowners with a robust suite of healthy home features and technologies focused on providing healthier air, cleaner water, and safer paint. We serve all segments and generational groups through our quality products which attract entry-level, move-up, and active adult buyers. 
We acquire our land assets in core locations, focusing on the preferences of our buyers, building desirable communities, continually evaluating and analyzing overhead efficiency and optimizing profit by managing volume. In addition, we seek to maximize long-term shareholder value and operate our business to capitalize on market dynamics and mitigate risks from economic downturns as we recognize the cyclical nature of the housing industry. We regularly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder return. This strategy is built on four primary pillars - reinvest in core homebuilding operations, 
Table of Contents

seek additional growth opportunities through mergers and acquisitions, optimize debt leverage, and reinvest in ancillary business opportunities within the industry. 
We believe our land positioning and pipeline have positioned us for strategic growth and increased profitability in the housing market. We execute this strategy by:
•Optimizing our existing land supply through enhanced product offerings;
•Combining land acquisition and development expertise with homebuilding operations;
•Focusing product offerings on specific customer groups;
•Building aspirational homes for our customers and focusing on superior customer service;
•Maintaining an efficient capital structure;
•Selectively pursuing acquisitions; and
•Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record.
Land and Development Strategies
Community development includes the acquisition and development of land, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. We generally operate as community developers, but in some communities we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case we acquire fully entitled and developed lots. 
In order to maximize our risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Our portfolio investment committee of senior executives meets on a regular basis. Annually, our operating divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographies. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Supply and demand are analyzed on a consumer segment and submarket basis to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary. Strategic decisions regarding community positioning are included in the decision making and underwriting process and are made in consultation with senior executives of our management team. 
Through our acquisition of WLH, we are party to various land banking arrangements which allow us to acquire land in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and retaining cash. These third-party entities use equity contributions from their owners and/or incur debt to finance the acquisition and development of the land. Such lots are included in our controlled lots for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our land portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized below:

Raw land represents property that has not been developed and remains in its natural state. Partially developed represents land where the grading and horizontal development process has begun. Finished lots represent those lots which we have purchased from third parties in addition to lots for which we have completed the horizontal development process and are ready for the vertical or homebuilding construction. Long-term strategic assets are those lots where we are currently not performing any development. Controlled lots represent lots in which we have a contractual right, generally through an option contract or land banking arrangement, to an underlying real estate asset.
In the land purchasing and/or consideration of joint ventures, specific projects of interest are typically identified and placed under contract by the local teams. Such teams carry out a robust due diligence and feasibility process evaluating key factors which include, but are not limited to, environmental concerns, estimated budgets for development and home construction, anticipated product segmentation, competitive environment, ownership structure, and financial returns. Findings are summarized and presented to our portfolio investment committee for review. Certain portfolio opportunities will often be sourced centrally and managed at the corporate level. We also determine whether continued spending on currently owned and controlled land is a well-timed and appropriate use of capital. Our portfolio investment strategy emphasizes expected profitability to reflect the risk and timing of returns, and the level of sales volume in new and existing markets.
The following is a summary of the book value of our land positions:

Homes in Inventory
We manage our inventory of homes under construction by selectively commencing construction to capture new home demand, while monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes. 
The following is a summary of units in inventory by homebuilding reporting segment as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

(1)We expect that by the end of 2021 we will deliver substantially all sold homes in backlog at December 31, 2020. 
Community Development
We create a complete development concept for each community, beginning with an overall community layout and then determine the size, style and price range of the homes, the layout of the streets and positioning of the individual home sites. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we improve the land by clearing and grading, installing roads, underground utility lines, staking out individual home sites and, in certain communities, building distinctive entrance structures and recreational amenities.
Each community has employees who perform superintendent, sales and customer service functions, in conjunction with a local management team to manage the overall project.
The life cycle of a community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of land, continuing through the land development phase, and concluding with the sale, construction, and delivery of homes. Actual life cycle will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as developed lots.
The construction time for our homes varies from project to project depending on geographic region, the time of year, the size and complexity of construction, the governmental approval processes, local labor availability, availability of materials and supplies, weather, and other factors. On average, we complete the construction of a typical home in approximately six months.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct a home. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a few supply chain disruptions with delays from certain national vendors on specific items and certain vendors in certain locations; however, such delays did not generally slow down or prevent our home closings schedule.
Trade Labor
Our construction, land and purchasing teams coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We are a general contractor for all of our homebuilding projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices can be challenging in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry 
Table of Contents

growth and other economic factors that affect the number of people in the workforce. We have also been challenged by limitations on the number of tradespeople permitted at construction sites as a result of social distancing measures.
Procurement and Construction
We have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and national presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize cost and process efficiencies on local, regional and national levels and to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements.
The regional and national vendor programs currently involve over 60 vendors and include highly reputable and well-established companies that supply us with lumber, appliances, HVAC systems, insulation, roofing, paint and lighting, among other materials. Through these relationships, we are able to realize savings on the costs of essential materials. Contracts are typically structured to include a blend of attractive upfront pricing and rebates and, in some cases, advantageous retroactive pricing in instances of contract renewals. In addition to cost advantages, these arrangements also help minimize the risk of construction delays during supply shortages, as we are often able to leverage our size to obtain our full allocation of required materials.
Warranty Program
All of our divisions currently offer a one-year limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, a two-year limited warranty on certain systems (such as electrical or cooling systems), and a ten-year limited warranty on structural defects. In addition, we honor any outstanding warranties related to our acquired companies. Any covered item will be repaired or replaced to conform to approximately the original quality standards of the home at the time of closing. We also currently provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration (“VA”) regulations. From time to time, we evaluate our warranty offerings, including third-party warranty coverage, taking into account market changes and regulatory requirements. 
Sales and Marketing 
We are committed to continuously enhancing our customer experience, including how we target and attract our consumers. Our marketing program calls for a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our corporate sales and marketing team provides a centralized marketing framework across our regional operations as well as sales training to our local teams. Our divisional marketing teams utilize corporate supplied messaging that is localized for relevance to our consumer groups in each market. Our advertising and digital media strategy is managed centrally but allows for division variance by size of division, cost of media, inventory count, number of community openings, seasonality, and a variety of other factors. 
Our goal is to identify the preferences of our customers and demographic groups and offer them innovative, well-designed homes that are efficient and profitable to build. We strive to maintain product and price level differentiation through continual market and customer research. We target a balance of regional market portfolios across a variety of demographics. We also use key indicators of market specific supply and demand characteristics to determine preferences of our customer base and to perform an optimal matching of consumer groups, product and community design, and specific location.
The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.taylormorrison.com (none of the information on or accessible through this website is a part of this Annual Report). We introduced a full redesign of our website during the fourth quarter of 2019 based on a comprehensive analysis that was completed in 2018. The main purpose of our website is to attract and inform potential customers and to showcase our product offerings and unique brand position. The website offers the ability for customers to evaluate floor plans, elevations, square footage, community amenities and geographic location. 
In 2020, we introduced a full suite of new online tools to further enhance our online customer experience. While many of these new online products were already contemplated in our digital roadmap, the global pandemic and spread of COVID-19 accelerated our implementation. These tools include 1) a state-of-the-art customized chatbot to help provide information, engage the shopper and capture the lead; 2) online appointments to help customers schedule an appointment with ease and speed; 3) self-guided tours to allow customers to tour our inventory homes privately, safely and outside of normal business hours; and 4) online home reservations that allow shoppers to reserve an inventory home online. These tools have proved to be instrumental to our online/virtual sales success in 2020 and beyond. Customers may also use the website to make inquiries and to receive a prompt response from one of our “Internet Home Consultants.” This platform was centralized in 2020, providing coverage for all divisions seven days a week—improving our customers' experience and developing consistency across the 
Table of Contents

country. The website is fully integrated with our customer relationship management ("CRM") and lead scoring system. By analyzing the content of the CRM, we are able to focus our lead generation programs to deliver high-quality sales leads. With these leads we are better able to increase sale conversion rates and lower marketing costs. We believe the digital marketing strategy for our websites, which is continually reviewed and refined, provides high return on our investments. 
On the heels of a successful brand positioning and awareness campaign in 2019, in 2020, we launched a national brand campaign aimed at consumers in the discovery phase. The objective of this campaign is to further raise brand awareness and to position Taylor Morrison as an industry leader. 
We selectively utilize traditional advertising such as print, directional marketing, newspapers, billboards and radio at the local level. We also directly notify local real estate agents and firms of any new community openings in order to use the existing real estate agent/broker channels in each market. Pricing for our homes is evaluated weekly based on an analysis of market conditions, competitive environment and supply and demand characteristics.
We use furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate the advantages of the designs, features and functionality of our homes and to enhance visitor experience. We generally employ or contract with interior and landscape designers who create attractive model homes that highlight the features and options available for the homes within our communities. Depending upon the number of homes to be built in the project and the product lines to be offered, we generally build between one and three model homes for each active selling community.
Our homes are sold by our commissioned team members who work from sales offices generally located within our model homes. During the pandemic, we employed many virtual tools and safety precautions so that home shoppers could safely view our model homes and communities. Our goal is to ensure our sales force has extensive knowledge of our homes, including our energy efficient features, sales strategies, mortgage options and community dynamics. To achieve this goal, we have on-going training for our sales team and conduct regular meetings to keep them abreast of the latest promotions, options and sales techniques and discuss geographic competition. Our sales team members are licensed real estate agents where required by law and assist our customers in adding design features to their homes, which we believe appeal to local consumer preferences. Third-party brokers who sell our homes are generally paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. In some of our divisions, we contract with third-party design studios that specialize in assisting our homebuyers with options and upgrades to personalize their homes. Utilizing these third-party design studios allows us to manage our overhead and costs more efficiently. We may also offer various sales incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades. The use, types and amount of incentives depends largely on existing economic and local competitive market conditions.
Competition
The homebuilding business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with the sale of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure or for investment. Numerous homebuilders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of location, design, quality, service, value and reputation.
In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal. We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. We may have a varying amount of homes under construction, home closings, revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter. Our results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:
•the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects;
•the timing of sales;
•the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels;
•the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction;
•the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate;

•mix of homes closed;
•construction timetables;
•the cost and availability of materials and labor; and
•weather conditions in the markets in which we build.
As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position are not necessarily representative of a full fiscal year. To illustrate the seasonality in net homes sold, homes closed and home closings revenue, a summary of the quarterly financial data follows:

 | Three Months Ended, | | | Three Months Ended,
 | 2020 | | | 2019 
 | March 31 | | June 30 | | September 30 | December 31 | | March 31 | | June 30 | September 30 | | December 31
Net homes sold | 23 | % | | 23 | % | 29 | % | 25 | % | | 25 | % | | 27 | % | 24 | % | 24 | %
Home closings revenue | 22 | % | | 25 | % | 28 | % | 25 | % | | 19 | % | | 27 | % | 23 | % | 31 | %
Income before income taxes(1) | (9) | % | | 26 | % | 46 | % | 37 | % | | 21 | % | | 34 | % | 28 | % | 17 | %
Net income(1) | (12) | % | | 27 | % | 46 | % | 39 | % | | 20 | % | | 32 | % | 26 | % | 22 | %

(1)2020 includes the impacts of one-time costs relating to the acquisition of WLH. The three months ended March 31, 2020 was materially impacted by such costs as the acquisition was completed during that quarter. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. 
Financial Services
TMHF provides a number of finance-related services to our customers through our mortgage lending operations. The strategic purpose of TMHF is:
•to utilize mortgage finance as a sales tool in the home sale process to ensure a consistent customer experience and assist in maintaining home production efficiency; and
•to control and analyze our sales order backlog quality and to manage projected home closing and delivery dates for our customers.
TMHF operates as an independent mortgage banker and conducts its business as a FHA Full Eagle lender. TMHF funds mortgage loans utilizing warehouse credit facilities. Revenue is earned through origination and processing fees combined with service release premiums earned in the secondary market once the loans are sold to investors. Typically, loans are sold and servicing is released within 15-20 business days.
TMHF competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. TMHF utilizes a multi-investor correspondent platform which gives us increased flexibility when placing loans to meet our customers’ needs. TMHF has continued to expand and strengthen our correspondent relationships. This has created stability and consistency in our origination process and delivery. 
Inspired Title operates as a title insurance agent providing title and escrow services. Inspired Title searches and examines land title records, prepares title commitments and polices for homebuyers in our Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas markets, contracting with agents in other markets that Inspired Title does not provide escrow service (currently title insurance underwriters and attorneys) to perform the escrow closing functions. Inspired Title competes against other title underwriters and title/escrow agents that provide similar services. 
TMIS operates as an insurance agency utilizing third-party carriers that specialize in homeowner’s insurance for new homes for homebuyers in all of our markets. TMIS competes against other insurance agencies that provide similar services.
Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Regulatory
Table of Contents

We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as natural space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has increased our overall costs, and may delay the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.
TMHF is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators.
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state. Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.
Environmental
We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, “environmental laws”). For example, environmental laws may affect: how we manage stormwater runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental characteristics of the site and its present and former uses. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocation, and other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage, or other losses. 
We manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance from the corporate and regional legal departments. As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties. To date, environmental site assessments conducted at our properties have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity or results of operations, nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns.
Health and Safety
Table of Contents

We are committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites. We have a health and safety audit system that includes comprehensive twice-yearly independent third-party inspections of selected sites covering all aspects of health and safety. Key areas of focus are on site conditions meeting exacting health and safety standards, and on subcontractor performance throughout our operating areas meeting or exceeding expectations. All of our team members must complete an assigned curriculum of online safety courses each year. These courses vary according to job responsibility. In addition, groups such as construction and field personnel are required to attend additional health and safety related training programs. As a result of the COVID-19 virus, we have taken additional health and safety precautions which are described below in Human Capital Resources.
Information Technology
We have a centralized information technology organization with its core team located at our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, augmented with field support technicians in key locations across the U.S. Our approach to information technology is to continuously simplify our information technology platform and consolidate and standardize applications. We believe a common application platform enables the sharing of ideas and rapid implementation of process improvements and best practices across the entire company. Our back-office operations use a fully integrated, industry recognized enterprise resource planning package. Marketing and field sales utilize a leading CRM solution that tracks leads and prospects from all sources and manages the customer communication process from lead creation through the buying process and beyond the post-warranty period. Field operations teams collaborate with our supply chain management to schedule and manage development and construction projects with a set of standard and widely used homebuilding industry solutions.
Intellectual Property
We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,700 full-time equivalent persons. Of these, approximately 2,300 were engaged in corporate and homebuilding operations, and the remaining approximately 400 were engaged in financial services. As of December 31, 2020, we were not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are supervised by our project managers and field superintendents who manage third party subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for some architectural, engineering, advertising and legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
The people who work for our company are our most valuable resources and are critical to our continued success and execution of our strategies. Our People Services team focuses on attracting, promoting and retaining qualified employees with the expertise needed to manage and support our operations. Our top division and regional leaders average nearly seven years of tenure with us. In addition, our executive leadership who are responsible for setting our overall strategy average approximately 12 years with us, and many of them have worked their entire careers in the homebuilding industry. 
To attract and retain top talent in our industry, we offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits and highly competitive compensation packages. Our employees are eligible for medical, dental and vision insurance, a savings/retirement plan, life and disability insurance, various wellness programs and tuition reimbursement, along with other optional benefits designed to meet individual needs. We engage third party compensation and benefits consulting firms to evaluate our programs and benchmark them against our peers.
We believe in recognizing and promoting future leaders from within our organization and making diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) an ongoing important priority. We provide courses which focus on adherence to company policies on DEI, and our leadership team hosts town hall meetings within the organization to ensure employees have a voice, awareness, and commitment to DEI. Our leadership team is committed to creating a collaborative and inclusive work environment and continues to develop initiatives, policies and procedures to foster greater DEI. At December 31, 2020, our workforce consisted of approximately 46% females and of these 19% were in managerial roles. The Company has and will continue to demonstrate that there is an open door and a path to leadership for all team members at any level of our company. Accordingly, we are proud to have been included for the third consecutive year as one of only 380 companies, and the only U.S. homebuilder, on the 2021 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), fostering greater transparency and an inclusive work environment in a traditionally male-dominated industry.

The safety of our employees, customers, and third party vendors is one of management’s top priorities. Upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our leadership team created a COVID Task Force which continues to meet regularly to discuss, among other things, recent infection and related trends and the latest Center for Disease Control recommendations. The Task Force determines the appropriate protocols and procedures to maintain health and safety within the organization and with our customers and trade partners. A few of the safety guidelines we implemented throughout our organization include the following:
•Appointment-only, escorted-tours of model homes. We have also performed numerous virtual tours for those customers who prefer to stay in their own home. 
•Cleaning all high-touch surfaces multiple times a day. 
•All public drink and snack stations in our model homes, division, and corporate offices were suspended and replaced with single-serving, sealed products. 
•All warranty and customer service inquiries include a questionnaire to assess the urgency of the issue and the health of the customer and dispatched trade partners. 
•Customers are contacted prior to a design center appointment and asked general health screening questions. In addition, they are offered a virtual appointment instead of in-person. 
All of our locations were operating as of December 31, 2020 within applicable local, state, and national guidelines and mandates.
