Item 1.Business
Overview
AeroClean Technologies, Inc. (the “Company,” “AeroClean Technologies,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is an interior space air purification technology company. Our immediate objective is to continue implementing the full-scale commercialization of our high-performance interior air sterilization and disinfection products for the eradication of harmful airborne pathogens, including COVID-19 (a respiratory disease stemming from a novel coronavirus, the outbreak of which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020).
We incorporate our proprietary, patented UV-C LED technology in equipment and devices to protect the occupants of interior spaces. These spaces include hospital and non-hospital healthcare facilities (such as outpatient chemotherapy and other infusion facilities and senior living centers and nursing homes), schools and universities, commercial properties and other indoor spaces.
Our products are being designed and engineered to exceed the rigorous standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for interior air sterilization and disinfection products. Our units can be marketed for use pursuant to the FDA Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (the “Policy”).
We are currently seeking premarket approval from the FDA (“510(k) clearance”) for the use of our products in healthcare and other markets for which product performance is required to be validated by certified independent labs. Regulatory clearances and independent certifications serve as important product imprimaturs that also influence decision-making by non-healthcare market equipment purchasers. We expect to receive FDA 510(k) clearance for Pūrgo in the second half of 2022.
In July 2021, we completed the development stage of our first device, the Pūrgo room air purification unit, including design and independent testing and certification, as well as the scale-up of manufacturing, and began commercial production and sales. Pūrgo’s launch also marks the debut of our go-to-market strategy for SteriDuct, the Company’s patented air purification technology. We intend to incorporate SteriDuct into a broad line of autonomous air treatment devices. In February 2022, we debuted a prototype of Pūrgo Lift, our air purification solution for elevators and other wall-mount applications, and since then certain of our customers are testing and evaluating Pūrgo Lift for future deployment in their facilities.
To support the transition to commercial operations, in July 2021, we also completed the build out of our corporate headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which includes our warehouse and distribution facility, as well as the site for our future service operations.
As part of our business strategy we continually evaluate a wide array of strategic opportunities, including the acquisition, disposition or licensing of intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions. We may seek to acquire technologies, product lines and companies which operate in businesses similar to our own or which are ancillary, complementary or adjacent to our own or in which we do not currently operate. Such businesses could operate in the air purification space or more generally in the health and wellness space or in other industries. We could also seek to merge with or into another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another company. We could also seek to merge with or into another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another company. In connection with these activities we may enter into non-binding letters of intent as we assess the commercial appeal of potential strategic transactions. Any transactions that we enter into could be material to our business, financial condition and operating results. Please see related risks described under the captions “We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval” in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.

Background and Purpose
We were established by our co-founders, Amin J. Khoury, PhD (Hon), our Chairman; David Helfet, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer; and Mark Krosney, our Chief Scientific Officer, to fulfill their determination to provide solutions for the critical challenges posed by harmful airborne pathogens and resultant hospital acquired infections (“HAIs”).
HAIs and other infections acquired in outpatient treatment facilities present an extreme risk to the immunocompromised patient population. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated that 10 million people are immunocompromised. Whether in hospitals or infusion treatment locations, patients with cancer, and a multitude of other disease and disease related treatments, are at an elevated risk of infection. Constant air purification is of extreme benefit in these settings in order to minimize the presence of dangerous airborne pathogens due to the often catastrophic risk that infection poses to the immunocompromised patient population. It is estimated that there are approximately 2 million HAIs annually in the United States, causing approximately 100,000 deaths and costing over $30 billion. These numbers are in-hospital only and do not include the likely much larger number of patients infected in outpatient infusion and treatment centers. For one example, there are more than 650,000 cancer patients that receive outpatient chemotherapy, and they are at risk for acquiring infections in these treatment facilities, despite advanced filtration and ventilation systems. 60,000 cancer patients are hospitalized annually for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and infections - one patient dies every two hours from this complication.
The onset of COVID-19 has increased our urgency to create innovative and more effective air purification solutions for the risks posed by harmful airborne pathogens, including coronavirus and other viruses, bacteria, molds, particles, fungi and allergens. Studies have shown 85% of COVID-19 transmission to be airborne person-to-person in the form of aerosolized droplets and in enclosed spaces. The Journal of Science estimates the annual U.S. cost of flu and respiratory infections at $50 billion and the World Health Organization estimates that 4 million premature deaths annually are caused by air pollution.
The genesis of our proprietary air purification technology traces back to efforts to address commercial aircraft cabin air quality. Mr. Krosney is a highly-accomplished scientist who is primarily responsible for numerous patents, several of which are important components of our IP portfolio. Mr. Krosney is a former senior scientist and engineer at B/E Aerospace. Dr. Khoury, the founder and long-time Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of B/E Aerospace, envisioned the significant potential to apply such proprietary technology for revolutionary, medical-grade air purification solutions for hospital and other critical healthcare settings. Dr. Khoury consulted with Dr. David Helfet, a leading orthopedic surgeon at both the Hospital for Special Surgery and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, regarding possible solutions for the critical challenges to patients and hospitals posed by harmful airborne pathogens and HAIs.
This collaboration has served as the foundation for our Company and the implementation of our business plan. Dr. Khoury made a substantial investment in the Company, leading an investment group providing the necessary capital to develop the Company’s substantial intellectual property portfolio and products.
Dr. Khoury is a renowned industrialist recognized for bringing to market game-changing solutions for diverse challenges and for building market-leading global businesses. Dr. Khoury was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of B/E Aerospace, a Nasdaq-listed S&P 400 diversified industrial company, sold in April 2017 to Rockwell Collins (now, part of Raytheon) for $8.6 billion. Previously, in December 2014, B/E Aerospace completed the spin-off of KLX Inc. as an independent Nasdaq-listed public company, itself sold in May 2018 to Boeing for $4.25 billion. Drs. Khoury and Helfet were long-time colleagues who served together for many years on the board of directors of Synthes, Inc., which, led by Dr. Khoury’s efforts, completed a $21 billion merger in 2012, creating DePuy Synthes, Johnson & Johnson’s global orthopaedics business.
Several other members of our leadership team have long-standing working relationships with Dr. Khoury, including in senior-level roles at B/E Aerospace and KLX Inc.

The Global Air Purification Market and our Patented SteriDuct Technology
The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired intensive analysis of how pathogens are transmitted among humans and has isolated the role of airborne transmission as being among the most significant risks. While each pathogen is unique, deadly viruses proliferate and are transmitted between humans principally through the air, and then can also settle on surfaces and may remain contagious for extended periods of time depending upon the pathology. The application of ultraviolet (“UV”) light to both the air and to surfaces has emerged as the most efficacious way to thoroughly eradicate pathogens without the use of chemicals, drugs or solvents, which may leave residues or have other deleterious implications for humans who come in contact after treatment. Most importantly, the UV-LED light embedded in our patented SteriDuct technology treats air continuously, to contain the spread of pathogens in any enclosed space where they are being continuously transmitted by an infected person. A sanitized room is no longer free from cross infection the moment an infected person enters it; and that person will continue to spread pathogens through the air for the duration of their presence, only mitigated by the ability of an in-room air purification system to destroy pathogens while they are being emitted.
The global air purification market for 2021 was estimated by industry sources at over $13.0 billion. We believe the emerging realization that pathogens introduced locally to a room will likely infect other occupants before the central building conditioning and filtering system can treat the air has led to a focus on continuous air treatment at the room level rather than at the building level. In addition, while historically air filtration has been predominantly focused on removing dust, spores, allergens and pathogens from air streams to maintain the efficiency (both energy and air quality) of large HVAC systems, we believe there is increasing focus on the ability to drive continuous, real-time pathogen elimination as part of the air filtration process. This includes the elimination of minute particles, including organic compounds, molds, bio-aerosols, bacteria and viruses.
We believe the large majority of air purification products are built for the consumer market and only use air filtration as a way to filter — not eradicate — airborne pollutants. Many feature high-efficiency particulate air (“HEPA”) and “HEPA like” filter material, which is designed to trap 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns. Viruses are much smaller than 0.3 microns, and studies show that viruses and drug-resistant bacteria can penetrate HEPA filters. As particle load builds-up and filters become “dirty,” tunneling can occur allowing previously captured particulate and pathogens to break through filter material — increasing the probability of recontamination and infection in indoor spaces. We believe our patented UV-C LED SteriDuct technology augments HEPA filtration to not only filter pathogens but to kill them, and to do so continuously and effectively.
We expect that our patented UV-C LED SteriDuct technology, which has been developed over the past seven years, is adaptable to applications addressing major points of potential contamination in interior spaces. While originally developed principally to reduce the number of HAIs and to protect immunocompromised patients, we have completed the development phase of the first commercial application of our technology just at the moment in history where we believe we can have a seminal impact on people’s lives across society. We believe AeroClean Technologies can capture an expansive market opportunity by installing our patented devices in hospitals, outpatient treatment facilities, commercial offices, residential buildings, universities and schools, senior living and nursing homes, non-hospital healthcare facilities and human transport and travel industries, providing the Company with both initial sales revenue at attractive margins and a steady stream of aftermarket services revenues related to sales of replacement filters and recurring maintenance at attractive levels of profitability.
Through application and implementation of our UV-C LED technology, the Pūrgo and Pūrgo Lift devices have the potential to create comprehensive solutions for at-risk enclosed spaces.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, we launched the first commercial application of our technology with a lightweight (approximately 42 pounds) portable device, Pūrgo, that continuously purifies the air, and we have begun the manufacturing process to support this rollout. We have additional air purification applications also in development.
Our History
The genesis of our SteriDuct and Pūrgo technology traces back to technology developed by Mark Krosney, Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, a highly-accomplished scientist and formerly one of the lead engineers of B/E Aerospace. The technology was originally intended to address commercial aircraft cabin air quality applications. However, Amin J. Khoury, the Founder and formerly the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of B/E Aerospace, recognized the commercial potential of this technology for the healthcare market, after discussions with Dr. David Helfet, Co-Founder and the Director Emeritus of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at both the Hospital for Special Surgery and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, regarding the critical challenge to patients and hospitals posed

by HAIs. Dr. Khoury subsequently led an “angel” investment group in funding the Company to-date, in particular to provide for rigorous design and development of Pūrgo in a manner conforming to demanding regulatory requirements and the development of substantial intellectual property.
Dr. Khoury and Dr. Helfet are long-time colleagues who developed a strong business relationship during their respective 26- and 10-year service on the board of directors of Synthes, Inc., a $4 billion annual revenue company and the world’s leading manufacturer and marketer of orthopedic trauma implants. In 2011, Dr. Khoury, at the request of Hansjörg Wyss, Chief Executive Officer of Synthes, led an effort to sell Synthes. In 2012, Synthes successfully merged with Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy franchise in a $21 billion transaction.
To date, our team has been formed through the utilization of highly qualified independent contractors and executives, including scientists, engineers, sales and marketing resources and others with expertise in electrical, mechanical and software engineering, computer science and regulatory matters, as well as experience in the healthcare and medical device industries. We have used consultants and other contract personnel for product development and engineering projects as well as for outsourced manufacturing to leverage industry and subject matter experts as well as to manage the Company’s fixed cost structure.
We believe the team AeroClean Technologies has assembled, in addition to its differentiated technology and product offering, positions the Company to establish itself as the category leader and industry consolidator in premium air purification solutions for rooms, elevators and transportation systems.
Dr. Khoury and his team, with an established track record and experience from B/E Aerospace in penetrating and ultimately becoming the industry leader for a comprehensive array of commercial aircraft cabin interior components in the face of multiple incumbent competitors, informs AeroClean Technologies’ approach to the air purification market, which we believe is currently populated by a number of small companies with technology that relies predominantly on traditional filtration devices.
Leveraging Engineering, Manufacturing and Regulatory Expertise
In developing our patents and related intellectual property into commercial devices that will meet the exacting standards of medical device regulators, while at the same time creating a competitive advantage in our target markets, AeroClean Technologies has chosen to partner with leading companies with both engineering and FDA regulatory expertise as well as FDA regulated contract manufacturers. Utilization of the leading companies in their fields has allowed AeroClean Technologies to dramatically shorten the time-to-market of our Pūrgo device (our first marketable device), while also taking advantage of best-in-class engineering, regulatory expertise and assembly of our first commercial units without having to invest the substantial sums that would be required to establish all these capabilities in-house. The exacting standards embedded in our Pūrgo device are expected to deliver market leading performance in air purification with true competitive differentiation and which we expect will support anticipated final FDA 510(k) clearance for utilization in healthcare and other target markets where performance must be validated by certified independent laboratories.
Our in-house team, leveraging these organizations, has developed what we believe to be the lightest weight, most compact, powerful and cost-effective pathogen elimination device for our target markets.
AeroClean Technologies contracted with IPS, a leading medical and technology device engineering group, in developing the device configuration, which would optimize the performance and reliability of our patented UV-LED and SteriDuct technology. With over 100 designers and engineers who specialize in commercializing highly exacting applications of new technology, a dedicated IPS team has worked continuously with us to design, develop, test and source the components for the commercial production of the Pūrgo device. This is particularly true of electronics design and software engineering as well as product industrial design. To manufacture our first Pūrgo device, AeroClean Technologies has engaged Mack Molding, a leading contract manufacturer of medical devices, which also has experience manufacturing devices for the transportation, energy/environment, defense/aerospace and consumer markets. AeroClean Technologies has also engaged MethodSense to reduce time to market and move our Pūrgo device successfully through the FDA regulatory process. MethodSense is a global medical device consultancy and software developer with over 21 years of deep industry experience, proven processes and modern technology focused on the commercial success of medical device companies.
Our Value Proposition
While there are numerous air filtration devices currently on the market, in addition to traditional filters fitted on HVAC systems primarily in hospitals, we believe the Pūrgo devices promise a step-change improvement in air treatment. By employing our patented

UV-C LED and SteriDuct technology combined with three-stage filtration, our devices not only remove dust, spores, allergens and pathogens from the air but also eradicate essentially all types of airborne pathogens in occupied room airspaces and do so continuously. The cost of upgrading HVAC systems in hospitals, schools, office buildings, commercial spaces and others looking for air quality solutions can not only be costly, but it can also be disruptive as the core system is retrofitted or construction takes place to address high-risk areas throughout the building.
Further, HVAC systems do not always run continuously and cannot, in any event, continuously protect a room’s occupants as compared to Pūrgo, which is continuously running and placed closely to potential sources of cross-infection. Larger plug-and-play solutions are generally more costly and, we believe, less effective because they cannot always be placed closest to the occupants we are protecting. Our first Pūrgo device is of a size and price point that allows customers to strategically place units for optimal protection of occupants. We believe the combination of technology, performance and price of the Pūrgo devices will deliver a singular value proposition that will make AeroClean Technologies a disruptor and consolidator in the professional air treatment market.
Our Technological Advantage
The foundation of our patented pathogen-killing technology is the utilization of solid-state light-emitting diodes (“LEDs”) and the unique way we have deployed this LED technology through the development of our patented SteriDuct technology, which incorporates a proprietary geometry and reflective coating air induction and treatment process to safely deliver superior pathogen killing capability, while operating at lower power levels and with minimal air flow disruption. Our technology uses UV-emitting LEDs, which replaces conventional vacuum tube UV sources used in other competing UV devices — which are harmful to human beings and the environment and emit poisonous mercury gas when broken.
Studies of COVID-19 transmission have highlighted that, similar to seasonal flu viruses and other pathogens (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or “SARS,” and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or “MERS”), COVID-19 is transmitted predominantly through contact between an infected person and others. To effectively limit this exposure, the air in the room that the infected person occupies must be continuously treated to remove the pathogens being transmitted into the air in the room. There currently are a number of commercial devices that reduce air pathogen levels, but they do not do so continuously while the room is occupied. The Pūrgo device operates continuously, and the devices are able to be placed strategically within occupied rooms to treat the infected air closer to the source of the infectious material, rather than have the air pulled from the room through traditional filtering systems. Testing results confirmed that our device, powered by SteriDuct, was able to eradicate 99.99% (“4 Log”) of airborne pathogens in less than 60 minutes, including a surrogate pathogen for COVID-19.

The Pūrgo air filtration machine is a compact, lightweight, powerful, energy efficient device that we believe delivers best-in-class performance. The LEDs used in Pūrgo produce UV output at precisely the wavelength to maximize pathogen killing, 265 nanometers. Our utilization of LEDs reflects the advances in LED technology that have made LEDs superior to UV vacuum tube bulbs in terms of energy efficiency, superior air flow dynamics and safety. The cost of LEDs has come down by a factor of ten on a per watt basis over the past decade, while the effective operational life has also grown by ten, and output power has increased by a factor of seven. By

contrast, UV vacuum tubes are an old technology, which cannot be operated in the presence of human beings and for which we believe significant performance improvements have been infrequent and have had less impact. LEDs also meet current environmental best practices, as they have no toxic materials such as mercury, which are prevalent in conventional UV lamps.
We developed our patented SteriDuct operating system to optimize the application of state-of-the-art UV-C LEDs in several pathogen killing configurations. Optical analysis tools such as ray tracing, combined with mathematical modeling, allows us to geometrically locate the LEDs in the exact spot in SteriDuct to maximize light intensity. Further, material scientific developments have enabled us to utilize alenod material in the coating of SteriDuct, which triples the pathogen killing irradiance of SteriDuct, and computational fluid dynamics were applied in the positioning of the LEDs to optimize air flow and minimize air pressure loss, thereby reducing fan and motor requirements to circulate air, which reduces size, weight and cost while achieving 4 Log average kill rates (99.99%) against viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. To validate and prove the pathogen killing power of SteriDuct, we have completed extensive microbial testing in Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) compliant, independent laboratories.
Since the design architecture of the pathogen killing SteriDuct has an efficient high air flow and a low pressure loss profile, the design is flexible and can be incorporated into many applications. Implementation of our SteriDuct technology into the Pūrgo devices incorporates both a sophisticated filtration system that reduces particles, odors, organic solvents, bacteria, viruses, allergen and mold, as well as our patented UV-C LED based pathogen killing system. SteriDuct may also be used in large spaces such as lecture halls and auditoriums. SteriDuct purification devices can be deployed at the HVAC discharge grille or at the central air handler. This implementation would not require additional fans in the air handler due to the low-pressure characteristics of SteriDuct. We expect that similar configurations can be developed for airplanes and buses.
Our Target Markets
We believe our technology is adaptable and superior in the treatment of air and destruction of pathogens in any interior space. The market for our technology, therefore, is both large and global in nature—we estimate the total addressable market opportunity just within the U.S. healthcare market to be approximately $12 billion. Our proprietary patents and the validation of our first device, the compact, lightweight, powerful and cost-effective Pūrgo air purification device, will be important in establishing our brand and commercial footprint.
The markets we intend to focus on initially will be predominantly in the healthcare industry, as the inspiration for our technology was to address the high rate of HAIs acquired throughout hospitals, but particularly in surgeries and outpatient treatment areas with the highest population of immunocompromised patients. Moreover, the healthcare industry in the U.S. represents an approximately $12 billion market opportunity that will continue to be on the front lines of dealing with pathogens and, therefore, we expect will be receptive to technological advances that address the issue. We are acutely focused on the breadth of healthcare facilities that would benefit from utilization of the Pūrgo and Pūrgo Lift devices, as well as our SteriDuct technology. In the U.S. alone, there are 6,090 hospitals, which have 208,500 on-site surgical facilities. In addition, these hospitals have 106,000 intensive care beds, predominantly each in their own room, and 825,000 non-ICU beds, usually configured with three beds per room. We have also assumed each hospital has 15 waiting rooms across both the general admittance and specialty practices within the facility and that each hospital has a minimum of seven elevators. As a result, in total, we estimate the approximate total market opportunity for the Pūrgo device within the U.S. hospital system to be $2.4 billion. For example, our largest customer in 2021, which made up 45% of revenues, was a hospital with a broad deployment of 100 units to address a variety of clinical and non-clinical spaces. While these individual customers may be significant, and customers may purchase units over time to satisfy their needs, the transactional nature of the opportunities and the size of the addressable market mitigate a risk of concentration on an ongoing basis.
We believe the non-hospital medical market presents an equally compelling opportunity. There are approximately 209,000 medical offices in the U.S., as well as 9,280 non-hospital surgery centers containing 16,000 procedure rooms. We believe that most rooms could utilize a minimum of two Pūrgo devices to optimize room sanitization and disinfection, representing a market opportunity of approximately $4.3 billion.
Our third expected healthcare market opportunity is serving the long-term care and assisted living industry. We view this market as a natural extension of the first two areas, hospital and medical offices, which we will address in the first phase of our commercial launch. There are currently 60,000 long-term care and assisted living facilities in the U.S., and we believe, from a safety and fiduciary position, each facility should consider coverage of the common facilities, including dining rooms, activity rooms, therapy rooms and, importantly, reception areas and elevators, representing a market opportunity of approximately $5.1 billion, exclusive of elevators.

We believe adoption of the Pūrgo device in the healthcare environment will create substantial credibility and momentum that will provide us an opportunity to enter the university and K-12 school market. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, the American Rescue Plan, which included $130 billion to help schools reopen safely by reducing the probability of cross-infection — including for personal protective equipment, reducing class sizes and, importantly, improving ventilation. In a 2021 report on K-12 public school infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers found that more than 40% of schools had HVAC systems in need of repair. Therefore, we believe that the K-12 school market represents a market opportunity of approximately $1 billion. We are engaging in activities with a goal of accessing the K-12 school market, including direct marketing to school administrators online and working with third-parties that specialize in marketing to K-12 schools. While our primary focus in 2021 has been establishing our commercial footprint within the healthcare markets as previously noted, we expect to see word-of-mouth driven demand from universities and schools as the year progresses. We estimate the total addressable market opportunity within the U.S. education and childcare markets (public and private K-12 schools, universities and colleges, preschool and daycare) to be approximately $9.7 billion.
Similarly, we believe emerging public awareness of the realities of airborne infections are focusing both tenants and landlords on the inadequacies of centralized HVAC systems for protecting occupants in individual rooms, in the instance when an infected person is also in the room and contagious. Only localized, continuous sanitizing of the air can reduce the risk of infection in these circumstances. We believe prophylactic placement of the Pūrgo devices in conference rooms, open work environments, cafeterias, lobbies and other communal spaces will substantially improve the air quality of these areas well beyond what is provided by central HVAC systems and thereby make it safe to return to and remain at work in multi-story office buildings. We estimate the total addressable market opportunity within the U.S. for elevator air purification to be approximately $5.0 billion.
Commercialization Plan
As mentioned above, we launched the first commercial application of our technology with the Pūrgo air purification device in July 2021 and have begun the manufacturing start up process to support this rollout. Our founding investors have invested approximately $15 million to date to support our technology conceptualization, product design, prototyping, testing and pre-product launch expenses. We have engaged Mack Molding, an FDA-regulated subsidiary of the privately held Mack Group, to manufacture our first Pūrgo device. Mack Molding is a leading contract manufacturer of medical devices, with a focused team of product development, program management, quality, regulatory, document control and purchasing staff that are skilled in medical device manufacturing.
We have sold the Pūrgo air purification device principally to hospitals, outpatient facilities and medical offices in multi-unit transactions to optimize both our sales productivity and our ability to provide efficient aftermarket service to our proprietary devices. We have begun the process of hiring a dedicated sales team to support our targeted sales efforts. We are also exploring exclusive distribution arrangements with several potential distribution and service partners, both domestically and internationally, which could help accelerate the market penetration of our devices more rapidly than on a purely organic basis.
We launched the Pūrgo device into the multi-billion dollar Florida healthcare market initially, focusing principally on protection of immunocompromised patients in chemotherapy and other outpatient infusion centers, general, specialty and eye surgery-centers and medical offices. We believe the Florida medical market is both extensive and representative of the larger healthcare opportunity across the U.S. and that penetrating this market will allow us to scale up our operations at the same time from our corporate offices in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. We intend to grow our sales organization ahead of demand to take advantage of the learning curve afforded by our sales in Florida.
At the same time as we are marketing our room air purification device, we intend to accelerate our development of complementary devices that will address other points of pathogen vulnerability within the work and travel markets. Our highest priority in this regard is our elevator air purification device, Pūrgo Lift. We believe the tight enclosure of elevators is a “hot spot” for pathogen transmission that will be crucial for every high rise building to address in re-opening safely. This is particularly true in hospitals, where sick, vulnerable patients and visitors are regularly together on lifts. We developed working prototypes of the Pūrgo Lift device for beta testing and market feedback by the end of 2021, and we expect one of our customers to begin trialing the device in one of its public elevators during the first half of 2022 to evaluate for future deployment across the customer’s facilities.

10



The commercial aviation market is also at a critical stage, with safe travel contingent on the ability to move passengers safely through airport waiting and boarding areas and to treat cabin air in-flight and to disinfect aircraft cabins between flights. Our SteriDuct technology was first developed by one of the former lead engineers of B/E Aerospace, a world leader in cabin interiors, including oxygen systems, and in its current form is adaptable to this application.
Similar to the commercial aviation market, we believe the large building HVAC market will provide substantial retrofit opportunities, as the current large systems generally rely on filtration systems that do not effectively remove and destroy pathogens flowing through the system. We intend to enter into discussions with the leading global HVAC suppliers, as well as directly with building owners, to develop retrofit applications for our SteriDuct technology that will complement existing installed systems in these large buildings.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our technology, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection, protecting our know-how and trade secrets, successfully defending any patents against third-party challenges and, where relevant, collaborating with third party licensors to obtain licenses to use relevant technology.
Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We have been issued four patents in the U.S. We also have a number of other patent applications pending in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. Our patent portfolio includes patents relating to our UV-C LED SteriDuct technology, which is incorporated into our Pūrgo and Pūrgo Lift products.
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we file in the future, nor can we be sure that any existing patents or any patents that may be granted in the future upon which we rely will be commercially useful in protecting our products or processes. See the risks described under the captions “Our success may depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property” and “We may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, which would be expensive, and if unsuccessful, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights” in the section of this Annual Report titled “Risk Factors.”
Competition
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and will continue to increase, the global focus on clean air. We experience competition from organizations such as large, diverse companies with extensive product development and manufacturing, as well as smaller specialized companies, that have developed and are attempting to develop air filtration and purification systems. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages over other organizations. For example, we believe that competitive products to the Pūrgo device in the “medical grade” niche are expensive, cumbersome and have a limited effective life.
Additionally, many of our competitors are promoting technologies that are not proven, do not have enough scientific data and are potentially harmful. Importantly, our Pūrgo technology meets or exceeds each of the air purifiers guidelines and recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Protection Agency and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.
Our competitors may develop and commercialize products and technologies that compete with our products and technologies. Organizations that compete with us may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to: (i) provide broader services and product lines; (ii) make greater investments in research and development; (iii) carry on larger research and development initiatives; (iv) undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; and (v) adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. They also may have greater name recognition and better access to customers than we do. We also expect to continue to face competition from alternative technologies. Our technology and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by advances in existing technological approaches or products or the development of different approaches or products by one or more of our competitors. See the risk described under the caption “We face intense competition” in the section of this Annual Report titled “Risk Factors.”

Governmental Regulations
Our products are being designed and engineered to exceed the rigorous standards set by the FDA for Class II medical devices used for interior air sterilization and disinfection products. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, our devices are permitted to be marketed for use pursuant to and for the duration of the FDA Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency, referred to as the “Policy” throughout this Annual Report. The Policy is only intended to remain in effect for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19. In December 2021, the FDA issued the draft Transition Plan for Medical Devices That Fall Within Enforcement Policies Issued During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (the “draft Transition Plan,” and the related transition plan once finalized, the “final Transition Plan”) for public comment which, among other things, proposes a 180-day transition period beginning on an undetermined implementation date and ending on the date that the Policy is withdrawn, at which time we will need to be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The draft Transition Plan provides that companies relying on the Policy, among other COVID-related FDA guidance, must submit and obtain acceptance of their 510(k) submissions prior to the expiration of the transition period in order to continue marketing and distributing devices following withdrawal of the Policy. The final Transition Plan ultimately published by the FDA may deviate, potentially significantly, from the draft Transition Plan and it is therefore impossible to know exactly how the final Transition Plan will impact our business and regulatory compliance requirements. See the risk described under the caption “We do not yet have full FDA clearance to market our products in the United States” in the section of this Annual Report titled “Risk Factors.”
We submitted our 510(k) application for Pūrgo in November 2021. We will be subject to continuing FDA regulation if and when we receive 510(k) clearance for Pūrgo, which is expected to be obtained in the second half of 2022, as well as by other federal and state authorities.
The FDA regulates the development, design, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, clearance, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”).
After an air purification product is cleared for marketing as a medical device, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

● | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements that manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clearance of a new 510(k) premarket notification for modifications to 510(k) cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of the device;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA information that reasonably suggests a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | complying with the federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations if the FDA finds that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The manufacturing processes related to our devices are required to comply with applicable regulations covering the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distributions, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. Regulations also require, among other things, maintenance of a device master record, device history file and complaint files. As a manufacturer, Mack Molding’s facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Mack Molding’s failure to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shutdown of, or restrictions on, its manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with our devices could result in restrictions on the device, including the inability to market the device for its intended use or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls, withdrawals or administrative detention or seizure of our devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
