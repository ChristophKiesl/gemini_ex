Overview
 
COVID-19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products and services. Several public health organizations have recommended, and many local governments have implemented, certain measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including shelter in place and social distancing ordinances, which has resulted in a significant deterioration of economic conditions in many of the countries in which we operate.
 
The impact of COVID-19 and the related disruptions caused to the global economy and our business did not have a material adverse impact on our business during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, COVID-19 had a significant impact on the global economy, including accelerating the shift to cloud computing and driving a sharp increase in demand for bandwidth.  Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the spread of the COVID-19 virus caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing work-from-home policies and restricting travel by our employees.  We also took certain actions in response to the pandemic, which are set forth above in “Note Regarding COVID-19.”
 
Looking forward, we believe that our business will continue to be favorably impacted by the increased demand for bandwidth caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, given the dynamic nature of COVID-19, we have considered its impact when developing our estimates and assumptions. Actual results and outcomes may differ from our estimates and assumptions.  Additionally, while the impact of the pandemic may increase demand for our products either in the short-term or in the long-term, it may also adversely affect our ability to meet that demand, as measures taken in response to the pandemic may affect the operations of our suppliers and customers, as their own workforces are disrupted.  As a result, our supply chain may be interrupted and we may experience delays in the delivery of our product.  The impact of the pandemic on the global economy and on our business, as well as on the business of our suppliers and customers, and the additional measures that may be needed in the future in response to it, will depend on many factors beyond our control and knowledge.  We will monitor the situation to determine what actions may be necessary or appropriate to address the impact of the pandemic, which may include actions mandated or recommended by federal, state or local authorities.

We provide 25G to 600G high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for the communications market. 


  In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of eSilicon Corporation (“eSilicon”) for approximately $214.6 million.  A portion of the consideration has been placed in an escrow fund for up to 12 months (or up to 36 months in certain circumstances) following the closing for the satisfaction of certain indemnification obligations.  We acquired eSilicon to accelerate our roadmap in developing electro-optics solutions for cloud and telecommunications customers.   


In May 2020, we purchased certain assets and rights of Arrive Technologies, Inc. ("Arrive") for approximately $20.1 million.  A portion of the consideration was withheld for 12 months following the closing for the satisfaction of certain potential indemnification claims.  We acquired Arrive for the expansion of our presence into strategic geographic regions for talent acquisition.
 
In April 2020, we issued $506.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 in a private placement.  We also repurchased some of our Convertible Notes 2015 and Convertible Notes 2016 during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
  We leverage our proprietary high-speed analog and mixed signal processing expertise and our deep understanding of system architectures to address data bottlenecks in current and emerging communications, enterprise network, computing and storage architectures. We develop these solutions as a result of our competitive strengths, including our system-level simulation capabilities, analog design expertise, strong relationships with industry leaders, extensive broad process technology experience and high-speed package modeling and design expertise. We use our core technology and strength in high-speed analog design to enable our customers to deploy next generation communications systems that operate with high performance at high-speed. We believe we are at the forefront of developing semiconductor solutions that deliver up to multi-Terabit speeds throughout the network infrastructure, including core, metro and the cloud. 


We have ongoing, informal collaborative discussions with industry and technology leaders in Tier-1 cloud providers, telecom operators, network system original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and optical module and component vendors to design architectures and products that solve bandwidth bottlenecks in existing and next generation communications systems. Although we generally do not have any formal collaboration agreements with these entities, we often engage in informal discussions with these entities with respect to anticipated technological challenges, next generation customer requirements and industry conventions and standards. We help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders, OEMs systems manufacturers and standards bodies. Our products are designed into systems sold by OEMs, including Tier-1 OEMs in the telecom and networking system markets worldwide. We believe we are one of a limited number of suppliers to these OEMs for the type of products we sell, and in some cases we may be the sole supplier for certain applications. We sell both directly to these OEMs and to other intermediary systems or module manufacturers that, in turn, sell to these OEMs.
 
Pending Merger with Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (“Marvell”)
 
On October 29, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Marvell Technology Group Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company (“Marvell”), Maui HoldCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marvell (“HoldCo”), Maui Acquisition Company Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo (“Bermuda Merger Sub”), and Indigo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo (“Delaware Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Bermuda Merger Sub will merge with and into Marvell, with Marvell surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo (the “Bermuda Merger”), followed immediately by the merger of Delaware Merger Sub with and into Inphi, with Inphi surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo (the “Delaware Merger” and, together with the Bermuda Merger, the “Mergers”).  The Mergers will result in a combined company domiciled in the United States, with Marvell shareholders owning approximately 83% of the combined company, and our stockholders owning approximately 17% of the combined company.
 
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions described therein, (i) at the effective time of the Bermuda Merger, all issued and outstanding common shares of Marvell (other than shares held by Marvell in Marvell’s treasury or held by HoldCo, Bermuda Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Marvell) will be automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of HoldCo (“HoldCo Common Stock”) and (ii) at the effective time of the Delaware Merger, all outstanding shares of our common stock (other than (x) shares held by us (or held in our treasury) or held by Marvell, Delaware Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Marvell or held, directly or indirectly, by any of our subsidiaries or (y) shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn under Delaware law) will be automatically converted into the right to receive 2.323 shares of HoldCo Common Stock and $66.0 in cash per share, without interest, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of HoldCo Common Stock. 


The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Marvell and us relating to their and our respective businesses and public filings, in each case generally subject to a materiality and “Material Adverse Effect” qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of us, including a covenant to conduct its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and in accordance with past practice and to refrain from taking certain actions without Marvell’s consent. We have agreed not to solicit proposals, provide information to third parties, or enter into discussions, relating to alternative transaction proposals, or recommend or enter into agreements relating to certain specified alternative transactions, subject, to certain exceptions that would permit us to consider and recommend certain superior proposals if the failure to do so would be inconsistent with our board of directors’ fiduciary duties, or to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept certain superior proposals if the failure to do so would be inconsistent with our board of directors fiduciary duties.
 
  Consummation of the Mergers is subject to various conditions, including, among others, (a) adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders; (b) the approval of the Bermuda Merger by Marvell’s shareholders; (c) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC by HoldCo in connection with the issuance of HoldCo Common Stock in the Mergers; (d) the approval of the listing of HoldCo Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; and (e) the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and certain other regulatory clearances. The obligation of each party to consummate the Mergers is also conditioned upon the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions), the other party having performed in all material respects its covenants and obligations under the Merger Agreement and the absence of a “Material Adverse Effect” on the other party (as defined in the Merger Agreement). 


The Merger Agreement also provides the parties with rights to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, including if the Mergers have not been consummated by June 29, 2021 (which may be extended up to March 1, 2022 in order to satisfy certain regulatory closing conditions), if either party fails to obtain the necessary approvals for the Mergers from its stockholders, or if there is an order permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting either Merger.
 
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, an alternative acquisition proposal had previously been made with respect to us, and within 12 months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement for certain extraordinary corporate transactions or completes any such transaction, we would be obligated to pay Marvell a fee equal to $300.0 million. We would also be obligated to pay this fee if the Merger Agreement is terminated because of certain triggering events by us, including our board of directors changing or withdrawing its recommendation regarding the Mergers, or failing to reaffirm its’ support for the Mergers in certain circumstances. Additionally, we would be obligated to pay this fee if we elect to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into certain superior acquisition transactions.
 
  If the Merger Agreement is terminated because of certain triggering events by Marvell, including Marvell’s board of directors changing or withdrawing its recommendation regarding the Mergers, or failing to reaffirm its support for the Mergers in certain circumstances, Marvell would be obligated to pay us a fee equal to $400.0 million. Marvell would also be obligated to pay this fee if it elects to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into certain superior acquisition transactions.

Our Business 
 
Our semiconductor solutions leverage our deep understanding of high-speed analog and mixed signal processing and our system architecture knowledge to address data bottlenecks in current and emerging network and cloud architectures. We design and develop our products for the communications and computing markets, which typically have two to three year design cycles, and product life cycles of five or more years. We believe our leadership position in developing high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductors is a result of the following core strengths:

• | System-Level Simulation Capabilities. We design our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions to be critical components in complex systems. In order to understand and solve system problems, we work closely with systems vendors to develop proprietary component, channel and system simulation models. We use these proprietary simulation and validation tools to accurately predict system performance prior to fabricating the semiconductor or alternatively, to identify and optimize critical semiconductor parameters to satisfy customer system requirements. We use these simulation and validation capabilities to reduce our customers’ time to market and engineering investments, thus enabling us to establish differentiated design relationships with our customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analog Design Expertise. We believe that we are a leader in developing broadband analog and mixed signal semiconductors operating at high frequencies of up to 100 GHz. High-speed analog circuit design is extremely challenging because, as frequencies increase, semiconductors are increasingly sensitive to temperature, power supply noise, process variation and interaction with neighboring circuit elements. Development of components that work robustly at high frequencies requires an understanding of analog circuit design, including electromagnetic theory and practical experience in implementation and testing. Our analog design expertise has enabled us to design and commercially ship several first in the world technologies including the first 100G linear transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and the first 400G linear modulator driver that is deployed in volume globally in telecommunications networking infrastructures. We launched the world’s first 50/100/200/400G/800G 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4) interconnect ICs for cloud interconnects. The chipset solution included multiple variants of the PAM4 PHY IC based on a highly adaptable and scalable InphiNityCore™ digital signal processing (DSP) engine and the OmniConnect™ transmitter for copper and optics media along with a companion linear TIA for Nx50G PAM4 interfaces.

• | Silicon Photonics Design Expertise. We have developed deep expertise in Silicon photonics (Sipho) and successfully commercialized the world first 100G dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) Sipho-based solutions that consumes as little as 4.5W of power versus alternate solutions at 25W. This Sipho-based solution has been deployed in high volume at a Tier-1 cloud vendor and continues to gain market acceptance at Tier-1 OEMs for the enterprise and internet exchange customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DSP Design Expertise. Our DSP algorithm engineers and digital designers are experts on low-power and low-latency DSP designs for equalization, estimation, clock recovery, carrier recovery, forward error correction, and coded modulation enabling the highest performance PAM4 and higher-order-modulation serdes, optical interconnects, and coherent modems. Our low-power and low-latency DSP application-specific integrated circuit provides a critical advantage for small-form factor pluggable modules, on board optics, in package optics or any other highly integrated electrical or electro-optical communication systems for high speed data center interconnect and fiber optic telecom networks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Relationships with Industry Leaders. We develop many of our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for applications and systems that are driven by industry leaders in the communications and cloud markets. Through our established relationships with industry leaders, we have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to address their technological challenges. As a result, we are designed into several of their current systems and believe we are well-positioned to develop high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for their emerging architectures. We have ongoing, informal or formal collaborative discussions with communication, networking companies, and cloud companies in Tier-1 cloud providers, telecom operators, network system OEMs and optical module and component vendors to address their next generation 100G and beyond 100G efforts. Specifically, we engage in informal discussions with these entities with respect to anticipated technological challenges, next generation customer requirements and industry conventions and standards. As a result of our development efforts with industry leaders, we help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders, OEMs and systems manufacturers, as well as standards bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) to establish industry standards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Process Technology. We employ process technology experts, device technologists and circuit designers who have extensive experience in many process technologies including CMOS, SiGe, Silicon photonics (Sipho) and III-V technologies such as gallium arsenide or indium phosphide. We have developed specific internal models and design kits for each process to support a uniform design methodology across all of our semiconductor solutions. For example, our products using 16 nanometer CMOS technology require development of accurate models for sub-circuits such as integrated phase lock loops, varactors and inductors. In addition, for Sipho and III-V materials-based processes, in-house model development is a necessity and we believe also provides a substantial competitive advantage because these processes have complex material and device interactions. Combined with our fabless manufacturing strategy, our design expertise, proprietary model libraries and uniform design methodology allow us to use the best possible materials and substrates to design and develop our semiconductor solutions. We believe that our ability to design high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductors in a wide range of materials and process technologies allows us to provide superior performance, power, cost and reliability for a specific set of market requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High-Speed Package Modeling and Design. We have developed deep expertise in high-speed package modeling and design, since introducing the first high-speed 50 GHz MUX and DEMUX product in 2001. At high frequencies, the interaction between an analog device, its package and the external environment can significantly affect product performance. Accurately modeling and developing advanced packaging allows semiconductor solutions to address this challenge. Due to the advanced nature of this work, there is a limited supply of engineers with experience in high-speed package modeling and design, and therefore, this required expertise can be difficult to acquire for companies that have not invested in developing such a skill set. We have developed an infrastructure to simulate electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of devices and packages that we integrate within our semiconductor design process and implement at our third-party packaging providers. Modeling is an inherently iterative process, and since our model libraries are used extensively by our circuit designers, the accuracy and value of these models increases over time. Our current packaging and modeling techniques enable us to deliver semiconductors that are energy efficient, offer high-speed processing and enable advanced signal integrity, all in a small footprint.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our system-level simulation capabilities, our analog design and broad process technology design capabilities as well as our strengths in packaging enable us to differentiate ourselves by delivering advanced high-speed analog and mixed signal processing solutions. For example, we believe we are the first vendor who has successfully commercialized DSP base 100G Ethernet PHYs running PAM4 standard CMOS process.

We believe the key benefits that our solutions provide to our customers are as follows:
 

• | High Performance. Our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions are designed to meet the specific technical requirements of our customers in their respective end markets. In many cases, our close design relationships and deep engineering expertise put us in a position where we are one of a limited group of semiconductor vendors that can provide the necessary solution. For instance, in the broadband communications market, we believe our products achieve the highest signal integrity and attain superior signal transmission distance at required error-free or low error rates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low Power and Small Footprint. In each of the end markets that we serve, the power budget of the overall system is a key consideration for systems designers. Power consumption greatly impacts system operation cost, footprint and cooling requirements, and is increasingly becoming a point of focus for our customers. We believe that our high-speed analog and mixed signal processing solutions enable our customers to implement system architectures that reduce overall system power consumption. We also believe that, at high frequencies, our high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor devices typically consume less power than competitors’ standard designs, which often incorporate power-consuming digital signal processing to perform data transfer functions, thereby further reducing overall system power consumption. In addition, in many of our applications, we are able to design and deliver semiconductors that have a smaller footprint and therefore reduce the overall system size.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Faster Time to Market. Our customers compete in markets that require high-speed, reliable semiconductors that can be integrated into their systems as soon as new market opportunities develop. To meet our customers’ time-to-market requirements, we work closely with them early in their design cycles and are actively involved in their development processes. Over the past ten years, we have developed methodologies and simulation environments that accurately predict the behavior of complex integrated circuits within various communications systems. In addition, we have developed an extensive internal library of proven building block circuits such as amplifiers, phase frequency detectors and transmitters that are reused to shorten design cycles and reduce risk.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers 
 
We sell our products directly to OEMs and indirectly to OEMs through module manufacturers, cloud providers, original design manufacturers (ODMs) and sub-systems providers. We work closely with technology leaders to design architectures and products that help solve bandwidth bottlenecks in and between systems. These technology leaders often design our products into reference designs, which they provide to their customers and suppliers. In the networking market, we work closely with OEMs to deliver high performance communication links. These OEMs design our products into their systems and then require their ODM and electronics manufacturing services suppliers to purchase and use that specific product from us. We also work directly with optical module manufacturers to design our products into their modules, which they sell to OEMs.
 
We work closely with our customers throughout design cycles that often last two to three years and we are able to develop long-term relationships with them as our technology becomes embedded in their products. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to not only be designed into their current systems, but also to continually develop next generation high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for their future products. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold our products to approximately 140 customers.
 
Sales to customers in Asia accounted for 69%, 64% and 57% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Because many of our customers or their OEM manufacturers are located in Asia, we anticipate that a majority of our future revenue will continue to come from sales to that region. Although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in Asia, we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold to end-users outside of Asia.
 
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe that sales to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) and Innolight Technology (Suzhou) Ltd. (Innolight), directly and indirectly, through subcontractors, accounted for approximately 12% and 14% of our total revenue, respectively, and that our 10 largest direct customers collectively accounted for approximately 65% of our total revenue.  We sell products to Cyberlink Electronics Limited (Cyberlink), a distributor who sells to various end customers.   Included in the 10 largest direct customers are sales to Cyberlink which accounted for approximately 15% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we believe that sales to Microsoft and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei), directly and indirectly, through subcontractors, accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively, and that our 10 largest direct customers collectively accounted for approximately 70% of our total revenue.  We sell products to Fabrinet Co., Ltd. (Fabrinet), a subcontractor who sells to various end customers.  Included in the 10 largest direct customers are sales to Fabrinet, which accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.  In the year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that sales to Microsoft, Huawei, and Cisco Systems, Inc., directly and indirectly, through subcontractors, accounted for approximately 18%, 14% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively, and that our 10 largest direct customers collectively accounted for approximately 74% of our total revenue.  Included in the 10 largest direct customers are sales to Cyberlink which accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. No other single customer directly or indirectly accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Our design cycle from initial engagement to volume shipment is typically two to three years, with product life cycles in the markets we serve ranging from five to 10 years or more. For many of our products, early engagement with our customers’ technical staff is necessary for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our application and development engineers work closely with our customers to identify and propose solutions to their systems challenges.
 

In addition to our direct customers, we work closely with technology leaders in Tier-1 cloud providers, telecom operators, network system OEMs and optical module and component vendors for the cloud, networking and communications market to anticipate and solve next generation challenges facing our customers. As part of the sales and product development process, we often design our products in close collaboration with these industry leaders and help define their architecture. We also participate actively in setting industry standards with organizations such as IEEE and OIF to have a voice in the definition of future market trends.
 
We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force and a network of sales representatives and distributors.  For the year ended December 31, 2020 we derived 82% of our total revenue from sales by our direct sales team and third-party sales representatives and 18% of our sales were made through third-party distributors.  We operate marketing representative offices in China, Japan, Taiwan, Germany and the United States and employ marketing personnel that meet with our customers locally and interact with our channel partners locally.  Our channel network includes more than one hundred sales and support professionals to support our products and customers. All of these sales professionals are sales agents and are employed by our distributors and sales representatives. We believe these distributors and sales representatives have the requisite technical experience in our target markets and are able to leverage existing relationships and understanding of our customers’ products to effectively sell our products. Given the breadth of our target markets, customers and products, we provide our direct and indirect sales teams with regular training and share product information with our customers and sales teams using web-based tools.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We operate a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test manufacturing contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our semiconductor products. We also inspect and test certain parts in our Irvine and Westlake Village, California facilities. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale and marketing of our products. In addition, we believe outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements.
 
We subject our third-party manufacturing contractors to qualification requirements in order to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. We carefully qualify critical partners and processes before applying the technology to our products. Our engineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs and improve product quality.
 

• | Wafer Fabrication. We currently utilize a wide range of semiconductor processes to develop and manufacture our products. Each of our foundries tends to specialize in a particular semiconductor wafer process technology. We choose the semiconductor process and foundry that we believe provides the best combination of performance attributes for any particular product. For most of our products, we utilize a single foundry for semiconductor wafer production. Our international headquarters in Singapore purchases all wafer material and owns the material until the manufacturing process is complete and the product is shipped to a customer either inside or outside North America or to physical inventory locations for the respective region. Our principal foundries are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC) in Taiwan, WIN Semiconductors Corp. (WIN Semiconductors) in Taiwan, Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in North America, GlobalFoundries in North America and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. (Samsung) in North America and Korea.

We are committed to maintaining the highest level of quality in our products. Our objective is that our products meet all of our customer requirements, are delivered on-time and function reliably throughout their useful lives. As part of our total quality assurance program, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards. Our manufacturing partners are also ISO 9001 certified.
 
Research and Development 
 
We focus our research and development efforts on developing products that address bandwidth bottlenecks in networks and minimize latency in computing environments. We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to both introduce improved versions of our existing products and to develop new products for the markets that we serve. We devote a portion of our resources to expanding our core technology including efforts in system-level simulation, high-speed analog design, supporting a broad range of process technologies and high-speed package modeling and design.
 
We develop models that are used as an input to a combination of proprietary and commercially available simulation tools. We use these tools to predict overall system performance based on the performance of our product. After our product is manufactured, we perform system measurements and refine our model set to improve the model’s accuracy and predictive ability. As a result, our models and simulation tools have improved over time and we have been able to accurately predict overall system performance prior to fabricating a part.
 
We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers in 11 design centers located in the United States, Canada, Germany, Singapore, United Kingdom, Argentina, Romania, Italy and Vietnam. Our technical team typically has, on average, more than 18 years of industry experience with more than 45% having advanced degrees (master’s degree and above) and more than 18% having Ph.Ds. These engineers and designers are involved in advancing our core technologies, as well as applying these core technologies to our product development activities across a number of areas including telecommunications transport systems, enterprise networking equipment, data centers and enterprise servers, storage platforms, test and measurement and military systems.
 
Competition 
 
The global semiconductor market in general, and the communications market in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results.
 
Currently, our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. Our primary competitors include Acacia Communications, Inc., Broadcom Ltd., Renesas Electronics Corporation, M/A-COM Technology Solutions Inc., MaxLinear, Inc., NTT Electronics Corporation, Qorvo, Inc. and Semtech Corp. as well as other smaller analog and mixed signal processing companies. We expect competition in our target markets to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings.
 
Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as our customers reduced their purchase orders. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings with which to withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. These factors may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.
 

We compete or plan to compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including:
 

• | product performance;
--+---------------------


• | power budget;
--+--------------


• | features and functionality;
--+----------------------------


• | customer relationships;

Intellectual Property 
 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we had 984 issued and allowed patents and other patent applications pending in the United States. The 865 issued and allowed patents in the United States expire in the years beginning in 2021 through 2040. Many of our issued patents and pending patent applications relate to high-speed circuit and package designs.
 
We may not receive competitive advantages from any rights granted under our patents, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents. In addition, any future patent may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us.
 
In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licensors for certain technologies embedded in our semiconductor solutions. These are typically non-exclusive contracts provided under paid-up licenses. These licenses are generally perpetual or automatically renewed for so long as we continue to pay any maintenance fees that may be due. To date, maintenance fees have not constituted a significant portion of our annual capital expenditures. We have entered into a number of licensing arrangements pursuant to which we license third-party technologies. We do not believe our business is dependent to any significant degree on any individual third-party license.
 
We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on United States and international copyright laws to protect our mask work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have in the past received and, particularly as a public company, we expect that in the future we may receive, communications from various industry participants alleging our infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. Any lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages, invalidate our proprietary rights and harm our business and our ability to compete. Any litigation, regardless of success or merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, reduce our sales and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In the event we receive an adverse result in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, cease sale of products, expend significant resources to develop alternative technology or discontinue the use of processes requiring the relevant technology.
 
Cybersecurity
 
We have designed and implemented and continue to maintain a security program consisting of policies, procedures, and technology meant to maintain the privacy, security and integrity of our information, systems, and networks. Among other things, the program includes controls designed to limit and monitor access to authorized systems, networks, and data, prevent inappropriate access or modification, and monitor for threats or vulnerability.  We experience thousands of attempts to breach our network every day which we have been successful in preventing from accessing our system.  As regards to the more recent so called “Solar Winds” attacks, we have examined our systems and to date have seen no evidence that we have been breached or affected.
Employees 
 
We believe in promoting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment. We believe these practices are important to recruiting and retaining the talent to allow our organization to achieve its goals and objectives. We monitor the appropriate human capital needs of our departments and functions with particular focus on the areas where human capital resources are important to innovation, customers, and strategic execution.
 
At December 31, 2020, we employed 1,086 full-time equivalent employees, including 780 in research, product development and engineering, 61 in sales and marketing, 96 in general and administrative management and 149 in manufacturing engineering and operations. In certain countries, we have employees who are subject to labor union agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be good and have never experienced a work stoppage.
 
We have operations globally, requiring investment to assess local labor market conditions and recruit and retain the appropriate human capital. Having a business presence in multiple jurisdictions also requires us to monitor local labor and employment laws for which we often engage third-party advisors. We offer our employees’ wages and benefits packages that are in line with respective local labor markets and laws.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the resources required to keep our employees safe and healthy and we are making what we believe are the necessary investments to achieve this goal. In response to the pandemic, we have taken several actions, including supporting our employees to work from home when possible and implementing safety measures in all our facilities. We believe our proactive efforts have been successful in supporting our business growth despite the obstacles and challenges presented by COVID-19.
