The Company owns a 33% interest in Al Masane Al Kobra Mining Company ("AMAK"), a Saudi Arabian closed joint stock mining company, which is engaged in the commercial production of copper and zinc concentrates and silver and gold doré. 
On October 2, 2019, we announced that we had entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we have agreed to sell our entire investment in AMAK. On January 16, 2020, the Purchase Agreement was amended to allow additional time for the parties to obtain certain required governmental approvals. The Amendment also provides that, if closing does not occur on or before March 31, 2020, and the Company determines in its sole discretion to further extend such date, then an amount equal to 50% of the approximately $3.5 million non-refundable deposit will be forfeited to the Company as liquidated damages and shall not be applied to the purchase price at closing. AMAK's historical financial results for the periods presented are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. For further details, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Company also has a 55% interest in Pioche Ely Valley Mines, Inc. ("PEVM"), a Nevada mining corporation, which presently does not conduct any substantial business activity but owns undeveloped properties in the United States.
In November 2019, PEVM entered into a sales contract which, upon completion of due diligence, may lead to liquidation of substantially all of its remaining assets. Upon closing of the sale, PEVM will be dissolved. Any proceeds from the sale will primarily be used to repay outstanding indebtedness of PEVM owed to the Company.
Business Segments
We operate in two business segments; the manufacturing of various specialty petrochemicals products and the manufacturing of specialty waxes.
Our specialty petrochemicals products segment is conducted through SHR, a Texas corporation. SHR owns and operates a specialty petrochemicals facility in Silsbee, Texas which produces high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging, polypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry.   Our specialty petrochemicals products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container, and by ship. SHR owns all of the capital stock of GSPL, a Texas corporation, which owns and operates pipelines that connect the SHR facility to a natural gas line, to SHR's truck and rail loading terminal and to a major petroleum products pipeline owned by an unaffiliated third party. SHR also provides custom processing services at its Silsbee facility.
Our specialty waxes segment is conducted through TC, a Texas corporation, located in Pasadena, Texas which produces specialty polyethylene and poly alpha olefin waxes and provides custom processing services. The specialty polyethylene waxes are used in markets from paints and inks to adhesives, coatings, and PVC lubricants. The highly specialized synthetic poly alpha olefin waxes are used in applications such as toner in printers and as additives for candles. These waxes are sold in solid form as pastilles or, for large adhesive companies, in bulk liquid form.

United States Specialty Petrochemicals Operations
SHR's specialty petrochemicals facility is located in Silsbee, Texas approximately 30 miles north of Beaumont and 90 miles east of Houston. The base SHR facility consists of five operating units which, while interconnected, make distinct products through differing processes: (i) a Penhex Unit; (ii) a Reformer Unit; (iii) a Cyclo-pentane Unit; (iv) an Advanced Reformer unit; and (v) an Isomerization Unit. In addition to the base plant, SHR operates three proprietary chemical production facilities for toll processing customers. The Penhex Unit currently has the permitted capacity to process approximately 11,000 barrels per day of fresh feed. The Reformer Unit, the Advanced Reformer unit, and the Cyclo-Pentane Unit further process streams produced by the Penhex Unit. 
The facility generally consists of equipment commonly found in most petrochemical facilities such as fractionation towers and hydrogen treaters, except the facility is adapted to produce specialized products that are high purity and very consistent with precise specifications that are utilized in the petrochemical industry as solvents, additives, blowing agents and cooling agents.
In 2015, we constructed and started up D Train, a new Penhex production unit at our Silsbee facility. The D Train expansion increased our capacity by approximately 6,000 barrels per day of fresh feed. Our present total capacity is 13,000 barrels per day of fresh feed; however, we are currently only permitted to process 11,000 barrels per day. During 2018, we constructed a 4,000 barrels per day Advanced Reformer unit to increase our capability to upgrade by-products produced from the PenHex Unit and to provide security of hydrogen supply to the plant. We believe we have sufficient pentane capacity to maintain our share of market growth for the foreseeable future.
The Advanced Reformer, Reformer and Isomerization units are operated as needed to support the Penhex and Cyclo-pentane Units. Consequently, utilization rates of these units are driven by production from the Penhex Unit.
Operating utilization rates are affected by product demand, raw material composition, mechanical integrity, and unforeseen natural occurrences, such as weather events. The nature of the petrochemical process demands periodic shut-downs for decoking and other mechanical repairs.
In support of the specialty petrochemicals operation, we own approximately 100 storage tanks with total capacity approaching 285,000 barrels, and 127 acres of land at the plant site, 92 acres of which are developed. We also own a truck and railroad loading terminal consisting of storage tanks, nine rail spurs, and truck and tank car loading facilities on approximately 63 acres of which 33 acres are developed. 
We obtain substantially all our feedstock from a sole supplier. The agreement is primarily a logistics arrangement whereby the supplier buys or contracts for feedstock material and utilizes their tank and pipeline connections to transport into our pipeline. A contract was signed in August 2015 with a seven year term with subsequent one year renewals unless canceled by either party with 180 days' notice. 
GSPL owns and operates two 8-inch diameter pipelines and five 4-inch diameter pipelines, aggregating approximately 70 miles in length connecting SHR's facility to (1) a natural gas line, (2) SHR's truck and rail loading terminal and (3) a major petroleum products pipeline system owned by an unaffiliated third party. All pipelines are operated within Texas Railroad Commission and DOT regulations for maintenance and integrity.
We sell our products predominantly to large domestic and international companies. Products are marketed via personal contact and through continued long term relationships. Sales personnel visit customer facilities regularly and also attend various petrochemical conferences throughout the world. We also provide information about our products and services through our website. We utilize both formula and non-formula based pricing depending upon a customer's requirements and competitive situtations. Under formula pricing the price charged to the customer is primarily based on a formula which includes as a component the average cost of feedstock over the prior month. With this pricing mechanism, product prices move in conjunction with feedstock prices. However, because the formulas use an average feedstock price from the prior month, the movement of prices will trail the movement of costs, and formula prices may or may not reflect our actual feedstock cost for the month during which the product is actually sold. In addition, while formula pricing can reduce product margins during periods of increasing feedstock costs, during periods of decreasing feedstock costs formula pricing will follow feed costs down but will retain higher margins during the period by trailing the movement of costs by approximately 30 days. See additional discussion of concentration of revenue and corresponding receivables as disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2019, PEVM entered into a sales contract which, upon completion of due diligence, may lead to liquidation of substantially all of its remaining assets. Upon closing of the sale, PEVM will be dissolved. Any proceeds from the sale will primarily be used to repay outstanding indebtedness of PEVM owed to the Company.
Environmental
Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 2 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 1993 during remediation of a small spill area, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") required SHR to drill a well to check for groundwater contamination under the spill area. Two pools of hydrocarbons were discovered to be floating on the groundwater at a depth of approximately 25 feet. One pool is under the site of a former gas processing plant owned and operated by Sinclair, Arco and others before its purchase by SHR in 1981. Analysis of the material indicates it entered the ground prior to SHR's acquisition of the property. The other pool is under the original SHR facility and analysis indicates the material was deposited decades ago. Tests conducted have determined that the hydrocarbons are contained on the property and not migrating in any direction. The recovery process was initiated in June 1998 and approximately $53,000 was spent setting up the system. The recovery is proceeding as planned and is expected to continue for many years until the pools are reduced to acceptable levels. Expenses of recovery and periodic migration testing are being recorded as normal operating expenses. Expenses for future recovery are expected to stabilize and be less per annum than the initial set up cost, although there is no assurance of this. The light hydrocarbon recovered from the former gas plant site is compatible with our normal Penhex feedstock and is accumulated and transferred into the Penhex feedstock tank. The material recovered from under the original SHR site is accumulated and sold as a by-product. Approximately 78, 144, and 80 barrels were recovered during 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The recovered material had a value of approximately $4,100, $5,800, and $4,200 during 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Consulting engineers estimate that as much as 20,000 barrels of recoverable material may be available to us for use in our process or for sale. The final volume present and the ability to recover it are both highly speculative issues due to the area over which it is spread and the fragmented nature of the pockets of hydrocarbon. We have drilled additional wells periodically to further delineate the boundaries of the pools and to ensure that migration has not taken place. These tests confirmed that no migration of the hydrocarbon pools has occurred. The TCEQ has deemed the current action plan acceptable and reviews the plan on a semi-annual basis.
Personnel
The number of our regular, U.S. based employees was 270, 280, and 324 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Of these employees, none are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Company and are covered by our benefit plans and programs. Our workforce has decreased primarily due to completion of capital projects at our facilities including a workforce downsizing at SHR in December 2018.

Competition
The specialty petrochemicals, specialty waxes, and mining industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the needs of both industrial and individual consumers. We compete with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services and employ all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes. See further discussion in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Investment in AMAK
As of December 31, 2019, we owned a 33% interest in AMAK.
Location, Access and Transportation.
The facility site is located in Najran province in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Najran, the capital of the province of the same name, is approximately 700 km southeast of Jeddah. The site is located 145 km northwest of Najran, midway between the outpost of Rihab and the district town of Sufah. A modern, paved highway extends from Najran through the town of Habuna passing by the project site and on to Sufah. Another modern, paved highway extends west from the town of Tirima approximately 30 km to the Asir provincial line, becomes a four-lane divided highway, and intersects with a highway leading to Khamis Mushait and Abha. A joining highway then extends down the western slope of the Sarawat mountains to the coastal highway which follows the coast south to the Port of Jazan. The latter is the route AMAK's trucks carry concentrate to the port for export.
Conditions to Retain Title.
The Saudi government granted the Company a mining lease for the Al Masane area comprising approximately 44 square kilometers or approximately 10,870 acres on May 22, 1993 (the "Lease") under Royal Decree No. M/17. The Lease was assigned to AMAK in December 2008. The initial term of the Lease is thirty years beginning May 22, 1993, with AMAK having the option to renew or extend the term of the Lease for additional periods not to exceed twenty years. Under the Lease, AMAK is obligated to pay advance surface rental in the amount of 10,000 Saudi riyals (approximately $2,667 at the current exchange rate) per square kilometer per year (approximately $117,300 annually) during the term of the Lease. In addition, AMAK must pay income tax in accordance with the laws of Saudi Arabia and pay all infrastructure costs. The Lease gives the Saudi Arabian government priority to purchase any gold production from the project, as well as the right to purchase up to 10% of the annual production of other minerals on the same terms and conditions then available to other similar buyers and at current prices then prevailing in the free market. Furthermore, the Lease contains provisions requiring that preferences be given to Saudi Arabian suppliers and contractors and that AMAK employ Saudi Arabian citizens and provide training to Saudi Arabian personnel. In November 2015 AMAK received notification of final approval for additional licenses and leases. The approval includes an additional 151 square kilometers ("km2") of territory contiguous to AMAK's current 44 km2 mine. The new territory comprises the Guyan and Qatan exploration licenses covering 151 km2, and within the Guyan exploration license, a 10 km2 mining lease, which has potential for significant gold recovery. Under the new leases, AMAK is required to pay surface rental of SR 110,000 (approximately $29,333) for a period of 20 years expiring in 2035.
Rock Formations and Mineralization.
Three mineralized zones, the Saadah, Al Houra and Moyeath, have been outlined by diamond drilling. The Saadah and Al Houra zones occur in a volcanic sequence that consists of two mafic-felsic sequences with interbedded exhalative cherts and metasedimentary rocks. The Moyeath zone was discovered after the completion of underground development in 1980. It is located along an angular unconformity with underlying felsic volcanics and shales. The principle sulphide minerals in all of the zones are pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. The precious metals occur chiefly in tetrahedrite and as tellurides and electrum.
Description of Current Property Condition.
The AMAK facility includes an underground mine, ore-treatment plant and related infrastructures. The ore-treatment plant is comprised of primary crushing, ore storage, SAG milling and pebble crushing, secondary ball milling, pre-flotation, copper and zinc flotation, concentrate thickening, tailings filtration, cyanide leaching, reagent handling, tailings dam and utilities. Related infrastructure includes a 300 man capacity camp for single status accommodation for expatriates and Saudi Arabian employees, an on-site medical facility, a service building for 300 employees, on-site diesel generation of 15 megawatts, potable water supply primarily from an underground aquifer, sewage treatment plant and an assay laboratory. The facilities at the Port of Jazan are comprised of unloading facilities, concentrate storage and reclamation and ship loading facilities. The above-ground ore processing facility became fully operational during the second half of 2012. Late in the fourth quarter of 2015, AMAK temporarily closed the operation to preserve the assets in the ground while initiating steps to improve efficiencies and optimize operations. The plant resumed operation in the fourth quarter of 2016 and operating rates, metal recoveries and concentrate quality has continued to improve since.
AMAK shipped approximately 65,000, 58,000, and 28,000 metric tons of copper and zinc concentrate to outside smelters during 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In 2014 AMAK initiated operation of its precious metal recovery circuit at the mill 
4

and produced gold and silver doré intermittently through 2014 and 2015. The precious metals circuit was recommissioned in the fourth quarter of 2017 and produced commercial quantities of gold and silver bearing doré in 2018.
Saudi Industrial Development Fund ("SIDF") Loan and Guarantee
On October 24, 2010, we executed a limited guarantee in favor of the SIDF guaranteeing up to 41% of the SIDF loan to AMAK in the principal amount of 330,000,000 Saudi Riyals (US$88,000,000) (the "Loan"). As a condition of the Loan, SIDF required all shareholders of AMAK to execute personal or corporate guarantees totaling 162.55% of the overall Loan amount. As ownership percentages have changed over time, the loan guarantee allocation has not changed. The other AMAK shareholders provided personal guarantees. We were the only AMAK shareholder providing a corporate guarantee. The loan was required in order for AMAK to fund construction of the underground and above-ground portions of its mining project in southwest Saudi Arabia and to provide working capital for commencement of operations. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting Treatment of Investment in AMAK.
We have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of AMAK and therefore, account for it using the equity method. We have three representatives on the Board of Directors of AMAK. Two representatives serve on the Audit Committee, one as Chair, and the third representative serves as Chair on the Commercial Committee of AMAK. AMAK is effectively self-operating under a new, experienced management team. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We assess our investment in AMAK for impairment when events are identified, or there are changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. To perform our assessment we consider operating results, recoverable ore reserves, and mineral prices.
