Merger
 
On October 7, 2016, we completed our previously announced Merger with AVM, pursuant to which SAVM Acquisition Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, merged with and into AVM, with AVM surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger, the former shareholders of AVM received shares of our common stock representing approximately 77.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the post-Merger combined company, and the Company’s former shareholders retained approximately 22.1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the post-Merger combined company, in each case including unvested shares of restricted stock in the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Presentation for Reverse Stock Split 
 
On January 5, 2017, we effected a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, and the per share exercise price of and number of shares of our common stock underlying our outstanding stock options, was automatically proportionally adjusted based on the 1-for-35 Reverse Stock Split ratio. Except as otherwise provided herein, all share and per-share amounts of our common stock and stock options have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. The Reverse Stock Split did not alter the par value of our common stock, which remains at $0.001 per share, modify any voting rights or other terms of our common stock, or impact the amount of preferred stock we are authorized to issue.
Company Overview
 
The Company is a leading provider of live video social networking, and interactive dating applications. Our product portfolio includes Paltalk and Camfrog, which together host one of the world's largest collections of video-based communities, and FirstMet, a prominent interactive dating brand serving users 35 and older. Our other products include Tinychat, Firetalk, 50More, Ribbit Live, The Grade, and Vumber. Our leading network of products creates a unique social media enterprise where users can meet, see, chat, broadcast and message in real time with other users in our network. Our properties are generally available through Windows®, MacTM OS, iOSTM and AndroidTM platforms.
 
We believe that live video is in the early stages of adoption for applications related to meeting, chatting, dating, broadcasting and other interactive purposes and over time presents an attractive growth opportunity as it becomes pervasively integrated across the social networking and interactive communications industries. The proprietary technology underlying our products allows us to operate thousands of simultaneous streams, including on mobile platforms, that support interactions on a one-on-one, one-to-many and many-to-many basis. We believe our technology represents a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, most of our technology is supported by a portfolio of 25 issued patents.
 
We also have a worldwide established presence and brand identity in both live video chat and interactive dating, with users in over 180 countries as of March 12, 2017. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of key business opportunities in our industry by leveraging our technology, user base and suite of complementary applications to incorporate live and recorded video into the dating experience, as well as to bring dating opportunities to our video chat community.
 
Snap was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2005 and AVM was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1998. Our principal executive office is located at 122 East 42nd Street, Suite 2600, New York, New York 10168.
 
Key Business Strengths
 
Early Mover to Live Video
 
We believe our early development and use of live video and dating applications has enabled us to have a leading position in the live video industry today. Our products Paltalk and Camfrog together host one of the world's largest collections of video-based communities and we believe live video will in time become ubiquitous and an integral element of social networking, messaging and online business applications. Our early mover advantage should help enable us to seize growth opportunities with existing and new products as the popularity and pervasiveness of live video increases.

Engaging Functionality
 
We have designed our applications with browse functions and other features that prompt interactions between users, which make our applications highly engaging and easy to use. While many online applications and websites provide similar functionality, many competitive services require meaningful effort and initiative on the part of the user to make contact with other users. Our applications are designed to eliminate effort and friction in user-to-user interaction by organizing users around common interests or automating certain aspects of the introductory dialog between users. As a result, we believe our users find our experience more social and enjoyable than many competitive social networking and dating services.
Freemium Online Model 
 
We operate our video chat and dating products on a “freemium” model in which certain application features are free to all users and other features are only available to paid subscribers or other paying members. Dating users are allowed to create a profile, browse, search and view profiles of other users, send instant messages and send an initial message to any user. Premium features, such as access to multiple video chat rooms and enhanced status in the community for our video chat applications or unlimited custom messaging for our dating applications, require a paid subscription. We believe this “freemium” model differentiates us from some other like applications in the industry.
 
Data-Driven Model 
 
We have developed data analytics and application development processes that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage over many other video chat and online dating applications and platforms. Our data analytics provide us with critical visibility into the effectiveness of our sales and marketing expense which allows us to quickly modify such expenditures to create more effective user acquisition campaigns. Our application development processes include a sophisticated A/B testing framework, a framework for comparing two versions of the same application, which allows us to test new features, new functionality, design changes, changes to our proprietary algorithms and compare our results to control groups. These processes provide a real-time granular analysis of user behavior with the intention to modify our applications to improve the user experience as well as increase user engagement in order to increase the number of users that convert into paying subscribers. This capability is presently being integrated across all products at the Company.
 
Highly Scalable Platform 
 
Our applications are extremely scalable and require limited incremental cost to host additional users, create new features catering to additional discrete audiences, or to build new applications based on developed feature-sets with new brand identities. Our video chat properties are built on highly scalable architecture which enables them to power thousands of chat rooms and live streams simultaneously. This technology is used to power topical discussions in several different formats, including interactions on a one-on-one, one-to-many and many-to-many basis. Our dating platforms allow thousands of simultaneous users to browse the profile of other users, message other users or otherwise be active on our website and applications.
Subscriber Base
 
Our applications and the majority of revenues generated therefrom are supported by a large user database of approximately 183,000 active subscribers worldwide as of March 12, 2017. Our management believes that the scale of our subscriber base presents a competitive advantage in the video chat and dating industry and can present growth opportunities to combine video with dating to advance existing products with upsell opportunities as well as to build future brands with cross-sell offers. The scale of our usage also offers us the opportunity to build our third party advertising revenue.
Company Business Strategy
 
Merge Video and Dating 
 
We believe there is a significant opportunity to combine the features and ease of live video with the desire of people to meet and date. We believe many of our video chat users participate in live video chat as a means to meet others, including potentially for dating. We also believe that recorded and live video will become important enhancements to the online dating experience as the interactive dating industry evolves. We feel we have a significant early mover advantage with our relevant technologies and presence in both areas.

On February 6, 2017, we released an update to Paltalk that includes navigation to a new “Dating” section that encourages Paltalk users to register for FirstMet to connect with a large pool of users seeking romantic relationships. We hope that this opportunity to cross-sell FirstMet to existing Paltalk users will enhance user engagement and monetization, and we plan to continue to integrate the complementary features and audiences of our live video and dating applications.
 
Introduce New Applications
 
We plan to develop a portfolio of applications around our core video chat and dating applications by investing resources to both develop and launch new mobile applications and new iterations of our existing product platforms targeting specific demographics or geographies. For example, we recently introduced a limited beta launch of 50more in the first quarter of 2017. 50more is based on FirstMet’s scalable dating platform and has similar functionality to FirstMet but addresses a different target audience of adults over 50 and is based on a new brand identity. We have also started developing a new live video chat consumer application based on our video chat infrastructure technology.
 
Develop a Business-to-Business Platform for Partnering Opportunities
 
We believe our video technology has broad applications to many other industries beyond social networking. Additionally we believe that our technology is scalable and is capable of supporting significantly more usage than currently utilized. We intend to explore opportunities to collaborate with leading companies in other industries which would benefit from a video platform to support their product fulfillment. These partnerships can take many different forms, all of which ultimately may help us to drive the value of our technology and build our business.
 
Focus on Merger & Acquisition Opportunities
 
We have built our Company through a series of strategic acquisitions to help build our technology and product portfolio, as well as increase our size and scale. We believe our industry is significantly fragmented, with numerous opportunities for consolidation. In addition, new market entrants are likely to continue to emerge in our industry as a result of consumers having a propensity to try new products to connect with new people. We intend to continue to target acquisitions to help grow and diversify ourselves from both a product and geographic perspective, while further establishing ourselves as a leading player in the live video and interactive dating space.
Defend our Intellectual Property
 
We have a portfolio of 25 issued patents. We have successfully defended our intellectual property in the past and have generated tens of millions of dollars in licensing fees for the use of our patents. In 2016, we commenced an enforcement action related to two of our patents against Riot Games, Inc. and Valve Corporation for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,523 and 6,226,686 with respect to their online games League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2. These two patents were previously asserted against, and then licensed to, Microsoft, Sony, and Activision.
Our Products
 
Live Video Chat
 
We have 5 products in the video chat space: Paltalk; Camfrog; Tinychat; Ribbit Live; and Firetalk. The major revenue-generating products and current focus of the Company are Paltalk and Camfrog. Each product enables individuals to self-organize around topics and users with common affinities. Tinychat, Ribbit Live and Firetalk enable adaptations of our video technology for alternative uses and opportunities in the future.
 
Key features and tools of our video chat applications include:
 

● | Profile Creation: Our video chat products are intuitive and allow users to easily find, connect and communicate with each other based on a user’s particular interest. Users can join our video chat properties by creating a personal profile that is connected to their email address or by using “Facebook Connect®” to create a profile. A user with a Facebook® profile can easily import information from his or her profile, including photos and interest data. Once a profile has been created, users are able to search our thousands of chat rooms organized by topics and easily click to join one. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dynamic Tools and Features: Our video chat products are also dynamic and offer the chance for users to message and/or talk with others while also viewing them through live video. Once a user joins a chat room, he/she can directly message another individual or join a group community chat. Users also have the option to listen to the group through their device microphone and to join a queue for a turn to speak out loud to the group. Two users can also choose to have a one-on-one private live video chat. Our products offer the tools for users to administer the experience in a particular chat room. Users that open chat rooms can mute other users, restrict other users from broadcasting video, and remove a user’s ability to text. Additionally, each user that opens a chat room not only can exercise these administrative controls, they can also deputize other users to be administrators in their rooms further helping to create a managed and enjoyable experience.

Paltalk and Camfrog. Paltalk and Camfrog are our major video chat applications and are both leading providers of live video social networking applications available on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android and other tablet devices. Together, these products power one of the world’s largest global collections of video-based communities, with proprietary technology to host thousands of simultaneous live group conversations on topics such as politics, financial markets, music and dating. Our proprietary client server technology helps maintain high quality video and audio even as many users simultaneously watch a particular broadcaster. Paltalk and Camfrog both have tens of millions of registered users and attract a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries, in each case as of March 12, 2017. Paltalk users are approximately one-third domestic and two-thirds international, whereas the majority of Camfrog users are international, with a particular concentration in Southeast Asia.

Dating
 
We currently have three dating applications: FirstMet, 50more and The Grade. FirstMet generates substantially all of the revenue in our dating portfolio. 50more, our product targeting users over 50, was introduced in a limited beta launch in the first quarter of 2017. For the foreseeable future, we expect to focus our dating application resources on FirstMet and 50more. We have deemphasized our promotional efforts for The Grade but expect that it may provide opportunities as a platform for future product evolution.
 
FirstMet. We provide a leading online dating application under the FirstMet brand, formerly called “Are You Interested?” (“AYI”). In March 2016, we completed a rebranding of AYI under the name FirstMet. We believe FirstMet’s distinctive features and fresh brand identity offer a superior user experience to that of the original AYI. FirstMet is native on Facebook, iOS and Android platforms and is also accessible on mobile devices and desktops at FirstMet.com. FirstMet is extremely scalable and requires limited incremental operational cost to add users, active subscribers or new features catering to additional discrete audiences. FirstMet was the #24 grossing application in the U.S. Lifestyle Category on the Apple App Store in the United States as of March 12, 2017.
 
FirstMet attracts a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries as of March 12, 2017. FirstMet is intuitive, and allows users and subscribers to easily find, connect and communicate with each other. Key features and tools of the application include:
 

● | Profile Creation: Users can join FirstMet by creating a personal profile that is connected to their email address or by using “Facebook Connect” to create a profile. A FirstMet user with a Facebook profile can easily import information from his or her profile, including photos and interest data. Once a profile has been created, FirstMet users are able to browse for potential matches, including other singles with similar interests. We frequently update FirstMet’s feature set with new features to increase user engagement, make users more social and to increase the number of users that are converted to active subscribers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Browse Function: FirstMet’s game-like “browse” function presents profiles of other users that match user criteria and prompts them to indicate if they are “interested” by either clicking on a “yes” or “skip” button above the profile picture or by sending a message when viewing that user’s profile. Users are notified when another user has clicked “yes” on their profile or if they have received a message from another user. In instances where users select "yes" on each other’s profile, the application automatically introduces the two users, because they have shown mutual interest. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
50more. We introduced 50more in limited beta launch in the first quarter of 2017 as our dating application targeting adults over the age of 50. Our FirstMet infrastructure and technology platform allowed us to streamline the process of launching 50more as a new and fresh online dating product. 50more has similar functionality to FirstMet but addresses a different target audience of adults over 50 and is based on a new brand identity. We expect that we will operate 50more in parallel with FirstMet in order to leverage the overlap with FirstMet’s user base and cross-sell our users with multiple brands. 50more is available on mobile and desktop platforms.
 
The Grade. The Grade is a free mobile application that caters to individuals who are dissatisfied with the quality of user interactions on mobile online dating applications. The Grade launched in November 2014 and is native on iOS and Android. The Grade was designed to hold users accountable to a high standard of behavior by using a proprietary algorithm that assigns letter grades to users ranging from “A+” to “F” based on profile quality, messaging quality and reviews from other users of the application.
 
Early adopters of The Grade were in the 25–35 year old demographic, which we believe is the most crowded and competitive space in the online dating market. Despite the uniqueness and early success of The Grade, we decided in late 2015 to shift our resource-focus to the rebranding of FirstMet, with its established user base, and the development of 50more, our dating product for adults over 50, targeting what we believe to be one of the fastest growing and least competitive demographic in the online dating industry.

As a result of this shift in resources, we have sustained a significantly lower level of spending on sales and marketing for The Grade and subsequently have experienced a decrease in the number of users and activity on the application. We believe The Grade remains a viable product with relevant technology, and may provide a platform in the future for other product opportunities.
 
Telecommunications 
 
We own and operate a small telecommunications provider called Vumber that enables users to have multiple phone numbers in any area code through which calls can be forwarded to a user’s existing cell phone or land line telephone number. Vumber serves both the retail and small business community. Vumber not only allows individuals to communicate while protecting privacy, but also gives business professionals the ability to add a new business line with any chosen area code to their cell phones. Vumber provides an in-depth data analytics platform that can track, record and analyze calls to gain new insights into one’s business.
Product Development
 
We are continually developing new products, as well as optimizing our existing platforms and feature sets in order to meet the evolving needs of our user base and advertising partners.
 
We develop most of our software internally. We will, however, purchase technology and license intellectual property rights where it is strategically important, operationally compatible, or economically advantageous. For instance, we partner with third parties to further our internationalization efforts as we look to bring additional languages into our existing platforms. We are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to product development.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We invest in advertising and marketing for the purpose of acquiring users. We adapt our marketing expenditures and channels as we gather the data to analyze the success of our campaigns. We primarily advertise through Internet and mobile advertising networks and run hundreds of campaigns at any given time, targeting various audiences of users, and focusing on campaigns that we believe will produce a positive return over the lifetime of new users. We also generate new sign-ups organically, as people find our sites through brand recognition and word of mouth, search engines and product review websites.
Payment Options
 
Our users have a variety of methods by which to purchase subscriptions across all of our platforms. Users can pay by credit card, PayPal, Western Union, Check, local e-wallet providers, or complete an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android users. Apple retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on our iPhone application through in-app purchases in the United States. Google also retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on Android applications via Google wallet through in-app purchases in the United States.
 
All of our credit card transactions are processed through various payment providers. Video chat users in certain international territories also have an option to purchase through local resellers. Local resellers prepay in bulk for services and debit the prepaid balance as one-time subscriptions and virtual currency are sold to end users. Regardless of which payment method is utilized, users may access our products through any of the gateways we offer.
 
Competition and Our Industry
 
We face substantial competition in both the live video and dating industries. We have direct competition from many live video streaming websites including YouNow, Live.me, BIGO Live, Live.ly, Houseparty, ooVoo, and Discord. In the dating industry, we compete with online dating websites such as OkCupid.com, Christianmingle.com, eHarmony.com, POF.com, Match Group, Inc. properties, as well as online dating applications provided by Badoo Trading Limited, IAC, MeetMe, Inc. and Zoosk, Inc. We also face substantial competition from mobile-based applications including Tinder, Happn, Hinge and Bumble. In addition, the products within our portfolio both compete and collaborate with each other.


As technology evolves and the lines between video and dating become less defined, many of these and other properties will become our competitors. There are relatively few significant barriers to entry in our industry and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and technical expertise may become a competitor. Nonetheless, we believe that users often utilize multiple applications for multiple purposes, and the use of one website or application is not necessarily to the exclusion of others.
 
Achieving a critical mass of users is crucial for all of our video chat and dating applications. As a result of our large and dynamic user base, we believe we are well-positioned to continue as a leader in both of the industries in which we currently operate. Additionally, we seek to offer applications and services that are differentiated in the industry, superior in quality and more appealing than those of our competitors. We also believe that we have the tools and expertise to attract new users through Facebook and other sources at a lower cost per subscriber than certain of our traditional competitors. As social networking application platforms and mobile platforms continue to expand and the Internet becomes ever more of a mainstream method for connecting and interacting with others, we believe that the industries we operate within offer substantial room for growth.

Patent and Trademarks
 
To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, patent applications, confidentiality agreements and other contractual rights. We have 26 registered trademarks in the United States and internationally. We have a patent portfolio of 25 patents, and we have historically generated tens of millions of dollars successfully defending our patents. We continue to pursue patents related to certain feature sets on applications currently under development, as well as defend our intellectual property as appropriate. In 2016, we commenced an enforcement action related to two of our patents against Riot Games, Inc. and Valve Corporation for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,523 and 6,226,686 with respect to their online games League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2. These two patents were previously asserted against, and then licensed to, Microsoft, Sony, and Activision.
Governmental Regulations
 
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and being litigated in the courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, which are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. We are also subject to diverse and evolving laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. Because our online dating applications are accessible worldwide and used by residents of some foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we must comply with foreign laws, even in jurisdictions in which we have no local business entity, employees or infrastructure.
 
We are also subject to federal laws and regulations regarding content, privacy and the protection of user data, including The Communications Decency Act of 1996, as amended (“The Communications Decency Act”), The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (“CAN-SPAM”) Act of 2003, among others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits our liability as an online service provider for linking to or hosting third-party content that infringes copyrights. The Communications Decency Act provides statutory protections to online service providers like us who distribute third-party content. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of online service providers to collect personal information from children under 13. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many states have promulgated laws and regulations regarding email advertising, including the CAN-SPAM Act. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing the protections of these laws may subject us to increased risk, increased costs of compliance, and limits on the operation of certain parts of our business.
 
Growing public concern about privacy and the use of personal information may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny. The FTC has, over the last few years, begun investigating companies that have used personally identifiable information in a deceptive or unfair manner or in violation of a posted privacy policy. If we are accused of violating the terms of our privacy policy or implementing unfair privacy practices, we may be forced to expend significant financial and managerial resources to defend against an FTC enforcement action. Our user database holds the personal information of our users and subscribers residing in the United States and other countries, and we could be sued by those users if any of the information is misappropriated. Any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could also result in loss of user confidence in our online dating applications and services and ultimately in a loss of active subscribers, which could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, virtually every U.S. state has passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data resulting in unauthorized disclosure, many of which are modeled on California’s Information Practices Act. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress and various state legislative bodies concerning data protection that could, if adopted, have an adverse effect on our business. We are unable to determine if and when such legislation may be adopted. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted breach notification and other data protection notification laws designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. The introduction of new privacy and data breach laws and the interpretation of existing privacy and data breach laws in the United States, Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is constantly evolving. There is a risk that new laws may be introduced or existing laws may be applied in a way that would conflict our current data protection practices or prevent the transfer of data between countries in which we operate.

While online personal services are not currently required to verify the age or identity of subscribers, or to run criminal background checks, legislation in this area has been proposed over the last few years in Ohio, Texas, California, Michigan, New Jersey, Florida and Virginia. Companies that provide personal services are not currently subject to the same type of regulation as companies deemed “dating service” providers. However, if a court holds that we are legally providing “dating services” as defined in the relevant regulations, we may be required to comply with additional state regulations. Further, Connecticut, New York, Florida, Texas and New Jersey each have enacted laws that require us to display safety warnings and disclosures to users that we do not conduct background checks.
 
In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our online dating applications or restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business. These regulatory and legislative developments, including excessive taxation, may prevent or significantly limit our ability to expand our business.
 
Employees
 
As of March 12, 2017, we had 57 employees. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. We attract and retain employees by offering training, bonus opportunities, competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package.
