 BUSINESS

 
  OVERVIEW
  
 Crexendo, Inc. is an award-winning premier provider of cloud communications, UCaaS, call center, collaboration services, and other cloud business services that are designed to provide enterprise-class cloud services to any size business at affordable monthly rates. The Company has two operating segments, which consist of Cloud Telecommunications and Web Services.
 
 Cloud Telecommunications – Our cloud telecommunications services transmit calls using Internet Protocol (IP) or cloud technology, which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the Internet or cloud. Each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers, plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe offer an attractive value proposition to our customers. This platform enables a user, via a single “identity” or telephone number, to access and utilize services and features regardless of how the user is connected to the Internet or cloud, whether it’s from a desktop device, computer, or an application on a mobile device.
 
 We generate recurring revenue from our cloud telecommunications and reselling broadband Internet services. Our cloud telecommunications contracts typically have a thirty-six to sixty month term. We generate product revenue and equipment financing revenue from the sale and lease of our cloud telecommunications equipment. Revenues from the sale of equipment, including those from sales-type leases, are recognized at the time of sale or at the inception of the lease, as appropriate.
 
 Web Services – We generate recurring revenue from website hosting and other professional services.

Our solutions scale easily and quickly, allowing our customers to add new users through a web portal regardless of where they are located. Our solutions are very cost effective, often saving businesses up to 50% off of their existing telecom spend. Migrating to our system requires little to no upfront infrastructure hardware costs and our solutions require no ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs that are commonly associated with legacy on-premise systems.
  
 We sell our Crexendo solution as an all-inclusive, feature rich communications platform that allows customers to eliminate their older, premise-based systems and the costs associated with local dial tone, long distance, maintenance, support and upgrades. Since our system includes features such as Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) for call centers, record-a-call, mobility, and collaboration all as standard offerings, we have a significant advantage over many of our competitors who charge much higher fees for these types of applications. In addition, our solution is also a great, cost effective solution for businesses that are already using cloud communications from a competitive UCaaS provider as we can likely easily migrate their existing VoIP phones over to our system and likely offer them more capabilities at a lower cost.
  
 We believe that our solutions provide not only the core functionality of existing on-premise communications solutions, but also additional key benefits that address the changing requirements of business to allow businesses to function in remote work environments using voice, video, collaboration, SMS/text, chat and mobility.

   ●
 Device Independence. We not only design, sell and support our own Crexendo branded phones that work with our system, but our solution is also able to support a wide range of industry standard VoIP devices from manufacturers such as Polycom, Yealink, Cisco, H-tek, and Grandstream allowing customers to utilize existing hardware if needed. We also support mobile devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops, allowing businesses many options to meet their communications needs.

  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
 We invested $1,189,000 and $853,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the research and development of our technologies and data center. The majority of these expenditures were for enhancements to our cloud telecommunications products and services and website development software.
 COMPETITION
  
 The market for cloud business communications services is large and increasingly competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. Some of these competitors include:
 
   ●
 traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Mitel, NEC, and Siemens Enterprise Networks, LLC, any of which may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud;

   ●
 software providers such as Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Teams (formerly Skype for Business)) and BroadSoft, Inc. (acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc.) that generally license their software and may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud, and their resellers including major carriers and cable companies;

   ●
 established communications providers that resell on-premise hardware, software, and hosted solutions, such as AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc., CenturyLink, Cox, Charter and Comcast Corporation in the United States, TELUS and others in Canada, and BT, Vodafone, and others in the United Kingdom, all of whom have significantly greater resources than us and do now or may in the future also develop and/or host their own or other solutions through the cloud;

   ●
 other cloud companies such as 8x8, Inc., RingCentral, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., DialPad, Inc., Fusion, Fuze (formerly Thinking Phone Networks), StarBlue (merger of Star2Star and BlueFace), Intermedia.net, Inc., J2 Global, Inc., Jive Communications, Inc. (acquired by LogMeIn, Inc.), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Teams (formerly Skype for Business)), Mitel, Nextiva, Inc., Slack Technologies, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., and West Corporation;

   ●
 other large internet companies such as Alphabet Inc., Facebook, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Zoom, and Salesforce.com, Inc., any of which might launch its own cloud-based business communication services or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future; and

   ●
 established contact center providers such as Amazon.com, Inc., Aspect Software, Inc., Avaya Inc., Five9, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., and NewVoiceMedia.

 
 Additionally, should we determine to pursue acquisition opportunities, we may compete with other companies with similar growth strategies. Some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition.
  
 There are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. Our proprietary technology does not preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our markets. In particular, we anticipate new entrants will attempt to develop competing products and services or new forums for conducting e-commerce and telecommunications services which could be deemed competition. Additionally, if telecommunications service providers with more resources and name recognition were to enter our markets, they may redefine our industry and make it difficult for us to compete.
  
 Expected technology advances associated with the Cloud, increasing use of the Cloud, and new software products are welcome advancements that we believe will broaden the Cloud’s viability. We anticipate that we can compete successfully by relying on our infrastructure, marketing strategies and techniques, systems and procedures, and by adding additional products and services in the future. We believe we can continue the operation of our business by periodic review and revision to our product offerings and marketing approach.
  
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  
 Our success depends in part on using and protecting our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. Furthermore, we must conduct our operations without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely upon trade secrets and the know-how and expertise of our key employees. To protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, we rely on a combination of the protections provided by applicable copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements. Although we believe we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property rights, including requiring employees and third parties who are granted access to our intellectual property to enter into confidentiality agreements, these measures may not be sufficient to protect our rights against third parties. Others may independently develop or otherwise acquire unpatented technologies or products similar or superior to ours.
 
 We license from third parties certain software and Internet tools which we include in our services and products. If any of these licenses were terminated, we could be required to seek licenses for similar software and Internet tools from other third parties or develop these tools internally. We may not be able to obtain such licenses or develop such tools in a timely fashion, on acceptable terms, or at all.

 Companies participating in the software, Internet technology, and telecommunication industries are frequently involved in disputes relating to intellectual property. We may be required to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement, duplication, discovery and misappropriation by third parties or to defend against third-party claims of infringement. Likewise, disputes may arise in the future with respect to ownership of technology developed by employees who were previously employed by other companies. Any such litigation or disputes could be costly and divert our attention from our business. An adverse determination could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from, or pay royalties to, third parties, or require us to develop appropriate alternative technology. Some or all of these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may be unable to develop alternate technology at an acceptable price, or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial position, or results of operations.

  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
  
 As a provider of Internet communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC.

We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services. We are a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in forty-seven states. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in these states. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement to register or seek certification to provide its services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements.
  
 We are subject to regulations generally applicable to all businesses. We are also subject to an increasing number of laws and regulations directly applicable to telecommunication, internet access and commerce. The adoption of any such additional laws or regulations may decrease the rate of growth of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services. Such laws may also increase our costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial position or results of operations. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy is uncertain. Future federal or state legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
