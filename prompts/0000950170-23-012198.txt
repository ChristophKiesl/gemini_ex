Item 1. Business.
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Fathom Digital Manufacturing Corporation ("Fathom", the "Company") and its consolidated subsidiaries as the context so requires.
 
Fathom, through our operating subsidiary Fathom Holdco, LLC (“Fathom OpCo” or "Predecessor"), is a leading on-demand digital manufacturing platform in North America, providing comprehensive product development and production part manufacturing to many of the largest and most innovative companies in the world. We have extensive expertise in both additive and traditional manufacturing, enabling our agile, technology-agnostic platform to blend manufacturing technologies and processes to deliver hybridized solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our customers. This flexible problem-solving approach empowers our customers to accelerate their product development cycles, reducing manufacturing lead times for low to mid-volume production.
 
We combine diverse, scaled manufacturing capabilities and deep technical know-how to enable our customers to get to market faster, putting their design and product goals above the manufacturing limitations often imposed by other service providers. We pair our expertise and manufacturing capabilities with a unified proprietary suite of software, which becomes an extension of the customer’s digital product development and low to mid-volume production threads. By continuously augmenting our software suite to stay in tune with evolving Industry 4.0 trends, we believe our platform is ideally suited to serve the product development and low-to mid-volume production parts needs of the largest and most innovative companies in the world.
 
Our differentiated strategy focuses on speed, problem solving, adaptive technical responsiveness, and a focus on manufacturing to meet customers’ design intent, allowing our customers to iterate faster and shorten their product development and production cycles from months to days.
 
Our deep technical expertise and integrated, software-driven approach underpin a comprehensive suite of capabilities, with over 25 unique manufacturing processes spread across 12 manufacturing facilities with nearly 450,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in the United States ("U.S."). Our scale and breadth of offerings allows our customers to consolidate their supply chain and product development needs and to source through a single supplier. Fathom seamlessly blends in-house capabilities of 530+ advanced manufacturing systems across plastic and metal additive technologies (90+ industrial-grade systems), computer numerical control ("CNC") machining, injection molding and tooling, precision sheet metal fabrication, and design engineering, catering to a broad set of end markets. Fathom’s manufacturing technologies and capacity are further extended through utilization of a selected group of highly qualified suppliers who specialize in injection molding and tooling and CNC machining.
 
With over 35 years of industry experience, Fathom is at the forefront of the Industry 4.0 digital manufacturing revolution, serving customers in the technology, defense, aerospace, medical, automotive and IOT sectors. Fathom’s certifications include: International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016, AS9100:2016, NIST800-171 and International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") registered.
 
Fathom is also a platform built for taking advantage of attractive future merger and acquisition opportunities. Fathom’s acquisition strategy is enabled by our unique integration playbook including our proprietary software platform.
 
Fathom’s business was founded in 1984 under the name Midwest Composite Technologies, LLC ("MCT"). Following the merger of MCT and Kemeera, LLC in 2019, the business was rebranded to operate under the “Fathom Digital Manufacturing” name and key technical capabilities were added in direct response to the needs of our largest and most innovative corporate customers. Today, Fathom is the result of the successful integration of 13 complementary companies, acquired over the past four years, creating a robust on-demand digital manufacturing platform with a proven array of additive and traditional manufacturing capabilities.
 
As a result of our scale and superior offerings, we have developed a loyal base of approximately 2,500 customers, including many of the largest and most innovative companies in the world, with excellent representation across Fortune’s 500 list. Over the year ended December 31, 2022, no single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue.
 
Our target market consists of the highly fragmented U.S. low-to mid-volume manufacturing market of CNC machining, injection molding, precision sheet metal and additive manufacturing. This market is projected to grow, fueled by increased demand for additive manufacturing and continuation of the trend of customers increasingly outsourcing their product development prototyping and low-to mid-volume manufacturing needs.
 

Our People
 
Our employees are the foundation of Fathom’s enterprise and are essential to maintaining our business model and competitive advantages. As of December 31, 2022, we had 708 employees working across our U.S. locations. Our employees are distributed across functions, including engineering, production, sales, marketing, and general corporate functions. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.

Our human capital resource objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plans is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.

The health and well-being of our employees are critical to our ongoing ability to operate and serve our customers. We are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees across each location and job function – this includes providing broad benefits to support their health and wellness needs. We continue to place the utmost importance on complying with governmental regulations and health authority guidance to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to protect the well-being of all people engaged with our business.

Government Regulations
 
We are subject to various laws, regulations and permitting requirements of federal, state, and local authorities, including related to environmental and health and safety. We are also subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations related to anti-corruption, data privacy, use and security, embargoes, sanctions, and trade and export controls, including those of the jurisdictions in which we operate, source from, or make sales to. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations, and permitting requirements. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere regarding our business operations and activities may impede our growth, significantly increase our operating costs and impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to domestic environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including, but not limited to, emissions into the air and water and the use, handling, disposal, and remediation of hazardous substances. A certain risk of environmental liability is inherent in our production activities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the generation, use, storage, registration, handling, and disposal of chemicals and waste materials, the presence of specified substances in electrical products, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals and other waste materials, and the health and safety of our employees. We are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. The cost of complying with current and future environmental laws applicable to our operations, or the liabilities arising from past releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may result in future expenditures.
