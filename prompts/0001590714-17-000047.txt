Industrial Solutions - representing approximately 25% of the segment's 2016 net sales. As a leader in industrial metal and plastic finishing chemistries based on 2016 net sales, our dynamic chemistries in this industry are used for finishing, cleaning and providing surface coatings for a broad range of metal and non-metal surfaces.  These coatings may have functional uses, including improving wear and tear, such as hard chrome plating of shock absorbers for cars and special rotors used for oil and gas exploration, or providing corrosion resistance for appliance parts, or decorative uses, such as gloss finishes to components used in automotive interiors.  Our chemical compounds are manufactured for these surface coating applications, including cleaning, activating, polishing, electro and electroless plating, phosphatizing, stripping and coating, anti-tarnishing and rust inhibiting for metal and plastic surfaces.  Electroless plating is a method of plating metals onto a variety of base materials using chemical reduction without the application of electrical power.  Electro plating, in contrast, involves plating metals with the use of an electrical current.  Phosphatizing is the application of phosphates, such as iron and zinc, to prevent corrosion of steel surfaces.  Our industrial customer base is highly fragmented and includes customers in the following end markets: appliances and electronics equipment; automotive parts; industrial parts; plumbing goods; and transportation equipment.  We believe our growth in this industry will be primarily driven by increased worldwide automobile production with elevated fashion elements and content per vehicle.

We produce and market photopolymers through an extensive line of flexographic plates that are used in the commercial packaging and printing industries. We manufacture photopolymers used to produce printing plates for transferring images onto commercial packaging, including packaging for consumer food products, pet food bags, corrugated boxes, labels and beverage containers. In addition, we also produce photopolymer printing plates for the flexographic and letterpress newspaper and publications markets. Our products are used to improve print quality and printing productivity. Flexography is a printing process that utilizes flexible printing plates made of rubber or other flexible plastics. Photopolymers are molecules that change properties upon exposure to light. Our business mix in this industry is focused on high innovation, higher cash flow businesses by offering new products. We believe growth in this business will be driven by consumer demand and advertising of our packaging products. 
Offshore Solutions - representing approximately 4% of the segment's 2016 net sales. We produce and market water-based hydraulic control fluids for major oil and gas companies, and drilling contractors for offshore deep water production and drilling applications.  Production fluids are used in the control systems that open and close critical valves for the deep water oil extraction and transportation process.  Drilling fluids are used in control systems to operate valves on the ocean floor.  Our current customer base is primarily in the production area of this business, as opposed to drilling and exploration.  Although the recent sharp decline in oil prices has slowed the short-term growth expectations of the oil and gas industry, we believe there is significant long-term growth potential for this business as the industry stabilizes, and as oil is produced from new offshore, sub-sea wells.

Seasonality
The Performance Solutions segment is not subject to significant seasonality.
Agricultural Solutions
Overview
Our Agricultural Solutions segment is based on a solutions-oriented business model that focuses on product innovation to address an ever-increasing need for higher crop yield and quality. We offer to growers diverse crop protection solutions from weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides) and diseases (fungicides), in foliar and seed treatment applications. We also offer a wide variety of proven BioSolutions, including biostimulants, which stimulate plant growth and reproductive development, innovative nutrition, which optimizes the nutrition of plants, and biocontrol products, such as bioinsecticides and biofungicides, which perform the same task as conventional crop protection products without chemical residues.  We emphasize farmer economics and food safety by combining, when possible, BioSolutions with crop protection and seed treatment agrochemicals. Our Agricultural Solutions segment employs approximately 3,300 personnel with a significant presence in high-growth regions such as Africa, South Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe.
With products to address every stage of the plant life-cycle, Agricultural Solutions aims to outperform the crop protection chemistry market by focusing on high-growth, high-value and high-differentiation (H3). In line with these objectives, in 2016, our Agricultural Solutions segment launched a "H3 Priority Segments" program, which focuses on five priority segments selected for their potential to deliver accelerated growth and sustained profitability due to their strong solutions orientation. We believe that each of these H3 Priority Segments, which are listed below, is a high growth and high value segment that demonstrates a high potential for differentiation:
5


Crop Establishment: | Focuses on seed treatment and in-furrow applications to protect the crop in its early stages. 
Plant Stress and Stimulation: | Helps the metabolism of the plant deal with abiotic stresses such as drought and cold, while stimulating it to enhance yields through the use of biostimulants and other solutions. 
Resistant Weed Management: | Develops solutions to manage weed resistance of widely used herbicides such as glyphosate. 
Specialty Protection Niches: | Creates solutions to fight against niche pests in underserved segments such as mites or bacteria. 
Crop Residue Management: | Develops standalone biocontrol solutions or combinations of biocontrol with conventional crop protection to help growers to effectively manage residue levels in fruits & vegetables and address evolving food chain requirements.

Additionally, we manage key, strategic products globally. Our global portfolio includes our Global Value Added Portfolio, or GVAP, and our Global BioSolutions Portfolio, or GBP. Our GVAP consists of agrochemicals in the herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and seed treatment categories, based on patented or proprietary off-patent AIs, including products derived from AIs for which we have a strong market position due to differentiated product offerings or supply relationships. Our GBP includes biostimulants, innovative nutrition and biocontrol products. We consider our GVAP and GBP to be key pillars for our sustainable growth in the H3 Priority Segments.  In addition, the segment offers certain non-crop products, including animal health products, such as honey bee protective miticides and certain veterinary vaccines.
Our dedicated sales force works with growers and distributors to promote the use of our solutions throughout a crop’s growth cycle, focusing on the H3 Priority Segments and also addressing selective local opportunities through tailored solutions to complete our offering and cover underserved needs in those markets.  
We remain focused on expanding our presence in worldwide targeted markets by developing or acquiring crop protection products and obtaining registrations for new products, new uses for existing products and uses of existing products in new countries.  
Products
Our Agricultural Solutions segment offers a wide variety of proven crop solutions to growers comprising five major global product lines: fungicides and biofungicides; herbicides; insecticides, bioinsecticides and acaricides; biostimulants and innovative nutrition; and seed treatments:

Fungicides and Biofungicides: | Fungicides prevent the spread of fungi and other diseases in crops. Biofungicides perform the same task as conventional fungicides, without chemical residues. Our fungicides and biofungicides products include Evito, Fortix, Proplant and Vacciplant. 
Herbicides: | Herbicides are used to control unwanted plants while leaving the targeted crops to grow unharmed. We produce total and selective herbicides with a variety of formulations for many temperate and tropical crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, soybeans and onions. Our main herbicide products are Dinamic, Everest, Pantera and Select. 
Insecticides, Bioinsecticides and Acaricides: | Our insecticides, such as Cythrin Max, Orthene and Talisma, are products used against insect pests at different stages of the pest life cycle, from egg and larvae to nymph and adult. These products can have both crop and public health applications. Bioinsecticides, such as Carpovirosine, perform the same task as conventional insecticides, without chemical residues. Acaricides or miticides control a variety of mite pests on crops. These products are primarily targeted at tree fruit and nut, vine, ornamental and selected row crop applications for effective mite control programs. Our main miticide products, such as Acramite, Floramite and Omite, are sold globally. 
Biostimulants and Innovative Nutrition: | As a leader in the high-growth and high-value biostimulants and innovative nutrition segment, our biostimulants and innovative nutrition portfolio includes a wide range of products, which are often tailored to meet different needs of growers. Our biostimulants stimulate plant growth and reproductive development. Our innovative nutrition products optimize the nutrition of plants. This portfolio is highly differentiated and primarily protected by trade secrets. Our biostimulant products include Biozyme, BM Start and Appetizer. Our innovative nutrition products include Foltron and Poliquel. 
Seed Treatments: | As a leader in the high-growth and high-value seed treatment industry, our diverse portfolio encompasses pioneer products, such as Rancona and Vitavax. Our seed treatments are applied before planting by coating the seed in order to protect it during germination and protect the plant during its initial growth phases. We anticipate growth in seed treatments as a result of the increasing use of higher-value genetically-modified seeds. 

6

Our product offering also includes regional off-patent AIs that complement our global portfolio. In addition, we offer certain non-crop products, including animal health products, such as honey bee protective miticides and certain veterinary vaccines.  Apivar, a global miticide for the protection of bees against the Varroa mite, is one of our main honey bee health products.
Seasonality
The agrochemical business is seasonal in nature and corresponds to agricultural cycles within each region in which we operate. The geographic spread of our products can result in significant variations in earnings and cash flow during such cycles.  Agrochemical and BioSolutions sales typically begin ahead of the growing season and peak in the middle of the season.  In the northern hemisphere, farmers purchase the majority of their agrochemical inputs during the first half of the year from distributors which we start to supply during the latter part of the fourth quarter.  Growers in the southern hemisphere purchase the majority of their products in the second half of the year.  As a result, we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in quarterly sales.  For example, due to the size of our market in Latin America, we typically generate greater net sales in the second half of the calendar year and our net sales tend to be lower during the first half of each calendar year.
Weather conditions and natural disasters such as heavy rains, hurricanes, hail, floods, tornadoes, freezing conditions, drought, or fire also affect decisions by our customers and end-users about the types and amounts of agrochemical and BioSolutions products to purchase and the timing of use of such products.  For example, an early spring in Europe can bring forward sales from the second quarter into the first quarter.  The high degree of correlation between sales patterns and unpredictable weather conditions makes drawing conclusions from quarterly sales difficult.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to our ongoing success:

• | “Asset-Lite, High-Touch” Business Model. We are building our business through the acquisition and integration of “Asset-Lite, High-Touch” businesses. These are businesses evidenced by high margins and low capital expenditures which translates into high cash flow returns on capital. Over 40% of our employees are in either technological innovation or sales and services areas; hence “high-touch.” Our commitment to technological innovation and our extensive intellectual property portfolio enables us to develop our cutting-edge products. In order to continue to provide innovative products and highly specialized technical service to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining an expert and qualified employee base. Our business involves the formulation of a broad range of specialty chemicals, created by blending raw materials or developing new uses for existing AIs. This model allows us to conservatively manage our investments in fixed assets to both maintain and grow the business. Our existing fixed asset base is modern and well-maintained and, accordingly, requires low capital expenditures for maintenance. 


• | Industry Leading Positions. Our businesses strategically focus on acquiring and maintaining leading positions in niche sectors of high-growth markets by offering high value-added services that are indispensable to our customers. We believe our scale and global reach in product development, marketing and formulation provides us with advantages over many of our competitors, allowing us to maintain strong market share positions and drive profitable growth. Our leadership positions contribute to our ability to attract new customers and successfully enter new end-markets. 


• | Broad Diversified Business. We offer a broad range of products and services to diverse and often unrelated end-markets, ranging from agricultural, electronics, industrial, and offshore oil and gas production and drilling to consumer packaging and printing. Our proprietary technology, service-oriented business model, high barriers to entry and significant customer switching costs have allowed us to achieve stable and compelling margins while protecting our market share. We believe the diversity of the niche end-markets we serve will enable us to continue our growth and maintain strong cash flow generation throughout economic cycles. The diversification will also help mitigate the impact of a downturn in any single industry, end-market or region. 


• | Strong Expertise in Registration and Distribution. Product registration is complex and crucial, particularly in the agrochemical space. Our Agricultural Solutions segment has a large team of specialists dedicated to the regulatory process across various jurisdictions, and we believe we are well experienced in obtaining and defending the required registrations for our products in each country in which they are sold and for each crop on which they are applied. Once obtained, these registrations provide a right to use a product for a specified crop in that country or region for a number of years. In addition, our Agricultural Solutions segment has a strong network of distributors, which currently reaches over 100 countries and jurisdictions. Our large distribution network enables us to focus on profitable niche applications, which we believe are less sensitive to competitive pricing pressures. This distribution network, together with our geographical footprint, also allows us to attract licensing and resale opportunities from partner companies for new products, technologies and applications. 

7


• | Comprehensive Product Offering. We provide our customers with a comprehensive offering of products that meet many of their specialty chemical needs. In many cases we offer a full suite of products with complementary capabilities that provide a complete functional solution to the customer. We believe the ability to provide a “top-to-bottom” product offering is a significant competitive advantage over many of our smaller and regional competitors. Our existing product offerings also offer many opportunities for growth in adjacent end-markets. 


• | Performance-Driven Culture and Board with Proven Track Record. We believe we have outstanding people who can deliver superior performance under the tutelage and oversight of proven and experienced leadership. Our culture is performance focused and driven by empowering team members and then holding them accountable for their outcomes. We measure people on financial results, safety, customer satisfaction and commitments, legal compliance and environmental stewardship. We measure our performance against benchmarks and drive operational excellence through continuous improvement. Our experienced management team is complemented by an experienced Board, which includes individuals with a proven track record of successfully acquiring and managing businesses. Our business segments are also led by executives that have extensive experience in their respective fields. 

Business Strategies
Our primary goal is to create value by driving cash flow per share through profitable organic sales growth while continuing to improve our cost structure. We seek to develop and engineer new products and processes, leverage our global scale to enter new markets and optimally manage our existing portfolio of specialty chemical businesses. Our efforts are directed by the following key business strategies:

• | Build a Best-in-Class Specialty Chemical Company. Our goal is to build a best-in-class, global formulator, marketer and distributor of specialty chemical products. We anticipate that the fragmented nature of the specialty chemical market will continue to provide opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. We believe that our combined company provides a strong platform on which to grow our business and expand our market shares in key geographic markets. 


• | Expand our Core Businesses. We believe that we can capitalize on our previous Acquisitions to further enhance our technical capabilities, sophisticated process know-how, solutions orientation, strong customer relationships and deep industry knowledge. We expect that the Acquisitions will enhance our growth by extending our products breadth and expanding the international reach. We intend to extend many of our product offerings through the development of new applications for our existing products or through synergistic combinations, and to target those geographies with attractive market fundamentals where our strengths in marketing, portfolio development, regulation and customer education can add value for our customers. 


• | Enhancing Product Innovation. We place a strong emphasis on innovation. New products are developed and created by drawing upon our significant intellectual property portfolio and technical expertise. Building on our core competencies in product innovation, applications development and technical services, we intend to drive organic growth by reaching new high-growth markets and expanding upon our existing technologies to develop new products for adjacent markets. 


• | Leverage Customer Relationships. We intend to continue to leverage our close customer relationships to execute our growth strategy by working directly with our customers to identify opportunities for new products. We also have strong collaborative relationships with OEMs who specify which specialty materials, chemistries and technologies they need in their products. Working directly with our customers allows us to increase OEM qualification of our products and identify opportunities to grow with our customers. Such close customer relationships also provide a solid barrier to entry for competition. 


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our founder, Martin E. Franklin, and our Chief Executive Officer, Rakesh Sachdev, have significant experience and expertise, and have been highly successful, in acquiring, integrating and growing value-added businesses. We intend to pursue further acquisitions as a way to enhance our growth and strategic position. We intend to focus primarily on businesses that share our “Asset-Lite, High-Touch” philosophy, with product offerings that provide geographic or product diversification. We expect to achieve commercial and distribution efficiencies by expanding into related categories that can be marketed through our existing distribution channels or provide us with new distribution channels for our existing products. We plan to only pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe meet our acquisition criteria and when we deem it to be financially prudent. 


• | Focus on Human Capital. The success of our business depends on our ability to continue to capitalize on our technical capabilities, unique process know-how, strong customer relationships and industry knowledge. Our technical expertise and history of innovation demonstrated by the employees we acquired in the Acquisitions reflect the specialized and highly skilled nature of our research and development personnel. As such we intend to focus on attracting, retaining and developing the best human capital across all levels of our organization, which is key to our ability to successfully operate and grow our business.

Customers
We have a diverse customer base, as we sell our products either directly to end-user customers or through intermediaries, such as independent, third-party distributors (national, regional, or local), agricultural cooperatives, retailers, and government agencies.  We also have collaborative relationships with many OEMs, who specify to us which specialty materials, chemistries and technologies are used in their products. The majority of our sales are through such intermediaries.
Within each segment, we rely on independent distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. We believe that we are able to attract new customers successfully through our international reach, coupled with our local knowledge and presence, which enables us to meet the needs of our customers through a global network of 59 manufacturing sites, 12 sites that include manufacturing and research facilities, 16 stand-alone research centers, and a direct sales force in nearly 70 countries. Our flexible manufacturing base allows for "just in time" supply chain management. We operate a relatively large number of small and medium-sized facilities located close to our customers throughout the world's major economic regions. This close proximity to our global customers' local sites enables access to all key growth markets.
We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer.  Although no customer or distributor constitutes 10% or more of our consolidated net sales, we do have some customers and distributors, the loss of which may impair our results of operations, for certain business lines, for the affected earnings periods.  
Selling & Marketing 
We employ a large customer-centric sales and marketing force of professionals worldwide.  These professionals have strong technical expertise, local market knowledge and intimate customer relationships.  Our local sales and marketing teams closely monitor their market trends and maintain active dialogue with our customers to assess and understand their constantly evolving challenges.  We use this feedback from our local sales teams to anticipate future needs, respond rapidly to changing market conditions, and deliver customized, value-added solutions for our customers.  This feedback loop is an important source of new product ideas and helps guide our capital allocation decisions.  We leverage local market intelligence to develop new and innovative products that are then marketed by our local sales and marketing teams throughout the markets we serve.
Performance Solutions
In our Performance Solutions segment, methods for selling and marketing our proprietary products vary slightly by geographic region.  In total, we generate business through the efforts of sales, technical and service personnel and regional distributors.  In the Americas, we employ sales, administrative and service personnel to market our entire line of proprietary products.  In certain areas of the Americas, distributors also sell and service many of our products.  In Europe, sales, administrative and service representatives, who are employed by our subsidiaries located in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey, market our proprietary products.  In the Asia-Pacific region, our local subsidiaries employ sales, administrative and service representatives to market our proprietary products through either subsidiaries or branches in Australia, mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.  In addition to the countries where we have wholly owned subsidiaries, some of our proprietary chemistries are sold in other countries throughout Asia, Europe and South America through distributors.
Agricultural Solutions
In our Agricultural Solutions segment, our products are sold in over 100 countries globally and reach our grower-customers and the ultimate end-users through a wide variety of market channels.  Our sales, marketing, and go-to-market strategies vary significantly by region and depend to a large extent on the existing distribution infrastructure and market practices in each particular region.  Depending upon the customer’s location, we work with national and regional distributors, retailers, co-ops, government entities, and growers to promote our solutions.  We also have loyalty programs in place for distributors and engage in active grower education to promote our products and brands.  Because of our global presence and local capabilities, other agrochemical and crop protection companies enter into exclusive distribution rights agreements with us.  Such agreements give us the exclusive right to distribute their products in, or with respect to, specified territories, crops, applications, channels, and formulations.
In the larger and more mature North American market, we rely more heavily on an extensive existing distribution network.  The North American distributor landscape is one of the most consolidated.  In Asia, Europe and Latin America, sales and marketing are conducted through a mix of national and regional distributors, retailers, co-ops, and growers (primarily large farmers).
9

Africa and Middle East represent our most unique region from a sales and marketing perspective due to relatively lower levels of existing distribution infrastructure.  In many cases, growers in this region require additional customer outreach and education as our products and the agronomic techniques to apply them are relatively new to this market.  In order to address these challenges, we have developed an extensive regional distribution network to enable us to efficiently deliver our products, and products of our distribution partners, to the growers. 
Employees
In order to ensure that we are able to continue to provide innovative products and highly technical service to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining a highly specialized and qualified employee base.  As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 7,750 full-time employees in approximately 70 countries, including approximately 3,200 research and development chemists, experienced technical service, and sales personnel. 
In addition, many of our full-time employees are employed outside the United States.  In certain countries where we operate, our employees are also members of unions or are represented by works councils as required by law.  We are required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these unions and/or works councils for any changes to our activities or employee benefits, which may impact our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes.
Our management believes that our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining unions are satisfactory.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development ensures that we remain ahead of emerging trends, delivering solutions to strengthen our leadership positions in terms of innovation and product development in our market niches. Our research and development activities are also focused on developing products, and improving formulations and processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations.  We accelerate market introductions and increase the impact of our product offerings through collaboration with partners in the commercial sector (customers and value chain partners) and by working with distributors, OEMs, governments and local communities around the world. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. 
Performance Solutions
With respect to our Performance Solutions segment, research in connection with proprietary products is performed principally in Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan and the United States. During 2016, the segment's research and development expenses totaled $45.0 million. Substantially all research and development activity was performed internally. 
Agricultural Solutions
Within our Agricultural Solutions segment, our global and regional marketing teams conduct a rigorous process for identifying key AIs with proven technical efficacy, which can be brought to market through our formulation, marketing, and distribution capabilities, in order to address strategic gaps in our portfolio.  During 2016, the segment invested $36.4 million in product registrations and incurred $39.4 million of research and development costs. 
Competitive Environment
Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject to rapid changes in technology. Broadly speaking, we compete in the specialty chemicals market.  On a more narrow scale, we compete in markets for specialty chemicals for agrochemicals, electronic applications, general metal and plastic finishing, oil and gas exploration and production, and printing. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to promoting and selling certain products.
The competitive environment of each of our segments is described below:
Performance Solutions
Our Performance Solutions segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly competes within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc., The Dow Chemical Company, across its industrial and electronics chemicals businesses, as well as Asahi, Senju, Tamura, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, and Flint Group. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, 
10

technology, performance, reliability, brand, reputation, range of products and services, and service and support. We maintain extensive support, technical and testing services for our customers, and are continuously developing new products. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such as the merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and The Dow Chemical Company, could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels. However, we believe that our combined abilities to manufacture, sell, service and develop new products and applications, enable us to compete successfully both locally and internationally. Some large competitors operate globally, as we do, but most operate only locally or regionally. We also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete.
Agricultural Solutions
The agrochemical sector is a highly developed and competitive industry with a wide range of established competitors that offer a broad variety of competing products.  Our main competitors include major multinational agrochemical companies which engage in basic research for AI discovery, such as BASF, Bayer CropScience AG, and Syngenta AG, as well as a number of Japanese participants. We also face competition from a variety of off-patent agrochemical companies worldwide, including FMC Corporation, ADAMA Agricultural Solutions Ltd., United Phosphorus Ltd., and Nufarm Limited, among others.
The BioSolutions sector is a newer and less mature industry than agrochemicals. There is significantly less direct competition among providers given the highly differentiated, proprietary nature of BioSolutions products. However, we do compete with BioSolutions providers that have similar product claims and offer potential functional substitutes for our products. Customer education and corresponding demand creation is a critical element of competing in the BioSolutions sector. Customer acceptance and adoption levels may vary widely. It is a very fragmented market, with the participation of companies that do not necessarily compete in the agrochemical space. Our current competitors include Stoller S.A., Novozymes Biopharma A/S, Verdesian LifeSciences, LLC, Bayer CropScience AG (AgraQuest, Inc.), Valagro SpA, BASF SE (Becker Underwood Inc.), Plant Health Care plc and various others. 
Order Backlog
Due to the relatively short cycle times in our business, our order backlog levels are minimal.  In general, we do not formulate our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Raw Materials and Sourcing of Products
In our Performance Solutions segment, we use a variety of specialty and commodity chemicals in our manufacturing processes.  Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis.  We typically purchase our major raw materials on an as-needed basis from outside sources.
In our Agricultural Solutions segment, we rely on external contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components for our products.  There is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards and regulatory requirements.  With one minor exception, we engage in no direct agrochemical AI manufacturing.  We source virtually all of our AIs from third-party manufacturers, which represent a limited number of key suppliers for AIs.  We strive to maintain multiple supply sources for each AI; however, in certain instances, there is only a single registered source of AIs for important products where there is currently no viable alternative source. Our goal is to maximize our sourcing of raw materials, especially AIs, from quality suppliers in countries with generally low manufacturing costs, such as China, Eastern Europe, and India, or markets with good raw material positions.
We formulate and package our products in-house or through tolling and other third-party manufacturing and formulation arrangements.  We balance our in-house formulation with third-party arrangements to limit our exposure to utilization drop-offs, facility closures, and certain manufacturing-related environmental risks which helps us to optimize our cost structure.
Within certain portions of our BioSolutions portfolio, we manage an end-to-end supply chain.  We purchase natural raw materials, such as plant extracts and seaweed, to extract AIs for our BioSolutions products.

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Products
Our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are important to our business and are protected by a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, data exclusivity, and other marketing exclusivity rights, exclusive or semi-exclusive manufacturing arrangements, and other non-patent strategies. We seek intellectual property and other proprietary rights in major markets and other commercially-relevant jurisdictions worldwide. We implement confidentiality procedures and contractual exclusivity and seek other rights necessary to protect our intellectual property, proprietary formulations, processes, and other product-related rights.  We rely on trade secrets and know-how confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, natural product composition/origin, and formulations. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements, when applicable, with our employees, consultants, contractors, and other third-parties who may be engaged in discovery or development of intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Finally, we seek to include provisions in our material transfer agreements, license and development agreements, and other agreements that provide for the transfer of intellectual property rights back to us to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances of any specific transaction and development project.
Performance Solutions
In our Performance Solutions segment, as of December 31, 2016, we owned, had applications pending, or licensed the rights to approximately 1,800 domestic and foreign patents.  The patents we hold are important to our business and have remaining lives of varying duration.  Although certain of these patents are becoming increasingly more important, we believe that our ability to provide technical and testing services to our customers and meet their rapid delivery requirements is equally, if not more, important to our business.  No specific group or groups of intellectual property rights are material to our business.  However, we have many proprietary products which are not covered by patents and which are responsible for a large component of our total sales.  Further, we hold a number of domestic and foreign trade names and trademark registrations and applications for registration, which we consider to be of value in identifying our products.  We do not hold nor have we granted any franchises or concessions.
Agricultural Solutions
In our Agricultural Solutions segment, as of December 31, 2016, we owned, had applications pending, licensed or had freedom-to-operate rights under, approximately 200 domestic and foreign patents, and approximately 7,000 product registrations.  As part of our intellectual property strategy, we in-license patents from other agrochemical and BioSolutions companies and pursue other patents not related to composition of matter, such as use extensions, formulations, mixtures and manufacturing processes. We also differentiate our AIs with value-added mixtures and novel formulations, with launches prior to the expiration of the AIs' patent protection, in order to avoid a potential price erosion and loss of share. A significant portion of our patent portfolio consists of patents relating to amicarbazone, flucarbazone and fluoxastrobin, three of our key GVAP AIs. Our patents covering manufacturing processes, methods of use, and combinations with other AIs, safeners, or other adjuvants of these three GVAP AIs are scheduled to expire in commercially relevant markets at various times before the end of 2020 for amicarbazone; 2022 for flucarbazone; and 2024 for fluoxastrobin.  With respect to fluoxastrobin, we have a pending application in the United States covering a manufacturing process which we intend to file in other countries as well, which, if granted, will expire no sooner than 2036. We believe this new process will contribute to lower costs for the manufacture of fluoxastrobin, which would represent a significant competitive advantage over potential generic entrants. 
Other proprietary rights protection
Some products that have already lost patent protection but have originally been registered by a company are often referred to as proprietary off-patent products, especially if the company holds a significant share of the AI. These are often characterized by a substantial degree of differentiation through formulation and product package offerings responsive to grower needs. Proprietary off-patent products enable providers to maintain a stronger market position and a differentiated margin profile, which may be further enhanced by specialized market access, a strong brand, or a competitive cost position. In addition, while they are not protected by patents, proprietary off-patent products require registrations in every country for every crop and AI that will be sold. Our strong registration capabilities provide us with the ability to effectively maintain and defend our existing registrations as well as to acquire new registrations in a cost effective and timely manner.
Proprietary off-patent products can benefit from other barriers to entry designed to reward the company which first registers an AI in a certain geography, following significant investments in regulatory data to support that initial registration, with an exclusive period of sales  (“exclusive use”) and, after the exclusive use period has expired, an additional period of financial compensation from other companies which request access to the data developed by the original company (“data compensation”) to obtain a registration of that same AI in that geography.  These barriers to entry are established in multiple jurisdictions, including Brazil, Canada, the E.U. and the United States. 
12

Our global portfolio is composed of multiple proprietary off-patent products including: acephate; amitraz; ipconazole; diflubenzuron; bifenazate; clethodim; and propargite and cypermethrin for the E.U. Many of our proprietary off-patent AIs are currently benefiting from exclusive use and data compensation provisions.
Government and Environmental Regulation
We develop, produce and market our chemical products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to numerous federal, regional and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  These regulations govern the Company’s manufacture, use, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of chemicals and hazardous substances, which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards. We are required to meet these strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent. However, no portion of our business is subject to re-negotiation of profits or termination of material contracts or subcontracts at the election of the governments in the countries in which we operate.
We are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage.  Our reliance on independent distributors to sell some of our proprietary chemicals internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity, because these distributors could be deemed to be our agents, and we could be held responsible for their actions.  We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the 2011 Bribery Act, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery.  These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature and, as a result, we may be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof.  We maintain a Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, applicable to all our directors and employees. In addition, our CEO, CFO and CAO are bound by the provisions of a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. The Policy and Code of Ethics were both approved by our Board and cover compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws, as well as other legal areas applicable to our operations.
As a manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals and systems, we are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated properties and occupational safety and health matters.  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly. We expect that the trend of increased regulation will continue in the future. We have and may in the future incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines and sanctions and third-party claims for property or natural resource damage or personal injuries as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations.  As of December 31, 2016, we believe we had appropriate liabilities recorded for our various environmental matters.
Our business and our customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (or REACH). REACH, adopted in December 2006, imposes obligations on E.U. manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the E.U. to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments.
Active substances and co-formulants used in plant protection products (pesticides) are generally exempt from REACH as they are considered as already registered under the Plant Protection Products Directive 91/414/EEC.  However, certain exceptions may apply that would require the active substance or co-formulant to be registered, particularly if the substance has a non-plant protection use.  While we have registered and continue to register substances as required, the registration process is lengthy and registration of certain of our substances may not be immediately effective.  The cost estimates could vary based on the number of substances requiring registration, data availability and cost.  The implementation of the REACH registration process may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products in the future.
In response to increased government attention to environmental matters worldwide, we continue to develop proprietary products designed to reduce the discharge of pollutant materials into the environment and eliminate the use of certain targeted raw materials while enhancing the efficiency of customer chemical processes.
