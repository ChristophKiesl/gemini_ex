Item 1.     Business
Overview
 
We operate in the gold mining industry, primarily focused on advancing the Donlin Gold project in Alaska. The Donlin Gold project is held by Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), a limited liability company owned equally by wholly-owned subsidiaries of NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”).
 
We do not produce gold or any other minerals, and do not currently generate operating earnings. Funding to explore our mineral properties and to operate the Company was acquired primarily through previous equity financings consisting of public offerings of our common shares and warrants and through debt financing consisting of convertible notes, and the sale of assets. We expect to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings, through the exercise of stock options, and otherwise.
 
We were incorporated by memorandum of association on December 5, 1984, under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia) as 1562756 Nova Scotia Limited. On January 14, 1985, we changed our name to NovaCan Mining Resources (l985) Limited and on March 20, 1987, we changed our name to NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. On May 29, 2013, our shareholders approved the continuance of the corporation into British Columbia. Subsequently, we filed the necessary documents in Nova Scotia and British Columbia, and we continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) effective as of June 10, 2013. The current addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers of our offices are:

Human Capital Resources
 
On November 30, 2020, we had 13 full-time employees, of which four are located in Canada and nine are located in the United States. We also use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering, and corporate governance.
Company Values 
 
Our company culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Empowering every employee to be their best, affording every employee the opportunity to make a difference, and giving every employee a chance to be heard are core Company values. Our values extend to the communities in which we work. We have adopted a Human Rights Policy focused on our commitment to having a positive influence in the communities where we operate which includes ensuring that we respect human rights.
Diversity 
 
As of the end of fiscal year 2020, 46% of our total workforce were women. Selection of individuals for executive and other positions with the Company is guided by the Company’s policy which “prohibits discrimination in any aspect of employment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or age.” Our Board and management acknowledge the importance of all aspects of diversity including gender, ethnic origin, business skills and experience, because it is right to do so and because it is good for our business. When considering candidates for executive positions, the Board’s evaluation considers the broadest possible assessment of each candidate’s skills and background with the overriding objective of ensuring that we have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, and capacity that it needs to be successful. In the context of this overriding objective, we have determined not to set targets for the percentage of women, or other aspects of diversity, in executive officer positions.
Safety and Health
 
NOVAGOLD’s primary objective is to ensure the health and safety of its employees, partners, and contractors, and is reflected in its Health and Safety Policy. The Company has implemented COVID-19 policies at its offices in Salt Lake City and Vancouver designed to ensure the safety and well-being of all employees and the people associated with them. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce risk, our employees have been asked to work remotely, avoid all non-essential travel, adhere to good hygiene practices, and engage in physical distancing. Our focus on safety is also reflected at Donlin Gold LLC. As discussed in more detail under Recent Developments, Donlin Gold LLC has established a wide-ranging set of policies have been implemented at the Donlin Gold project site and Anchorage office designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Recent Developments
 
Donlin Gold FS 
 
NOVAGOLD engaged Wood Canada Limited (Wood) to perform a detailed review of the costs used in the Donlin Gold FS (as defined in Item 2. below) to meet the Company’s reporting requirements.  Based on that cost review, Wood determined that updating the Donlin Gold FS using 2020 costs and new gold price guidance results in no material change to the mineral resources or mineral reserves. Therefore, the Donlin Gold FS is considered current and supportive of the scientific and technical information summarized in this Form 10-K that was derived from that report. Wood is currently updating all sections of the Donlin Gold FS with updated costs, economic assessment, permitting information, and technical information related to permitting, generated on the Donlin Gold project since 2011. NOVAGOLD intends to file the updated Technical Report on EDGAR at www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com during 2021. The updated Donlin Gold FS does not incorporate the latest Donlin Gold optimization work on the geologic modeling concepts or other optimization work since these assessments are still underway.
 
COVID-19 response and community engagement
 
As noted above, NOVAGOLD’s primary objective is to ensure the health and safety of its employees, partners and contractors. The Company has implemented policies at its offices in Salt Lake City and Vancouver designed to ensure the safety and well-being of all employees and the people associated with them. In that regard, to reduce risk, our employees have been asked to work remotely, avoid all non-essential travel, adhere to good hygiene practices, and engage in physical distancing.
 
At Donlin Gold LLC, with dedicated community partners in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region, who share the objective of protecting the health of Donlin Gold’s employees and contractors, a wide-ranging set of policies have been implemented at the Donlin Gold project site and Anchorage office this year designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The plan included: testing of all employees and contractors visiting the Donlin Gold project site; utilizing charters to safely deliver employees to and from camp to minimize in-region travel; screening and physical distancing measures while at camp; more frequent sanitization practices; and increased communication around hygiene and sanitization practices, as well as identification of symptoms.

Donlin Gold LLC also responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with urgently needed community support, including delivery of food and supplies to 56 villages in the Y-K region, alongside its Native Corporation partners Calista Corporation (“Calista”) and The Kuskokwim Corporation (TKC), owners of the project’s subsurface and surface rights respectively. Despite this year’s challenges, Donlin Gold maintained community engagement programs related to environmental management, safety, training, educational, health and cultural initiatives.
Donlin Gold project 
 
In 2020, Donlin Gold LLC completed an 85-hole drilling program totaling approximately 23,400 meters in both the ACMA and Lewis deposit areas. The primary objective of the program, the largest such campaign at Donlin Gold since 2008, was to validate recent geologic modeling concepts and testing for extensions of high-grade zones in both intrusive (igneous) and sedimentary rocks. Assay results received to-date from the 2020 drilling program have shown areas with higher grades observed over thinner intervals compared to those predicted by previous modeling, particularly in sedimentary rocks.
 
For further information, see section Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
 
Reclamation
 
We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. In addition, financial assurance acceptable to the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over reclamation must be provided in an amount that the authority determines to be sufficient to allow the authority to implement the reclamation plan in the event that the project owners fail to complete the work as provided in the plan.
Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Our exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, disclosure requirements and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in the United States and Canada. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. For a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations, see section Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise, and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to obtain the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
Most aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, resource estimating, metallurgy, mine planning, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, engineering, construction and operation of a mine, financing, legal, accounting, investor relations, and community relations. Historically, we have found that we can locate and retain appropriate employees and consultants and we believe we will continue to be able to do so.
 
The raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in the United States and Canada. Historically, we have been able to secure the appropriate equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business can be seasonal as our mineral exploration and development activities take place in southwestern Alaska. Due to the northern climate, work on the Donlin Gold project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface work often is limited to late spring through early fall, although work in some locations is more readily and efficiently completed during the winter months when the ground is frozen.

Gold Price History
 
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand, in addition to international and national political and economic conditions.
