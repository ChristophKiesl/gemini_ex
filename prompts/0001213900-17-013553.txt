ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 29, 1988 under the name Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. (“Cine-Source Entertainment”). Pursuant to a Plan of Merger dated February 24, 2004, on such date, Cine-Source Entertainment filed the Articles and Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado merging Cine-Source Entertainment into Cine-Source, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Cine-Source”), with Cine-Source as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). A previous controlling stockholder group of Cine-Source Entertainment arranged the Merger for business reasons that did not materialize. On April 26, 2004, Cine-Source effectuated a 1-for-200 reverse stock split. Thereafter, on April 27, 2004, Cine-Source changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc. (“FQV Colorado”). On April 13, 2006, FQV Colorado formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of Nevada under the name First Quantum Ventures, Inc. (“FQV Nevada”), and on May 5, 2006, FQV Colorado merged with and into its subsidiary, FQV Nevada, with FQV Nevada as the surviving corporation.
 
On March 15, 2012, FQV Nevada changed its name to DiMi Telematics International, Inc. (“DTII”). On April 16, 2012, DTII issued a 1-for-1 stock dividend to current stockholders whereby DTII issued an additional 33,959,744 shares of common stock.  On May 16, 2012, DTII issued an additional 1-for-1 stock dividend to current stockholders whereby an additional 71,286,155 shares of common stock were issued. The dividends were also applied to outstanding warrants.  The foregoing dividends have been retroactively reflected in the financial statements as splits.

In early 2017, our management team elected to suspend further investment and working capital on developing the DTII’s technology and business prospects, turning its attention to prevailing new business opportunities in other high growth industries; namely the hemp-derived cannabidiol (“CBD”) market. On March 10, 2017, DTII changed its name to Bespoke Extracts, Inc. to align the Company’s corporate identity with its new business plan. 
 
The Company is now focused on introducing a proprietary line of premium quality, all natural cannabidiol (CBD) products in the form of tinctures and capsules for the nutraceutical and veterinary markets. Produced using pure, all natural, zero-THC phytocannabinoid-rich (“PCR”) hemp-derived CBD, our products will be marketed as dietary supplements and distributed through our direct-to-consumers ecommerce store, found at www.BespokeExtracts.com, and through select specialty retailers, pharmacies/dispensaries and care providers.
 
The Cannabis Market
 
Many states have already legalized medical cannabis, and adult-use cannabis is now legal at the statewide level in several major U.S. markets. According to ArcView Market Research, a cannabis industry research firm, the cannabis industry will be worth roughly $21.8 billion per year by 2020. Investment firm Cowen & Co. is projecting that U.S. legal cannabis sales could reach $50 billion by 2026. For context, according to a report by Arcview Market Research, the North American black market for cannabis is estimated to have totaled $46.4 billion in sales last year.
 
CBD, one of over 80 active cannabinoid chemicals found in cannabis, is the major non-psychoactive component of the plant Cannabis sativa L., and is proving to be an effective treatment for a number of health conditions affecting adults, children and pets. While U.S. companies cannot legally make medical claims about CBD or its uses, there are countless scientific research studies showing potential therapeutic indications for CBD, demonstrating that it works well with body cells to improve immunity and is even produced naturally in the human brain.
 
According to a 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, CBD benefits including acting in some experimental models as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, antiemetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent; and is therefore a potential medicinal treatment for neuroinflammation, epilepsy, oxidative injury, vomiting and nausea, anxiety and schizophrenia. Moreover, there have been dozens of other peer-reviewed studies suggesting that CBD may have therapeutic value for medical indications including bipolar disorder, cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Huntington’s Disease, Crohn’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease, PTSD, rheumatoid arthritis and Tourette’s Syndrome. 
 
Due to the growing body of published research supporting the promising therapeutic benefits of CBD, the demand for CBD products has been skyrocketing. In fact, Forbes Magazine recently reported that the Hemp Business Journal estimates that the CBD market will grow to a $2.1 billion market in consumer sales by 2020 with $450 million of those sales coming from hemp-based sources, representing a 700% increase from 2016. In 2015, the market for consumer sales of hemp-derived CBD products was $90 million, plus another $112 million in marijuana-derived CBD products which were sold through dispensaries – bringing the total CBD market to $202 million last year. According to an article published in 2016 in Forbes Magazine, Matthew Karnes, founder and Managing Partner of industry research firm, GreenWave Advisors, estimated an almost $3 billion CBD market by 2021. 
 
Introductory Product Line
 
Generally speaking, our management believes most CBD products for oral consumption available on the market have an earthy, bitter taste that some observers suggest is reminiscent of chlorophyll. The centerpiece of Bespoke Extracts’ introductory retail product line is our great-tasting, flavor-infused tinctures, formulated using only premium, organic ingredients. In addition, we will also market CBD extract in capsule form. As our Company matures, we expect to expand our proprietary CBD products to include a much broader range of flavors and form factors.

● | CBD Gelcaps: 1500 mg of all-natural, pure hemp-derived CBD extract in gelcap form – containing 30 gelcaps with 50 mg each. 

Supply, Manufacturing and Logistics
 
Our management believes that some companies operating in the CBD oil industry tend to emphasize sales and quantity over quality and safety. In late February 2015, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued several warning letters to companies who claimed that their products contained CBD but, following testing of these products by the FDA, were found to have no CBD.
 
All of our flavor-infused tinctures and capsules are formulated using pure, all natural, zero-THC phytocannabinoid-rich (“PCR”) hemp-derived CBD sourced from one of the largest, fully and vertically integrated producers of PCR hemp oil. All CBD isolates and oils are authenticated by an independent third party via issuance of a Certificate of Analysis (“COA”), which cannabinoid content and profile, microbiological content, heavy metal content, pesticide content, and residual solvent content. We recognize the importance of compliance and is partnered with one of the industry’s leading CGMP certified extraction facilities. This ensures the consistency and quality of our product line and brand.
 
Through its proprietary engineering process, our American-based supplier isolates and removes any unwanted compounds – while creating the maximum potency level of phytocannabinoids and terpenes – cold, enclosed and continuous manufacturing processes prevents the degradation of natural molecules during extraction and purification. Made and derived from non-GMO, USA-grown hemp, its PCR hemp oil and isolate powder are subjected to a rigorous testing system – both in-house and verified through independent, third party labs – which ensures accurate levels of phytocannabinoids and confirms the absence of THC. Our products contain only the highest level of naturally derived CBD, more than 99.5% pure, and never contain any THC.
 
We believe that a key differentiator of our finished products is the superb quality of ingredients we source from the industry’s leading suppliers, each of whom we have carefully vetted and qualified.
 
For instance, raw Mānuka honey used in our products is imported directly from the north island of New Zealand from a supplier which has been supplying quality bee products since 1974. Mānuka honey is believed to be one of the most unique and beneficial forms of honey in the world and may carry the industry’s highest UMF®16+ rating, distinguishing it as superior high-grade Manuka. Produced by bees that pollinate the native Manuka bush, possible Mānuka honey uses range from healing sore throats and digestive illnesses to curing Staph infections and gingivitis. All other flavorings infused in our products – including our all-natural, organic lemon lime flavor used in our Bespoke Sport offering -- are also sourced from reputable suppliers.
 
Fulfillment of orders from our online customers is managed by a well-established third-party logistics partner.

Development Status and Go-to-Market Strategy
 
Management believes that the traditional retail environment is currently experiencing notable economic instability due largely to the global shift in consumer purchasing behaviors – with online shopping/ecommerce sites rapidly overtaking brick-and-mortar stores as consumer preferred shopping venues. In view of this retailing reality, we have adopted a Direct-to-Consumer sales model that will be anchored by a high impact, visually stunning, content-rich ecommerce website whereby we will educate, sell, and ship our CBD products directly to consumers. In addition, we will also market our CBD products on a wholesale basis to select specialty retailers, dispensaries and physicians.
 
Our marketing initiatives will include the use of social marketing, social influence marketing, direct response marketing, inbound marketing, email marketing, Search Engine Optimization (“SEO”) and content marketing, among other proven strategies to generate and convert sales prospects into loyal, satisfied customers. We will also explore utilizing coupon and deal sites to drive traffic to our website and retailers, as well as participate in select industry conferences to promote our brand and build greater awareness of our products among prospective business partners and consumers.
 
Other planned brand-building tactics include development of an authentic sports marketing and sponsorship strategy focused initially on Extreme Sports, motor racing and other high action sports athletes, teams and events, with the underpinning goal of generating consumer awareness of our high-performance Lemon-Lime Sport CBD brand by fans and athletes.
 
The Difference Between Hemp and Marijuana
 
Both marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant called “Cannabis Sativa L.” However, cultivators of the cannabis plant have manipulated it over the years to encourage specific traits to become dominant. Cannabis plants contain unique compounds called cannabinoids. Current research has revealed over 80 different cannabinoids thus far, but management believes THC is the most well-known and is credited with causing the marijuana high . While marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, hemp contains very little of the psychoactive chemical. The foregoing is one of the differences which distinguishes hemp from marijuana. 
 
Hemp was originally cultivated nearly 10,000 years ago in what is modern day Taiwan. Ancient cultivators of the cannabis plant recognized that it was dioecious, meaning that it had dual characteristics. Cultivators grew one variety of the cannabis plant to be tall and durable. This became what we now call industrial hemp. Upon discovering that the flower buds of the cannabis plant had psychoactive effects, cultivators began separating the hemp plants from the flowering plants in order to isolate their “medicinal” characteristics.
 
Scientifically, we now know that industrial hemp plants tend to produce high levels of the cannabinoid CBD, while producing low amounts of THC. Conversely, the marijuana plant produces high THC levels and low CBD levels. This chemical difference dictates the way we use the cannabis plant for medicinal and dietary supplemental purposes.
 
Market Outlook
 
According to MedMen, a cannabis management services company and investment firm, the legal cannabis market is forecast to be the fastest growing industry in the world, with annual sales projected to hit $80 billion in the next decade. In 2016, the U.S. posted a record $7.1 billion in cannabis sales, up from $5.7 billion in 2015 and $4.6 billion the year before. According to MedMen, this double-digit growth rate is expected to continue in the foreseeable future as more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana. In its December 2016 publication, “The CBD Report,” Hemp Business Journal (“HBJ”) stated that projections indicate that the total CBD market is poised to grow 27% to reach $115 million across all channels. As sales of CBD products continue to increase, HBJ forecasts that the entire U.S. CBD market will increase to $2.1 billion by 2020 and that $450 million of those sales will be from hemp-based sources, and the rest from marijuana sources.
Federal Legislative Overview
 
Cannabidiol, or CBD, that is derived from industrial hemp plants — like the CBD used in all products currently being produced or to be produced by Bespoke Extracts — is deemed by the FDA to be a dietary supplement, not a medication. Consequently, in the U.S., no prescription is required to obtain CBD and it can be legally purchased and consumed in all 50 states (and in 40 countries around the world).

However, in December 2016, the Department of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) implemented a new rule that declared CBD as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.” While numerous industry insiders have expressed concerns about the DEA’s new ruling, it is widely believed that the agency would struggle to make CBD illegal under current laws, thanks to multiple protections put in place by Congress as part of the 2014 Farm Bill. Moreover, subsequent additions to the 2015 and 2016 Congressional Appropriations Act prohibit the DEA from going after the products produced under these programs. Our products have zero THC.
 
On January 27, 2017, House Republican Representative Griffith Morgan from Virginia introduced H.R. 715 to the 115th Congress, which is proposed new legislation that would reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I Controlled Substance and exclude CBD from the definition of marijuana altogether. One month later, House Republican Representative Thomas Garrett of Virginia introduced legislation entitled, Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017 aimed at federally decriminalizing marijuana by removing it from the federal controlled substances list and allowing it to join other industries such as alcohol and tobacco.
 
Competitive Overview
 
Given the rapid growth of the U.S. CBD oil industry, hundreds of companies have entered the market. Simply Googling “CBD Oil Tincture,” the results reveal approximately 745,000 links. Consequently, the market is becoming highly competitive, requiring serious contenders for leadership in the space, like Bespoke Extracts, to execute sound, well defined strategies for optimizing their marketing dollars and ensuring that the quality and integrity of their product offerings remain unimpeachable. While we believe we will prove successful at attaining our financial and operational goals and objectives, certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution, and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness, than us.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
 
Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Professional and General Liability Coverage
 
We maintain professional and general liability insurance policies with third-party insurers on a claims-made basis, subject to deductibles, self-insured retention limits, policy aggregates, exclusions, and other restrictions, in accordance with standard industry practice. We believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, we cannot assure that any pending or future claim will not be successful or if successful will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.
