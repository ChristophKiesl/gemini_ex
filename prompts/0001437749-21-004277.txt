Item 1. Business. 
 
Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) test modules, test contactors, thermal sub-systems, semiconductor automated test equipment and bare board PCB test systems used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services, and revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and PCBs and the products that incorporate them. Our recurring revenues are driven by an increase in the number of semiconductor devices and PCBs that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and technologies by our customers.
 
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”), a Massachusetts-based company. Xcerra, formerly known as LTX-Credence Corporation, is a global provider of test and handling capital equipment, interface products and related services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries. Xcerra operated in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing test markets through its atg-Luther & Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies (ECT), LTX-Credence and Multitest businesses. The acquisition of Xcerra extended Cohu’s market position in the test handler and test contactor markets and expanded Cohu’s addressable market with our entry into semiconductor automated test equipment (ATE) and bare board PCB test. The results of Xcerra’s operations have been included in our consolidated results since October 1, 2018. As a result of the timing of the acquisition, our fiscal 2020 and 2019 results include Xcerra for the entire year whereas fiscal 2018 amounts only include Xcerra for the three months ended December 29, 2018. This acquisition helped transform our business into a broader semiconductor test, inspection and test handling market leader with greater scale, diversification and market opportunities.
 
Management previously determined that Xcerra’s fixtures services business did not align with Cohu’s long-term strategic plan and engaged in a process to divest this portion of the business. As a result, as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the assets of our fixtures business are considered “held for sale” and the operations of our fixtures business were presented as “discontinued operations”. This business was sold in February 2020. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations.
 
We have determined that we have two reportable segments, Semiconductor Test and Inspection Equipment (“Semiconductor Test & Inspection”) and PCB Test Equipment (“PCB Test”). Financial information on our reportable segments for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.

Sales by reportable segment, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated net sales, for the last three years were as follows:
 

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
--------------------------------+------+------+------+------+-----
Semiconductor Test & Inspection | | 92% | | 93% | | 98% 
PCB Test | | 8% | | 7% | | 2% 
 | | 100% | | 100% | | 100%

 
Cohu, Inc. (“Cohu”, “we”, “our”, “us” and the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of California in 1947, as Kalbfell Lab, Inc. and commenced active operations in the same year. Our name was changed to Kay Lab in 1954. In 1957, Cohu was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as Cohu Electronics, Inc. and in 1972 our name was changed to Cohu, Inc.
 
Our Products
 
We currently sell the following products:
 
Semiconductor Test. Semiconductor ATE (Automated Test Equipment) is used both for wafer level and device package testing. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist primarily of two platforms focused on the system on a chip (SoC) device market. The Diamond series platform, which includes the flagship Diamondx test system, offers high-density instrumentation for low-cost testing of microcontrollers, application specific standard products (ASSP), power management, display drivers, sensors and other mixed signal devices. The PAx series of testers is focused primarily on the RF Front End IC and Module market.
Semiconductor Handlers. Semiconductor test handlers are used in conjunction with semiconductor ATE to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including those used in automotive, mobile, industrial, computing applications, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, turret, gravity, strip, MEMS and thermal sub-systems, along with inspection handlers that perform automated optical inspection of semiconductor devices.
Interface Products. Our interface products are comprised of test contactors, probe heads and probe pins. Test contactors serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test such as digital semiconductor devices utilizing spring probe technology, power management and LED semiconductor devices utilizing cantilever technology, and RF semiconductor devices based on contacts designed to operate at high frequencies. Test contactors and probe heads are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently and increase in size with the number of devices tested in parallel. Interface Products are included in our recurring revenues.
Spares and Kits. We provide consumable, non-consumable and spare items that are used to maintain, sustain or otherwise enable customers’ equipment to meet its performance, availability and production requirements. We also design and manufacture a wide range of device dedication kits that enable handlers to process different semiconductor packages. Spares and Kits are included in our recurring revenues.
Services. Our worldwide service organization performs installations and necessary maintenance of systems sold. We provide various parts and labor warranties on test and handling systems and instruments designed and manufactured by us and warranties on certain components that have been purchased from other manufacturers and incorporated into our test and handling systems. We also provide training on the maintenance and operation of our systems as well as application, data management software and consulting services on our products. Our InSight test cell enterprise software platform provides our customers with a centralized data management system to monitor equipment performance. Services are included in our recurring revenues.
Bare Board PCB Test Systems. Bare board PCB test systems are used to test pre-assembly printed circuit boards. Our PCB test systems include flying probe testers, which are used to test low-volume, highly complex circuit boards and do not require the use of a separate test fixture, as well as universal grid testers, which require the use of a custom test fixture and are well-suited for circuit boards in high volume manufacturing.

Sales by Product Line 
 
During the last three years, our consolidated net sales were distributed as follows:
 

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------+-----+------+-----+-----
Semiconductor test & inspection systems (including kits) | | 50% | | 51% | | 55%
Interface products, spares, kits (not as part of systems sales) and services | | 45% | | 44% | | 43%
PCB test systems | | 5% | | 5% | | 2% 

Customers
 
Our customers include semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, fabless design houses, PCB manufacturers, and test subcontractors throughout the world. Repeat sales to existing customers represent a significant portion of our sales. During the last three years, customers of our Semiconductor Test & Inspection segment that comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated net sales were as follows:

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
------+------+---+------+------+-----
Intel | | * | | 11.1 | % | *


*No single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 26, 2020 and December 29, 2018.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
No customer of our PCB Test segment exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 or December 29, 2018.
 
The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers, including reductions due to market, economic or competitive conditions or the outsourcing of final integrated circuit test to subcontractors that are not our customers would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Additional financial information on revenues from external customers by geographic area for each of the last three years is included in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information” in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our products worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. In geographic areas where we believe there is sufficient sales potential, we generally employ our own personnel. Our United States, (U.S.) sales offices are located in Poway and Milpitas, California, Lincoln, Rhode Island and Norwood, Massachusetts. Our European sales offices are located in Wertheim and Kolbermoor, Germany; Grenoble, France; Agrate, Italy and La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. We operate in Asia with sales and service offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.
Competition
 
The semiconductor equipment and PCB test industries are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change and demanding worldwide service requirements. Significant competitive factors include product performance, price, reliability, lead-time, customer support and installed base of products. While we believe that we are the leading worldwide supplier of semiconductor test handling equipment, we face substantial competition in Japan and Taiwan which represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market. Test subcontractors in Asia also purchase mostly from local Asian competitors. In the semiconductor test market, we face competition from two dominant suppliers headquartered in the U.S. and Japan, both of which are substantially larger than Cohu’s test business. While we are among the leading worldwide suppliers of test contactors, this market is fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. Further, the PCB test industry is characterized by significant Asia-based competition and intense price competition. To remain competitive within the industries we serve, we believe we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, maintain localized customer support and service centers worldwide and to invest in research and development of new products. Failure to introduce new products in a timely manner or the introduction by competitors of products with actual or perceived advantages could result in a loss of competitive position and reduced sales of existing products. No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully throughout the world.

Backlog
 
Our backlog of unfilled orders for products, by segment at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was as follows:
 

(in millions) | 2020 | | 2019 | 
--------------------------------+------+-------+------+--
Semiconductor Test & Inspection | $ | 237.1 | | $ | 149.9
PCB Test | | 22.4 | | | 10.5 
Total consolidated backlog | $ | 259.5 | | $ | 160.4

 
Backlog is generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of actual sales in any future period due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules, cancellation of orders, potential delays in product shipments, and difficulties in obtaining parts from suppliers or failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements resulting in the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements. Furthermore, many orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. A reduction in backlog during any period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
Our principal manufacturing operations are currently located in Malacca, Malaysia (handler operations and kits); Laguna, Philippines (kits and test contactors); Lincoln, Rhode Island (connectors); Osaka, Japan (probe pins); and Wertheim, Germany (bare board PCB test systems).
 
We outsource the manufacturing of many of our semiconductor automated test equipment products to Jabil Circuit, Inc’s facility in Penang, Malaysia. Our contract manufacturing partner is responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our contract manufacturer is responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products, except with regard to end-of-line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or sub-components which are financed and owned by Cohu. Contracting with a global provider such as Jabil, gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products closer to target markets in Asia, potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times.
 
Many of the components and subassemblies we utilize are standard products, although some items are made to our specifications. Certain components are obtained or are available from a limited number of suppliers. We seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, however in some cases the complete or partial loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our operations while we attempt to locate and qualify replacement suppliers.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
Our technology is protected by various intellectual property laws including patent, license, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. In addition, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological change in the semiconductor and electronic equipment industries, the successful manufacture and sale of our products also depends upon our experience, technological know-how, manufacturing and marketing skills and speed of response to sales opportunities. In the absence of patent protection, we would be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy or imitate our products or processes. We believe our intellectual property has value and we have in the past and will in the future take actions we deem appropriate to protect such property from misappropriation. However, there can be no assurance such actions will provide meaningful protection from competition. Protecting our intellectual property rights or defending against claims brought by other holders of such rights, either directly against us or against customers we have agreed to indemnify, would likely be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Research and Development
 
Research and development activities are carried on in our various subsidiaries and are directed toward development of new products and equipment, as well as enhancements to existing products and equipment. Our total research and development expense was $86.2 million in 2020, $86.1 million in 2019 and $56.4 million in 2018. The increase in research and development expense in 2019 was primarily associated with the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1, 2018. Incremental research and development expense directly attributed to Xcerra in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $44.2 million, $45.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively.
 
    4 

  

We work closely with our customers to make improvements to our existing products and in the development of new products. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully as introductions of new products could adversely impact sales.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. See the risk factor entitled “The semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable.”
