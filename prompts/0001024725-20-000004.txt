ITEM 1.BUSINESS.
TENNECO INC.
General
Our company, Tenneco Inc., designs, manufactures, markets, and sells products and services for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, and aftermarket customers. We are one of the world's leading manufacturers of innovative clean air, powertrain and ride performance products and systems, and serve both original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and replacement markets worldwide. As used herein, the term “Tenneco,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refers to Tenneco Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1996. In 2005, we changed our name from Tenneco Automotive Inc. to Tenneco Inc. The name Tenneco better represents the expanding number of markets we serve. Our Class A Voting Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “TEN.”
On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Federal-Mogul LLC (“Federal-Mogul”, the “Federal-Mogul Acquisition”), a global supplier of technology and innovation in vehicle and industrial products for fuel economy, emissions reductions, and safety systems. Federal-Mogul serves the world’s foremost OEM and servicers (“OES”, and together with OEM, “OE”) of automotive, light, medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, off road, agricultural, marine, rail, aerospace, and power generation and industrial equipment, as well as the worldwide aftermarket. The purchase price was $3.7 billion.
Following the closing of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to pursue the separation of the combined company. As such, we previously announced our intention to separate our businesses through a spin-off transaction to form two new, independent, publicly traded companies, a new Powertrain Technology company (“New Tenneco”) and an Aftermarket and Ride Performance company (“DRiV”). Current end-market conditions are affecting our ability to complete a separation within our previously announced timeline and we expect these trends will continue throughout this year. During 2020, we will be focused on the execution of our accelerated performance improvement plan (“Accelerate”) to facilitate the expected separation of New Tenneco and DRiV. The Accelerate program is focused on achieving additional cost savings, improving capital efficiency, and reducing leverage. We have made significant progress to facilitate the planned separation of the DRiV business and have completed all necessary system and process components required for New Tenneco and DRiV to operate independently. In this respect, we are ready to separate the businesses as soon as favorable conditions are present. In order to facilitate the separation, we continue to evaluate multiple strategic alternatives, as well as options to deleverage and mitigate the ongoing effect of challenging market conditions.
The New Tenneco business consists of two existing operating segments, Clean Air and Powertrain:

• | The Clean Air segment designs, manufactures and distributes a variety of products and systems designed to reduce pollution and optimize engine performance, acoustic tuning and weight on a vehicle for OEMs; and


• | The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty, and industrial applications.

In preparation for the separation, in the first quarter of 2019, we began to manage and report our DRiV business through two new operating segments as compared to the three operating segments we had previously reported. The DRiV operating segments are Motorparts and Ride Performance. The new Motorparts operating segment consists of the previously reported Aftermarket operating segment as well as the aftermarket portion of the previously reported Motorparts operating segment. The Ride Performance operating segment consists of the previously reported Ride Performance operating segment as well as the OE Braking business that was included in the previously reported Motorparts operating segment:

• | The Motorparts segment designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a broad portfolio of brand-name products in the global vehicle aftermarket within seven product categories including shocks and struts, steering and suspension, braking, sealing, engine, emissions, and maintenance; and


• | The Ride Performance segment designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes a variety of ride performance solutions and systems to a global OE customer base, including noise, vibration, and harshness performance materials, advanced suspension technologies, ride control, and braking.

On January 10, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 90.5% ownership interest in Öhlins Intressenter AB (the “Öhlins Acquisition”), a Swedish technology company that develops premium suspension systems and components for the automotive and motorsport industries, which is part of our Ride Performance operating segment. The purchase price was $162 million.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We design, manufacture, market, and sell innovative products and services for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial and aftermarket customers. We serve both original equipment (OE) manufacturers and replacement markets worldwide. Our portfolio of the industry’s most well-respected, enduring brands includes Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, among others. We seek to leverage our OE product engineering and development capability, manufacturing know-how, and expertise in managing a broad and deep range of replacement parts to service the aftermarket. We effectively manage the life cycle of a broad range of products to a diverse customer base.
As a parts supplier, we produce individual component parts for vehicles as well as groups of components that are combined as modules or systems within vehicles. These parts, modules, and systems are sold globally to the world's leading light vehicle and commercial truck manufacturers as well as aftermarket customers, including independent warehouse distributors, distributors, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, mass merchants, and service chains.
Our Industry 
The parts industry for vehicles and engines is generally separated into two categories, both of which we operate within: (1) OE parts that are sold in large quantities directly for use by manufacturers of light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and other mobility markets, and (2) “aftermarket” or replacement parts that are sold in varying quantities to wholesalers, retailers, and installers. Light vehicles are comprised of passenger cars and light trucks, which include sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”), crossover vehicles (“CUVs”), pick-up trucks, vans, and multi-purpose passenger vehicles. Commercial vehicles include commercial trucks, off-highway and industrial equipment, and two-wheel and motorsports. 
Global OE Industry
Products for the global OE industry are sold directly to OE manufacturers that use these parts, which include components, systems, subsystems, and modules, in the manufacture of new light vehicles, commercial vehicles, rail, two-wheeler, and motorsports. Demand for component parts in the OE market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles/engines produced, which is driven by macroeconomic conditions and other factors such as fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment trends, regulatory requirements, and trade agreements. Although OE demand is tied to planned vehicle production, parts suppliers also have the opportunity to grow revenues by increasing their product content per vehicle. Companies, like us, with a global presence, leading technology and innovation, and advanced product, engineering, manufacturing, and customer support capabilities are best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
Key Industry Trends Affecting the Global OE Industry
Global Vehicle Sales and Production
Our business is directly affected by automotive sales and automotive vehicle production levels. Both of these depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions and policies. There have been periods of increased market volatility and uncertainty in the level of economic growth in China, which has resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates than previously experienced. Despite these declines, and the recent moderations in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China are expected to result in stronger growth rates over the long-term. 
We have a strong local presence in China, including a manufacturing base and well-established customer relationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. Our business in China remains sensitive to economic and market conditions, and may be affected if the pace of growth slows in China or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. However, we continue to believe there is long-term growth potential in this market based on increasing long-term automotive and vehicle content demand.
Advanced Suspension, Autonomous Driving, and Shared Mobility
There is a growing demand for autonomy and new mobility services. A number of trends are driving “Auto 2.0,” defined as the transformation of cars into hybrid systems, fully-electric and autonomous vehicles, the consumer shift from individual car ownership to ride-sharing, and multi-modal forms of mobility. 
We expect higher levels of autonomy will drive increased passenger expectations for a comfortable ride, which, in turn, will create additional content opportunities per vehicle and heighten demand for advanced suspension technology products, including full-corner/around-the-wheel intelligent suspension systems and broader motion management solutions. Advanced suspension technology is expected to grow with adoption led by existing and emerging global OE manufacturers. Increased connectivity also presents additional prospects for active suspension systems, predictive vehicle diagnostics, and system-based integration within the vehicle as well as broader vehicle to everything (“V2X”) communications. The addition of Öhlins to the portfolio is expected 
to accelerate the development of advanced suspension technology solutions, while also fast-tracking time to market. It will also enhance our portfolio in broader mobility markets through the addition of Öhlins’ range of premium OE and aftermarket automotive and motorsports performance products.
Shared mobility describes a range of transportation options that involve the shared use of a vehicle, motorcycle, scooter, bicycle or other means of travel; it provides users with short-term access to transportation on an as-needed basis. Shared mobility may reduce vehicle volumes in established markets, but it also provides an opportunity for us to develop higher-mileage, durable solutions to meet the needs of new mobility fleets, as well as aftermarket replacement solutions and services. Additionally, ride comfort and durability will become important differentiators as consumers increasingly take advantage of the sharing economy.
Increasing Technologically Sophisticated Content and Vehicle Complexity
As end users and consumers continue to demand vehicles with improved performance, safety and functionality at competitive prices, the components and systems in these vehicles are becoming technologically more advanced and sophisticated. Mechanical functions are being replaced with electronics and mechanical and electronic devices are being integrated into single systems.
Focus on Fuel Efficiency Improvements and Powertrain Evolution
Continued focus on environmental sustainability by consumers and governments worldwide is increasing the expectations for the auto industry to develop more fuel-efficient solutions. Evolution of alternative powertrain technology, including the increased adoption of hybrid and fully electric powertrains, will also create further opportunities for increased ride performance and noise, vibration, and harshness (“NVH”) capabilities, as consumers look for smoother, quieter, and more efficient rides. Engine downsizing and hybridization will lead to a proliferation of NVH requirements per platform as road noise and other NVH properties that were once masked by engine noise become more apparent to consumers. Furthermore, fully electric vehicles (“EVs”) will likely have a suite of fundamentally different NVH, braking, and ride performance requirements. Our capabilities in the suspension, braking, and NVH performance materials categories provide the opportunity to develop solutions that maximize driving comfort, ride performance, and motion management for consumers worldwide in the increasing hybridization and electrification of the global vehicle fleet.
The products our clean air segment provides reduce the tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. In addition, regulations have been adopted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide. Reducing carbon-dioxide (“CO2”) emissions requires improving fuel economy; as a result, improved combustion efficiency and reduction of vehicle mass have become priorities. As a leading supplier of clean air systems with strong technical capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the more rigorous environmental standards being adopted around the world. 
The demand for smaller but more powerful engines requires more technology per engine to withstand the higher output requirements and reduce friction, which we estimate will result in an increase in content per engine for our powertrain business. With a global manufacturing presence, we believe we are well-positioned to meet expectations of our global customers. For the foreseeable future, it is expected that gasoline and diesel engines will remain the dominant powertrain for cars (including hybrids), heavy-duty, and industrial applications. We are equally capable of providing components for both gasoline and diesel engines.
Enhanced Vehicle Safety and Handling
To serve the needs of their customers and meet government mandates, OE manufacturers are seeking parts suppliers that invest in new technologies, capabilities and products that advance vehicle safety and handling, such as roll-over protection systems, advanced suspension technologies, and safer, more durable materials. Suppliers, like us, that are able to offer such innovative products and technologies have a distinct competitive advantage. We offer adjustable and adaptive damping as well as semi-active suspension systems designed to improve vehicle stability, handling, and control. 
We also are a global leader in the development of leading friction formulas that improve vehicle stopping distances and performance. As the commercial truck customers migrate to air disc brake systems, we remain at the forefront of providing the brake friction necessary for these new systems.
Many of our aftermarket products directly affect vehicle performance. Product quality, reliability, and consistency are paramount to our end-customers, the majority of whom are professional service technicians. Our engineering expertise and product capabilities from chassis to braking allow us to provide around-the-wheel offering. Additionally, we have a number of braking products including disc pads for passenger cars, motorcycles and commercial vehicles; drum brake shoes and linings for commercial vehicles; and brake accessories including rotors, drums, hydraulics, hardware, and brake fluid. 
Sourcing by OE Manufacturers and Component Part Number Proliferation
As OE manufacturers expand their reach, many are looking for suppliers with a global footprint and the capability to supply them 
with full system integration and solutions, rather than individual standalone products.
Because of these trends, OE manufacturers are increasingly seeking suppliers capable of supporting vehicle platforms on a global basis. They want suppliers like us with design, production, engineering and logistics capabilities that can be accessed not just in North America and Europe but also in emerging markets such as India and China. OE manufacturers have standardized on global platforms, designing basic mechanical structures suitable for a number of similar vehicle models and are able to accommodate different features across regions. This standardization will drive growth in production of light vehicles designed on global platforms. Accordingly, global platforms, identified as platforms produced in more than one region, are expected to grow. While the overall number of vehicle platforms will consolidate and decrease, the component level complexity to meet the diversified consumer and regulatory requirements around the world is expected to cause component part number proliferation.
As new and existing OE manufacturers look to simplify and streamline design, they are also increasingly selecting suppliers like us that provide fully-engineered, integrated systems, and solutions. OE manufacturers have steadily outsourced more of the design and manufacturing of vehicle parts and systems to simplify the assembly process, lower costs, and reduce development times. Furthermore, they have demanded from their parts suppliers fully integrated, functional modules, and systems made possible with the development of advanced electronics in addition to innovative, individual vehicle components, and parts that may not readily interface together. 
Global Aftermarket Industry 
Products for the global aftermarket are sold directly to a wide range of distributors, retail parts stores, and mass merchants that distribute these products to professional service providers, “do-it-yourself” consumers, and, in some cases, directly to service chains. Demand for aftermarket products historically has been driven by four primary factors: 

i. | the number of vehicles in operation (“VIO”);


ii. | the average age of VIO;


iii. | vehicle usage trends; and


iv. | component failure and wear rates.

These factors, while applicable in all regions, vary depending on the composition of VIO and other factors.
Key trends affecting the Global Aftermarket Industry
Growth in the Number of VIO in both Mature and Emerging Markets 
The global number of VIO is expected to grow, with the number of VIO in emerging markets such as China expected to increase significantly. The number of VIO in mature markets, such as North America and Europe, is also expected to grow, though at a lesser pace than the emerging markets. We have strong aftermarket positions in North America, Europe, and South America and a growing aftermarket position in Asia. We expect there to be aftermarket growth opportunities in emerging markets such as China and India where the VIO are expected to increase and are investing to position ourselves as a leading aftermarket supplier in these regions. We are leveraging our market-leading capabilities from mature markets and investing to develop the right distributor base, drive brand recognition, increase product coverage, build the supply chain, and promote our experience as an OE-quality supplier.
Increase in the Average Age of Vehicles in Operation
The average age of VIO in North America and Europe has increased significantly this century and is expected to increase further. Increases in the average age of VIO will drive the need for maintenance and repair work, thereby increasing the overall demand for aftermarket replacement parts in North America and Europe. The average age of VIO in China is expected to increase, which we believe will lead to continuing significant growth in the China aftermarket.
Managing Product-line Complexity and Private Labels 
We operate in a highly fragmented and dynamic industry and are among the few large, aftermarket-focused suppliers globally. The increasing global vehicle population, brand and vehicle complexity, and need for rapid new part introduction, as well as new distribution channels (including online) continue to drive significant stock keeping unit (“SKU”) proliferation and business complexity. Our recent investments in our supply chain and information technology capabilities are designed to manage this complexity, which we believe will be an important competitive differentiator.
In many of our markets, there has been an increase in private label or store brands sold by retailers and distributors at a lower price point than premium brands of the same products. However, in many cases, retailers or wholesale distributors creating private label brands still rely on established suppliers to design and manufacture their private label products and, in some cases, utilize co-branding to support their private label offerings. We intend to selectively continue to co-brand with private label manufacturers where it can help to strategically grow our branded products portfolio.
We have some of the strongest and most recognized brands in the automotive aftermarket. We will continue to invest in product innovation, marketing, and brand support that differentiates our premium branded products for their quality while also supporting lower priced, mid-grade offerings. Additionally, we will continue to drive productivity and cost reduction efforts and enhance our already strong global sourcing capabilities to remain competitive in each product tier.
Channel Consolidation
In the more mature markets of North America and Europe, there has been increasing consolidation in the aftermarket distribution channel with larger aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. These distributors generally require larger, more capable suppliers that have the ability to provide world-class product expertise, category management capabilities, brand management, and supply chain support, as well as a competitive manufacturing and sourcing network. We have undertaken many initiatives to support the value of our branded products to end-market consumers and diversify our revenue base. 
Growth of Online Capabilities and Changing Consumer Decision Making 
Reaching end-customers, which include distributors and retailers, technicians, and consumers, directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is expected to have an increasing effect on the global aftermarket industry and how aftermarket products are marketed and sold. The establishment of a robust online presence will be critical for suppliers regardless of whether they intend to participate directly in e-commerce. We invested heavily in online initiatives to improve our capabilities and connectivity to our end-customers, including a new online order management system, customer relationship management tools, global brand websites, and data analytics capabilities. We will continue to invest in these competencies. 
Additionally, consumers increasingly are utilizing online research prior to making buying or repair decisions. We will continue to expand our online presence in order to connect with our customers and more effectively communicate the value of our premium aftermarket brands.
Importance of Distribution, Speed and Parts Availability 
Efficient distribution capabilities are essential as the aftermarket industry works to balance product availability with overall inventory in the ecosystem. Installers expect the right product to be available at the right time and the need for fast, predictable local parts delivery is growing as consumers’ expectations for quick, high quality service increase. In addition, we are seeing the developing aftermarket augment traditional distribution and service models with real-time scheduling through personalized internet applications. We are adjusting our fulfillment models to optimize this complexity and better align and synchronize with our customers and supply base to reduce non-value add steps, time, and distance in our value chain. We are also engaging with key customers to jointly optimize product availability and delivery.
Resilience during Economic Downturn
Aftermarket products are largely stable, non-discretionary, and less susceptible to cyclicality as customers often have no choice but to replace automotive parts that are worn. During the 2008 economic downturn, the number of consumers with the ability to purchase new vehicles declined and led to increased demand for aftermarket parts in order to keep older vehicles road-worthy. 
Customers
We strive to develop long-standing business relationships with our customers around the world. We work collaboratively with our OE customers in all stages of production, including design, development, component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing, and delivery. For both OE and aftermarket customers, we provide timely delivery of quality products at competitive prices and deliver customer service. With our diverse product mix and numerous facilities in major markets worldwide, we believe we are well positioned to meet customer needs. 
Our OE customers consist of automotive and commercial manufacturers as well as agricultural, off-highway, marine, railroad, aerospace, high performance, and power generation and industrial application manufacturers. We have well-established relationships with substantially all major American, European, and Asian automotive OE manufacturers.
The following customers accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three years.

Customer | 2019 | | 2018 | 2017
General Motors Company | | % | | % | 14 | %
Ford Motor Company | 10 | % | | % | | %

Our aftermarket customers include independent warehouse distributors that redistribute products to local parts suppliers, distributors, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, mass merchants, and service chains. The breadth of our product lines, the strength of our leading marketing expertise, a sizable sales force, and supply chain and logistics capabilities are central to our 
11

success in the aftermarket. We have a large and diverse aftermarket customer base. 
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets. Customer loyalty is a key element of competition in these markets and is developed through long-standing relationships, customer service, high quality value-added products, and timely delivery. Product pricing and services provided are other important competitive factors.
As a supplier of OE and aftermarket parts, we compete with the vehicle manufacturers, some of which are also customers of ours, and numerous independent suppliers. We believe we are meeting these competitive challenges by developing leading technologies, efficiently integrating and expanding our manufacturing and distribution operations, widening our product coverage within our core businesses, restructuring our operations and transferring production to best cost countries, and utilizing our worldwide technical centers to develop and provide value-added solutions to our customers.
Seasonality
Our businesses are somewhat seasonal. OE production is historically higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. It typically decreases in the third quarter due to OE plant shutdowns for model changeovers and European holidays, and softens further in the fourth quarter due to reduced production during the end-of-year holiday season in North America and Europe. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. Our aftermarket operations experience relatively higher demand during the spring as vehicle owners prepare for the summer driving season. While seasonality does affect our business, actual results may vary from the above trends due to global and local economic dynamics, as well as industry-specific platform launches and other production-related events. Aftermarket sales tend not to be as adversely affected during periods of economic downturn, as consumers forgo new vehicle purchases and keep their vehicles longer, thereby increasing demand for repair and maintenance services. 
The aftermarket is affected by changes in economic conditions, volatility in fuel prices, and expanding focus on environmental and energy conservation. 
Order Fulfillment
For OE customers, we generally receive long-term production contracts for specific products supplied for particular vehicles with target volumes. These supply relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle, subject to interim design and technical specification revisions. In addition to customary commercial terms and conditions, long-term production contracts generally provide for annual price adjustments based upon expected productivity improvements, material price variation, and other factors. OE customers typically retain the right to terminate agreements due to changing business conditions, but we generally cannot terminate agreements given development cycles and change costs. OE order fulfillment is typically manufactured in response to customer purchase order releases, as we ship directly from a manufacturing location to a customer for use in vehicle production and assembly. Accordingly, our manufacturing locations turn finished goods inventory relatively quickly, producing from on-hand raw materials and work-in-process inventory within relatively short manufacturing cycles. Risks to us include a change in vehicle production, lower than expected vehicle or engine production by one or more of our OE customers, or termination of the business based upon perceived or actual shortfalls in delivery, quality or value.
For our global aftermarket customers, we generally establish arrangements that encompass substantially all parts offered within a particular product line. In some cases, we will enter into agreements with terms ranging from one to three years that cover one or more product lines. Pricing is market responsive and subject to adjustment based upon competitive pressures, material costs, and other commercial factors. Typical price adjustments occur on an annual basis as part of the product line reviews. Global aftermarket order fulfillment is largely performed from finished goods inventory stocked in our regional distribution centers. Inventory stocking levels in our distribution centers are established based upon historical and anticipated future customer demand, adjusted for lead times, demand variability and target service levels.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation we will supply certain levels of OE production over such periods, we believe outstanding purchase orders and product line arrangements do not constitute firm orders. Firm orders are limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible after receipt from the conversion of available raw materials and work-in-process inventory for OE orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders.

Clean Air designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes a variety of clean air products and systems. Vehicle emission control products and systems play a critical role in safely conveying noxious exhaust gases away from the passenger compartment and reducing the level of pollutants and engine exhaust noise emitted to acceptable levels. Precise engineering of the exhaust system - which extends from the manifold that connects an engine’s exhaust ports to an exhaust pipe, to the catalytic converter that eliminates pollutants from the exhaust, and to the muffler that modulates noise emissions - leads to a pleasantly tuned engine sound, reduced pollutants, and optimized engine performance.
The following table sets forth a description of the product lines sold by our Clean Air segment:

Product | Description 
Catalytic converters and diesel oxidation catalysts | Devices consisting of a substrate coated with precious metals enclosed in a steel casing used to reduce harmful gaseous emissions such as carbon monoxide. 
Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) | Devices to capture and regenerate particulate matter emitted from diesel engines.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
We have separate and distinct sales and marketing efforts for our OE and aftermarket customers.
For OE sales, our sales and marketing team is an integrated group of sales professionals, including skilled engineers and program managers, who are organized globally by customer business unit and product type (e.g., Ride Performance, Clean Air, and Powertrain). Our sales and marketing teams are focused on meeting and exceeding our customer's needs by delivering engineered products and services on time; maximizing profit for our investors while financing continued growth and product development; and developing a common system approach to create a superior customer experience. Our teams provide the appropriate mix of operational and technical expertise needed to interface successfully with OE manufacturers. Our business capture process involves targeting select programs and working closely with the OE manufacturer platform engineering and purchasing teams. Bidding on OE automotive platforms typically encompasses many months of engineering and business development activity. Throughout the process, our sales team, program managers, and product engineers assist the OE customer in defining the project’s technical and business requirements. A normal part of the process includes our engineering and sales personnel working on customers’ integrated product teams, creating a statement of requirements, and assisting our customers with full system or component design and development concepts that deliver expectations and create value for OE manufacturer customers. Given the Clean Air, Ride Performance, and Powertrain operations typically involve long-term production contracts awarded on a 
platform-by-platform basis, our strategy is to leverage our engineering expertise and strong customer relationships to target and win new business and increase operating margins.
For aftermarket sales and marketing, our sales force is generally organized by region and customer and covers multiple product lines. We sell aftermarket products through five primary channels of distribution: (1) traditional three-step distribution system of full-line warehouse distributors, jobbers, and service providers; (2) two-step distribution system of warehouse distributors that distribute directly to the service providers; (3) direct sales to retailers; (4) direct sales to service provider chains; and (5) direct sales through online channels. Our aftermarket sales and marketing representatives cover all levels of the distribution channel, stimulating interest in our products and helping our products move through the distribution system. Also, to generate demand for our products, we run print, online, and outdoor advertisements as well as training conducted by our field sales force and e-training courses. In addition, we maintain detailed web sites for certain of our brands. 
Business Strategy
We are a leading diversified, global supplier of innovative products and services to light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, and aftermarket customers. Our strategy focuses on addressing the evolving needs of our OE and aftermarket customers around the world to drive growth. The key components of our business strategy are described below:
Continue to optimize operational performance by aggressively pursuing cost competitiveness in all business segments and continuing to drive cash flow generation and meet capital allocation objectives
As we continue to expand our distribution and service capabilities globally, we seek to continue optimizing our performance through enhanced efficiencies in order to meet the world-class delivery performance our customers increasingly require. We have made and will continue to make investments in our global distribution network to maximize our manufacturing footprint and manage complexities of our supply chain. By achieving efficiency gains and cost competitiveness, we strive to generate strong cash flow and meet our capital allocation objectives, including deleveraging our balance sheet.
From a design perspective, we will bring a lean mindset to our portfolio to ensure standardization, remove redundancies, reduce transit costs, leverage economies of scale, and optimize manufacturing productivity. We will also continually look for ways to innovate and leverage cross- and up-sell opportunities to the market through a customer-centric product development process. From a manufacturing perspective, we will maintain a continuous improvement philosophy by streamlining plant operations and our network, and executing projects to improve efficiency. 
Serving our customers also requires that we compete effectively at the unit cost level, in particular with OE customers. We are making concerted and systematic efforts to continuously improve our position on the cost curve for each of our component part categories. In doing so, we will continue to be a preferred supplier to our customers.
We will be mindful of the changing market conditions that might necessitate adjustments to our resources and manufacturing capacity around the world. We will also remain committed to protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our employees.
Pursue focused transactional opportunities, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, product line
enhancements, technological advancements, geographic positioning, penetration of emerging markets and
market share growth
Throughout our history, we have successfully identified and capitalized on acquisitions, alliances, and divestitures to achieve strategic growth and alignment. Through these transactions, we have (1) expanded our product portfolio with complementary technologies; (2) realized incremental business from existing customers; (3) gained access to new customers; (4) achieved leadership positions in geographic regions outside North America; and (5) re-focused on areas that will contribute to our profitable growth. 
We intend to continue to explore strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that complement, expand, enhance or realign our existing products, technology, systems development efforts, customer base and/or global presence. We are committed to developing a broader ecosystem-based approach that allows us to work with new and existing customers, suppliers, and entrants to provide timely and leading-edge solutions across the mobility market. We will align with companies that have proven products, proprietary technology, advanced research capabilities, broad geographic reach, and/or strong market positions to further strengthen our product leadership, technology position, global reach, and customer relationships. 
Adapt cost structure to economic realities
We aggressively respond to difficult economic environments, aligning our operations to any resulting reductions in production levels and replacement demand and executing comprehensive restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives. Suppliers must continually identify and implement product innovation and cost reduction activities to fund customer annual price concession expectations in order to retain current business as well as to be competitively positioned for future new business opportunities. 
Original Equipment Specific Strategies
The converging forces of connectivity, autonomy, electrification, and shared mobility are spawning a new age of automotive autonomy and a unique opportunity to position our business for significant growth and profitability. We strive to strengthen our global position by designing, manufacturing, delivering, and marketing technologically innovative products and solutions for OE manufacturers. The key components of our OE strategy are described below:
Capitalize on our breadth of technology, differentiated products, and global reach to support and strengthen relationships with existing and emerging OE customers across the world
We conduct business with nearly all of the major automotive OE customers around the world. Within the highly competitive automotive parts industry, we seek to extend the significant advantages that come from our world-class global manufacturing, engineering and distribution footprint and global sourcing capabilities. This footprint enables the design, production and delivery of premium parts emphasizing quality, safety and reliability virtually anywhere in the world and also supports the continual innovation of new products, technologies, and solutions for new and existing OE customers.
Maintain technological leadership to drive further growth from secular market trends
In order to maintain our strong market positions, we are focused on meeting changing performance requirements and keeping up with emerging OE trends such as connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility, and electrification. In pursuit of delivering the ideal ride characteristics for any application, our ride performance division will leverage its innovative technology, NVH performance materials, differentiated products, and advanced system capabilities to provide innovative solutions. Aligning product lines and technical capabilities creates an ideal foundation to meet changing performance requirements for comfort and safety and again ultimately reinventing the ride of the future. The addition of Öhlins to the portfolio will accelerate the development of advanced technology suspension solutions, while also fast-tracking time to market. That acquisition is yet another example of our strategy to leverage key technologies that will better position us to take advantage of secular trends. It also enhances our portfolio in broader mobility markets through the addition of Öhlins’ range of premium OE and aftermarket automotive and motorsports performance products. In addition, our suite of mobility solutions under development represents an opportunity to drive greater partnership with OE manufacturers and broader mobility ecosystem players, creating and capturing value, and growth with higher value content per vehicle.
OE manufacturers are responding to changing end customer trends and preferences alongside their own challenging cost structures by reducing design and production complexities and investing in advanced technologies that enable vehicle electrification and autonomy. We anticipate that OE suppliers with high technology capabilities in vehicle system integration will be able to enable a more seamless transition to next-generation electric vehicles and become preferred suppliers to OE manufacturers. Though many vehicle and customer requirements will evolve, we believe one of the remaining characteristics that will continue to provide differentiated experience and value in the future of mobility is the ride experience. By leveraging our deep component level expertise as well as working with partners across the broader mobility ecosystem, our intent is to lead in the next generation development of motion management products, systems and solutions to engineer the ideal ride for any customer. 
Penetrate adjacent market segments
We seek to penetrate a variety of adjacent sales opportunities and achieve growth in higher-margin businesses by applying our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities. For example, we aggressively leverage our technology and engineering leadership in powertrain, clean air, ride performance and aftermarket into adjacent sales opportunities for heavy-duty trucks, buses, agricultural equipment, construction machinery, and other vehicles in other regions around the world. 
We design and launch clean air products for commercial vehicle customers such as Caterpillar, for whom we are their global diesel clean air system integrator, John Deere, Navistar, Deutz, Daimler Trucks, Scania, Weichai Power, FAW Group, and Kubota. We also engineer and build modular NOx-reduction systems for large engines that meet standards of the International Maritime Organization, among others.
Aftermarket Specific Strategies
Our aftermarket business strategy incorporates a go-to-market model that we believe differentiates us from our competitors and creates structural support for sustained revenue growth. The model is designed to drive revenue growth by capitalizing on three of the company’s key competitive strengths: a leading portfolio of products and brands; extensive global manufacturing, distribution and service capabilities; and market intelligence gathered from the company’s distributors, installers and consumers. 
We expect this distinctive go-to-market model will result in a sustainable competitive advantage, particularly as the industry trends previously mentioned disrupt the traditional aftermarket landscape and business practices. We expect the demand for replacement parts to increase as a result of the increase in the average age of VIO and the increase in the average miles driven per year. The characteristics of aftermarket sales and distribution are defined regionally, which require regionally focused strategies to address the key success factors of our customers. The key components of our aftermarket strategy are described below:
Leverage the strength of our global aftermarket leading brands positions, product portfolio and range, marketing and selling expertise, and distribution and logistics capabilities
Our aftermarket business includes multiple leading brands with strong product offerings. Our portfolio includes the industry’s most well-respected and enduring brands. We will leverage our go-to-market model to build upon our brand strengths and grow our global aftermarket business by consistently delivering differentiated benefits, by growing our brand equity among our target end-customers, and by leveraging our broad product coverage and extensive distribution network. We are in an outstanding position to capitalize on aftermarket trends and expand in mature markets (e.g., North America, Europe, and Australia) as well as high-growth regions (i.e. China, South America, India, and Southeast and Northeast Asia). Important focus areas are enhancing our presence in high-growth markets; leveraging our portfolio and strong presence in suspension to expand our business globally; and diversifying outside of chassis with our sealing, engine and underhood products, as well as other components. 
Continue to strengthen our aftermarket capabilities and product offerings in mature markets, including North America and Europe
The scale of our aftermarket business allows for strong distribution channels that significantly enhance our go-to-market capabilities across mature markets in North America and Europe. We continually rationalize our already strong distribution networks with the goal of improved customer service at a lower cost. This is achieved by continually harnessing and leveraging market intelligence, and sharing information with our channel partners to drive best practices in go-to-market, manufacturing and distribution processes.
The North America and Europe go-to-market capabilities will be defined by positioning our distribution and installer partners for success. We believe this will require maintaining an extensive catalog of products to provide the ability to address customer requirements quickly and easily. Managing a large and complex catalog of products requires an understanding of the composition of the car parc within the regions including wear patterns, typical replacement rates based on weather, road quality, and average miles driven annually. These compositions differ significantly by region, which will affect the range and frequency of replacement part requirements. The understanding of these regional dynamics will help us provide the right parts when they are needed and achieve the industry’s best “Order to Delivery” times. We will continue to innovate product solutions that will be cost competitive and reliable, reduce install time, reduce the number of unique parts that installers need to inventory on-site, reduce the number of unique installer tools and equipment required, and improve installer safety. 
In addition to having a comprehensive product offering, we also strive to maintain very close relationships with our customers and help position them for success. We have launched a series of “Tech First” initiatives to provide online, on demand, and onsite technical training and support to vehicle repair technicians who use and install our products in North America, Europe, and China and plan to expand into South America. This initiative included Garage Gurus™, a network of technical support centers that provide some of the most comprehensive training programs in the industry to educate our partners and customers with emerging vehicle technologies and vehicle repair operational skills. We believe it is key to our strategy to provide aftermarket parts that are simple to install and to make sure our customers have the resources to know how to install these parts properly. In having the right products and resources for our customers, we believe we will continue to be a preferred aftermarket supplier and continue to drive growth in the Americas and emerging economic areas.

Increase aftermarket position in high-growth regions, notably in Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific region, particularly the high-growth markets of China and India, presents a significant opportunity for us to expand our business. We have made investments in distribution and in our sales force in both China and the rest of Asia to help drive growth in this increasingly important region. We must take into account the different operational requirements in Asia Pacific in order to drive aftermarket growth in this region. 
The Asia Pacific light vehicle and commercial vehicle aftermarket industry is fragmented with a large number of small 
distributors and installers that require different strategies and solutions than more mature consolidated markets. Distribution in smaller volumes will require us to have a hub and spoke warehousing approach to compete on the basis of optimal “Order to Delivery” timeliness while maintaining a broad range of products.
Additionally, buying online is the preferred purchase method for many smaller distribution and installer partners. The sophistication of the existing online marketplaces in Asia Pacific will require us to develop adaptive and flexible omnichannel tools in order to compete effectively. We believe that developing a competitive online platform for our Asia Pacific customers will be the foundation for us to build a digital platform that will improve our competitiveness globally.

Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 78,000 employees of whom approximately 50% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of two facilities in the U.S., most of our unionized manufacturing facilities have their own contracts with their own expiration dates and, as a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. 
Raw Materials
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in our manufacturing processes, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic raw materials, stampings, castings, and forgings. We also purchase parts manufactured by other manufacturers for sale in the aftermarket. The principal raw material that we use is steel. We obtain steel from a number of sources pursuant to various contractual and other arrangements. We believe that an adequate supply of steel can presently be obtained from a number of different domestic and foreign suppliers. We address price increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component sourcing and parts assembly in best cost countries, strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities, and aggressively negotiating with our customers to allow us to recover these higher costs from them.
Intellectual Property
We are the owner of a large number of United States and foreign country patents and trademarks relating to our products and businesses. We manufacture and distribute our aftermarket products and products sold directly to OE manufacturers under a number of trademarks that are well-recognized in the marketplace. The patents, trademarks and other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us are important in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of our products. The primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs, technologies, and products. However, we do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. While our current patents will expire in the normal course at various times between now and 2040, we continually develop new technologies and products and apply for and obtain new United States and foreign patents.
