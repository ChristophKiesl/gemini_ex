Item 1. Business.
Shake Shack Inc. was formed on September 23, 2014 as a Delaware corporation. Shake Shack Inc. Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SHAK." Unless the context otherwise requires, "we," "us," "our," "Shake Shack," the "Company" and other similar references refer to Shake Shack Inc. and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including SSE Holdings, LLC, which we refer to as "SSE Holdings." 
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSACTIONS
On February 4, 2015, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 5,750,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share, which includes 750,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. We received $112.3 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, which we used to purchase newly-issued membership interests from SSE Holdings at a price per interest equal to the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock of $21.00.
Shake Shack is a holding company with no direct operations and our principal asset is our equity interest in SSE Holdings. In connection with the IPO, we completed a series of organizational transactions including the following:

▪ | We amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of SSE Holdings (as amended, the "SSE Holdings LLC Agreement") to, among other things, (i) provide for a new single class of common membership interests in SSE Holdings ("LLC Interests"), (ii) exchange all of the membership interests of the then-existing holders of SSE Holdings for LLC Interests and (iii) appoint Shake Shack as the sole managing member of SSE Holdings; 


▪ | We amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to, among other things, (i) provide for Class B common stock with voting rights but no economic interests (where “economic interests” means the right to receive any distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, in connection with common stock) and (ii) issue shares of Class B common stock to the then-existing members of SSE Holdings on a one-to-one basis with the number of LLC Interests they own;


▪ | We acquired, by merger, two entities that were owned by former indirect members of SSE Holdings, for which we issued 5,968,841 shares of Class A common stock as merger consideration (the "Mergers").

See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about the above-mentioned transactions as well as the other transactions completed in connection with our IPO, which we refer to collectively as the "Organizational Transactions." As of December 28, 2016, we owned 69.1% of SSE Holdings and the non-controlling interest holders owned the remaining 30.9% of SSE Holdings. 
OVERVIEW
Shake Shack is a modern day "roadside" burger stand serving a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, crinkle cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group ("USHG"), which owns and operates some of New York City's most acclaimed and popular restaurants—Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Smoke, The Modern at the Museum of Modern Art, Maialino, North End Grill, Untitled, Marta and Daily Provisions—Shake Shack originated as a hot dog cart in 2001 to support the rejuvenation of New York City's Madison Square Park through its Conservancy's first art installation, "I Y Taxi." The hot dog cart was an instant success, with lines forming daily throughout the summer months for the next three years. In response, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation awarded Shake Shack a

contract to create a kiosk to help fund the park's future. In 2004, Shake Shack officially opened and immediately became a community gathering place for New Yorkers and visitors from all over the world and has since become a beloved New York City institution, garnering significant media attention, critical acclaim and a passionately-devoted following. Since its inception, Shake Shack has grown rapidly—with 114 Shacks, as of December 28, 2016, in 13 countries and 16 states, as well as the District of Columbia—and we continue to expand outside our home market bringing the Shake Shack experience to new customers around the world. 
Shake Shack's fine dining heritage and commitment to community building, hospitality and the sourcing of premium ingredients have helped us pioneer what we believe is a new "fine casual" restaurant category. Fine casual couples the ease, value and convenience of fast casual with the high standards of excellence grounded in our fine dining heritage: thoughtful ingredient sourcing and preparation, hospitality and quality. As a pioneer in this new category, we strive to maintain the culinary traditions of the classic American burger stand, while providing our guests with a menu of inspired food and drinks, made with carefully sourced and quality ingredients. 
THE SHACK PACT
Our commitment to the Shack Pact is stronger than ever. This is the agreement that every employee makes at Shake Shack to lead our company with integrity, with purpose and with intention. It’s our mission and vision. Quite simply: it’s What We Do and Who We Are and it’s the ethos of our work each and every day as we grow Shake Shack. The Shack Pact™ is prominently displayed in the team member areas of every Shack, on the inside cover of the Shackademics™ book (our training manual) and acts as the template for every pre-meal meeting agenda (daily Shack team meeting). 
WHAT WE DO:
We Stand For Something Good
WHO WE ARE:
We Are Boundless Hospitality
Hopsitality is in our DNA. We take great pride in our culture and believe that it is the single most important factor in our success. Our mission to Stand For Something Good® permeates throughout every Shack we build, every ingredient we source and every team member we hire. We take care of each other first and foremost so that we can take care of our guests, our community, our suppliers and our investors. We aim to recruit people who have integrity, who are warm, friendly, motivated, caring, self-aware and intellectually curious—what we call "51%'ers." We use the term "51%" to describe the inherent interpersonal and emotional skills needed to thrive on the job and "49%" to describe the technical skills needed for the job. Our 51%'ers are excited and committed to champion performance, remarkable and enriching hospitality, embodying our culture, and actively growing themselves and the brand. Danny Meyer's original vision of Enlightened Hospitality™ guided the creation of the unique Shake Shack culture that, we believe, creates a differentiated experience for our guests at each of our Shacks around the world. Our team is trained to understand and practice the values of Enlightened Hospitality: caring for each other, caring for our guests, caring for our community, caring for our suppliers and caring for our investors. These principles have been championed by Danny Meyer throughout his career and are detailed in his New York Times best-selling book Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business, and they are fundamental to the way we operate our business.
The Bigger We Get, the Smaller We Act
With every passing year, this mantra continues to drive and challenge our strategy. As we continue to grow, it's more important than ever that we cherish our roots, continue the ethos that led to the creation of Shake Shack and to never veer from our original vision. We make decisions that focus on the core of who we are, staying true to our mission to Stand For Something Good and the principles of Enlightened Hospitality. These principles drive us to seek out the finest team members, the tastiest ingredients, the best suppliers and the best community partners.

Hospitality in the Digital Age
In January 2017 we launched our first mobile ordering app for IOS nationwide. The launch of our Shack App is just another way we are trying to meet our guests where they are and provide a whole new way to experience Shake Shack. The Shack App was developed to elevate the in-Shack guest experience, resulting in shorter pick-up times and convenient mobile ordering. Guests can order Shake Shack when they want it and right from their phone. With the new Shack App, guests can pick their food, choose an available pick-up time and it will be cooked-to-order and timed to their arrival. The Shack App features the Shack classics—all-natural beef burgers, flat-top dogs, chicken, frozen custard, crinkle cut fries and more—and includes all of the mobile ordering essentials: guests can find Shacks via a location finder; pick from their favorite orders; keep track of food allergies; access nutritional information; see the latest events and promos; connect to all Shake Shack social media channels and share feedback.
We Are a Team: We Take Care of Each Other
Our people make all the difference. More than ever, it’s incredibly important to invest in our team. We believe the unity that we have built amongst our Shack teams and across the Company as a whole is a key driver of our ability to deliver a great guest experience and, therefore, continue to successfully grow our footprint. We seek to be the employer of choice by offering above industry average compensation in most markets, comprehensive benefits and a variety of incentive programs. As wages rise across all income levels, we continue to play offense to compensate our team at the right wage for their long term development. We believe that team members who are treated and trained well will deliver Enlightened Hospitality and a superior guest experience. Through our leadership development programs, we teach our team members the principles of Enlightened Hospitality and how to live and breathe our Shack Pact, the agreement that encompasses our value system and brand ethos. Ultimately, we know when we have the best team, we will reach our stated goals. 
Leaders Training Future Leaders
We invest in our team through extensive leadership development programs to ensure that Shake Shack remains a great place to work and a real career choice for team members at every level. We have built a culture of active learning and we foster an environment of leadership development throughout the entire life cycle of employment. We believe that our culture of Enlightened Hospitality enables us to develop future leaders from within and deliver a consistent Shack experience as our team continues to grow.
The Shacksperience and Steppin' Up Model
The goal of our training programs is to develop leaders and to cross-utilize team members throughout our operations. We call our team member life cycle and overall employment experience, The Shacksperience™. The Steppin' Up Model is the growth model for Shake Shack employees which defines the steps in the employment life cycle, beginning with the team member position and working up through the general manager position. It clarifies the eligibility requirements and training necessary for each position, outlines the growth opportunities at all levels of the organization and furthers our philosophy of "leaders training future leaders." By creating this visual model, employees have a clear view of the career progression for a Shack employee, which in turn helps foster communication in achieving these goals. We train our culture and guiding principles first, then move to menu knowledge, followed by a focus on operational training. We believe that everyone learns differently and our training programs use various formats: online interactive, video, hands-on and paper-based. Every team member has access to ShackSource™, our proprietary online training portal, which is used not only as a learning platform, but also as a communication tool for our team. ShackSource also allows team members to send recognition messages, comments, praise and thanks to their fellow team members across the Company. 
We care about our team and want to set them up for success in the future, both at Shake Shack and in their careers. We continue to invest in training materials that teach our team members how to reach the next step of the Steppin' Up Model. We've also developed training manuals on how to become a leader at Shake Shack. These training manuals lay out the specific certifications, procedures and modules each team member needs to complete in order to move up to the next level. In fiscal 2016 we created the shift manager position, a level between a team member and manager, which introduces the team member to certain managerial-level skills before making the full transition to manager. This is just one way we try to set our future leaders up for success and develop the leaders we need to meet our growth plans.

We Are Fine Casual: Inspired Food and Drink
We embrace our fine-dining heritage and are committed to sourcing premium, sustainable ingredients, such as all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef, chicken and bacon, while offering excellent value to our guests. Our core menu remains focused, and is supplemented with targeted innovation inspired by the best versions of the classic American roadside burger stand. Always focused on culinary creativity and excellence, we collaborate with award-winning chefs, talented bakers, farmers and artisanal purveyors who work with us in different and engaging ways. We never stop looking for the best ingredients and the best culinary partners in order to exceed our guests' expectations in every aspect of their experience. As we grow across the country, we are excited to collaborate even more with the talented chefs and suppliers who are leading our industry. 
Our signature items are our all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, crinkle cut fries, shakes and frozen custard. We cook our burgers and spin our shakes to order and strive to use the freshest premium ingredients available. 
Our Menu
Our menu focuses on premium food and beverages, carefully crafted from a range of classic American foods at more accessible price points than full-service restaurants. The Shake Shack concept and core menu items have not materially changed since 2004, which speaks to the timeless and universal appeal of our food offerings.

 | Burgers & Chicken
Our burgers are made with a proprietary whole-muscle blend of 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free Angus beef, ground fresh daily, cooked to order and served on a non-GMO potato bun. We take great care in the preparation of our burgers—from sourcing, to handling, to cooking—to ensure that the taste and quality of the burgers we serve is second to none. Our signature burger is the ShackBurger®, which is a four-ounce cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce™. Our burger offerings also include the SmokeShack®, 'Shroom Burger™ (our vegetarian burger), Shack Stack® and Hamburger. In fiscal 2016, we launched our newest menu item company-wide, the Chick’n Shack™, which is a 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free cage-free chicken breast, slow cooked in buttermilk herbs, hand-battered, hand-breaded and crisp-fried to order.
 | Crinkle Cut Fries
Our classic and passionately loved crinkle cut fries are made from premium Yukon potatoes and are prepared 100% free of artificial trans-fat. Guests can also enjoy our Cheese Fries, which are our crinkle cut fries topped with a proprietary blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. We believe the tactile pleasure and emotional attachment that our guests have to the crispiness and ridges of our crinkle cut fries is a nostalgic ode to the roadside burger stand of yesteryear. 
 | Hot Dogs 
Shake Shack was born from a hot dog cart in 2001 and we believe that our hot dog category gives our guests another premium category from which to choose. Both our beef hot dogs and our chicken dogs are made from 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef and chicken. Our signature Shack-cago Dog® is our nod to the classic Chicago-style hot dog, topped with Shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard. 
 | Frozen Custard 
Our premium, dense, rich and creamy ice cream, hand-spun daily on-site, is crafted from our proprietary vanilla and chocolate recipes using only real sugar (no corn syrup) and milk from dairy farmers who pledge not to use artificial growth hormones. Shakes remain our guests' favorite in this category and are scooped and spun to order. Our concretes are made by blending frozen custard at high speed with premium mix-ins. Since each Shake Shack intends to engage its community, each Shack has signature concretes, distinct to its location, that use locally-sourced mix-ins made by artisanal producers whenever possible. 

5 | Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K


 | Beer, Wine and Beverages
Our proprietary ShackMeister® Ale, brewed by Brooklyn Brewery, was specifically crafted to complement the flavor profile of a ShackBurger. At select locations, we also offer local craft beers tailored to each Shack's geography. When it comes to wine, our organic and biodynamic Shack Red® and Shack White®, grown and bottled exclusively by Frog's Leap Vineyards in Napa Valley, accentuate our fine dining ethos and provide our guests with premium beverage options not commonly found in our industry. In addition, we serve Abita Root Beer, Shack-made Lemonade, organic fresh brewed iced tea, Fifty/Fifty™ (half lemonade, half organic iced tea), Stumptown cold brew coffee, Honest Kids organic apple juice and Shack|20® bottled water, from which 1% of the sales supports the clean-up of water sources around the world.
 | Dogs Are Welcome Too 
We know that many dog owners treat their four-legged friends as family members. From our first Shack in Madison Square Park, we wanted to include dogs as part of the community gathering experience and developed the "Woof" section on our menu. ShackBurger dog biscuits, peanut butter sauce and vanilla custard make up our signature Pooch-ini®, which is available at Shacks with an outdoor space. We also serve dog biscuits to-go, handcrafted exclusively for us by a New York-based bakery. 

Culinary Innovation
We continuously innovate around our core menu and our team is constantly experimenting with seasonal and local products, to enhance our menu, drive revenue and give our guests more reasons to keep coming back to Shake Shack.
Shack-Wide Limited Time Offerings
We continued our LTO program through fiscal 2016 where we featured a new premium burger for approximately six months. We will continue to supplement our core menu with targeted innovation inspired by the best versions of the classic American roadside burger stands.

▪ | Chick'n Shack — In January 2016 we launched the Chick'n Shack nationwide at all of our domestic-company operated Shacks and certain international markets, and it has since become a permanent and top-selling menu item. The Chick'n Shack is crafted from a 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free cage-free chicken breast slow-cooked in creamy buttermilk marinade, hand-dipped into Shack-made batter, dredged through seasoned flour and crisp-fried. It's topped with pickles, crisp shredded lettuce and a tangy Shack-made butttermilk herb mayo made with chives, parsley and thyme. 


▪ | Bacon CheddarShack — In June 2016 we launched the limited edition Bacon CheddarShack nationwide. The Bacon CheddarShack is a 100% all-natural Angus beef hamburger topped with smoked Niman Ranch bacon and Wisconsin aged cheddar cheese sauce. To complement this burger LTO, we also offered Bacon Cheddar Fries, which are topped with smoked Niman Ranch bacon and Wisconsin aged cheddar cheese sauce.


▪ | Shake of the Week — We continued with our custard calendar through fiscal 2016 and promoted the Shake of the Week. Every single flavor of frozen custard could be hand-spun into rich, creamy and deliciously dense shakes. During the summer of 2016 we offered featured shakes, including the Blueberry Pie Oh My shake or concrete—a rich and creamy vanilla frozen custard blended with a slice of Four & Twenty Blackbirds blueberry pie and topped with whipped cream—and the Chocolate Cookies and Cream shake. Additionally, during the 2016 holiday season, we brought back the trio of holiday shakes at all Shacks—Pumpkin Pie, Chocolate Peppermint and Christmas Cookie—which were a huge hit. Moving forward into 2017, we will be replacing the Shake of the Week with a trio of seasonal shakes, offering our guests a new slate of premium shake offerings for extended periods of time.

Exclusive Offerings
In addition to supplementing our menu with LTOs, we also seek to create new and exciting offerings that are inspired by local favorites or special events. Some of our exclusive offerings from fiscal 2016 include:

▪ | Salt & Pepper Honey Chick'n — The Salt & Pepper Honey Chick’n is a crispy all natural cage-free chicken breast topped with a sprinkle of ground black pepper and a drizzle of salted honey and served on a pillowy potato non-GMO bun, offered at our Brooklyn Shacks in October 2016 for a limited time. The Salt & Pepper Honey Chick'n took home first prize at the Chicken Coupe during the 2016 New York City Wine and Food Festival. 


▪ | Shack Corn Dog — For a limited time at our Mall of America, Forest Hills and Upper East Side Shacks, we brought back the Shack Corn Dog, a Vienna all-beef hot dog dipped in Shack-made corn batter, cooked golden brown.


▪ | Lockhart Link Burger™ — This Texas exclusive cheeseburger is topped with a griddled Kreuz Market jalapeno cheese sausage link, ShackSauce and pickles.


▪ | Shack Apple Turnover — This sweet breakfast addition is a crispy Four & Twenty Blackbirds apple turnover dusted with cinnamon sugar, available at limited New York City Shacks serving breakfast.

Chef Collaborations
Our fine dining heritage has enabled Shake Shack to team up with some of the world's best chefs for short-term special menu items. We devote significant resources to menu innovation and are frequently invited to participate and compete in chef events such as the South Beach Wine and Food Festival's Burger Bash, which allows us to test out new creations that can often lead to the introduction of new items. Some of our more notable collaborations in fiscal 2016 include:

▪ | Crispy Peking Chicken — In April 2016, we collaborated with celebrated chef Erik Bruner-Yang to create the Crispy Peking Chicken, which consists of a crispy chicken breast with Maketto hoisin sauce, pickle, cucumber and scallion. This limited-edition menu item was only available at Shacks in the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area.


▪ | Coppa Burger — For the first chef collaboration in Massachusetts, we teamed up with Boston chefs Jamie Bissonnette and Ken Oringer to create the Coppa Burger, a limited edition burger named after and inspired by their award-winning Italian restaurant in Boston’s South End. The Coppa Burger is a 100% all-natural Angus beef hamburger topped with provolone cheese, griddled mortadella, cherry peppers, caramelized onions, mayo and shredded lettuce. The limited-edition burger was only available at our five Massachusetts Shacks.


▪ | Son of a Gun Chick'n Shack — At our very own Madison Square Park Shack on October 28th, 2016, we reunited with L.A. chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Animal and Son of a Gun to create the "Son of a Gun Chick’n Shack", a crispy chicken breast with spicy B&B pickle slaw and rooster aioli.


▪ | Harry's Shorty Burger — During the Miami Art Week, we offered the Harry's Shorty Burger at two of our Florida locations, which featured all the toppings of Harry’s signature Short Rib Pizza—juicy slow-roasted beef short rib, caramelized onions, arugula and gruyère cheese—all stacked on Shake Shack’s 100% all-natural, antibiotic-free Angus beef burger. In addition to this exclusive offering, Harry's Pizzeria featured the classic flavors of Shake Shack’s Shack-cago Dog with a fire-roasted Vienna beef hot dog, mustard-mornay cheese sauce, sport peppers, pickles, tomatoes and onions all tied together with fontina cheese and Harry’s tender, blistered pizza crust. 


▪ | Little Goat Burger — In celebration of the Chicago Cubs' World Series victory, we teamed up with Chef Stephanie Izard of Little Goat Diner, and created a special celebratory burger for parade day. The Little Goat Burger was a limited-edition cheeseburger topped with spiced goat chili from Little Goat Diner, pickled peppers and sour cream, on a toasted potato bun, available for one day at two of our Chicago Shacks. 


▪ | Den Shack — To mark the one-year anniversary of our first Shack in Tokyo, we worked with Zaiyu Hasegawa, the chef and owner of Tokyo’s two Michelin-starred Jimbocho Den, and created the Den Shack, an all-natural 100% Angus beef burger topped with applewood-smoked bacon, DEN miso ShackSauce, sansho pepper and house-pickled cucumbers, offered exclusively at the Meiji-Jingu Gaien Shack.

We Are A Warm Community Gathering Place 
Design Philosophy
The experience of being at Shake Shack continues to drive our strategy. Throughout fiscal 2016, and looking forward, we continued to enhance our design capability, simultaneously designing some of our most dynamic Shacks while gaining efficiency in the design process to prepare for the scalability of development ahead. The design of our Shacks is critical to the Shake Shack experience and we blend our core brand identifiers with features specifically designed for each Shack to be of its place and connect directly with its neighborhood. Whether domestic or international, we are passionate about securing vibrant sites and creating unique designs that give each Shack a hand-crafted look, are locally focused, and are appropriate for their respective communities. A typical domestic company-operated Shack is between 3,000 and 3,500 square feet with interior seating for between 75 and 100 guests. Additionally, whenever possible, our domestic company-operated Shacks feature either outdoor seating or easy access to a park or green space. We use high-quality tactile materials, warm lighting that focuses on every table and highlights the textured walls and seating layouts that encourage guests to relax and stay for a while. We take great care to build each Shack with thoughtful design, including distinctive architectural features, and compelling eco-friendly touches, such as a solar roof in a few of our free-standing Shacks—all while taking key inspiration from our first home in Madison Square Park. The original Shake Shack in Madison Square Park was designed by SITE Architecture and Design, led by James Wines and Denise Lee, in collaboration with Pentagram, led by Paula Scher. This design set the tone for a dynamic dialogue inside the park and our surrounding neighborhood that continues to drive our designs today. The overall atmosphere of our new Shacks evoke the very best from the original park kiosk, as well as the best of the fine dining experience in terms of the quality of design, materials used, lighting and music. We are mindful that each new Shack should embody the experience of the Madison Square Park Shake Shack—the line, the kiosk style, the experience of ordering food made just for you and the energetic open kitchen. 
Each Shack is specifically designed to be of its place and connect with its neighborhood, but we have developed a number of iconic brand identifiers common to every Shack, including wrap-around steel beams, open kitchens, large distinctive menu boards and tables made from reclaimed bowling lanes from New York. Although no two Shacks are alike, we believe that these brand identifiers are key components to the expression of the brand and the experience of Shake Shack.
Often during the construction of new Shacks, particularly those in new markets, we re-imagine the often uninspiring plywood barriers that surround a construction site and use this as a canvas to begin the process of introducing Shake Shack to the community prior to our opening. For instance, for our first Shack in California, we commissioned a public art piece, called the "Happy Wall," where passers-by could interact with the wall and create inspiring messages for the neighborhood. Additionally, during the construction of our Gangnam Avenue Shack in Seoul, South Korea, we had an engaging art installation where guests could meet up on the installation’s custom built-in seats, plug in and power up using complimentary smart phone charging stations; inspired by the charming New York City lights, the art installation illuminated at dusk alongside the lively Gangnam night lights.
Today, we continue to evolve our timeless designs through the engagement of different designers from around the country.  We continue to develop our prototypes, “classic” Shack designs, free-standing, in-line and unique, one-of-a-kind formats.  We are constantly pushing to be more creative and nimble, allowing us to ramp up our growth while making the Shack experience even more dynamic and accessible. In fiscal 2016, we introduced our second generation prototype model: a 3,200 square foot free-standing Shack that fits well in suburban locations, designed with more efficient use of materials while still offering the same full guest experience. Additionally, we have been adapting to smaller footprints, proving our versatility and the ability to enter and flourish in a variety of spaces. An example of this versatility is evident at our Shack at Penn Station where we have executed a great transit design for the commuter-on-the-go.
Beloved Lifestyle Brand
Since 2004, we have become a globally recognized brand with outsized consumer awareness relative to our current footprint of 114 Shacks, opening our first international Shack after only seven domestic Shacks. Shake Shack has become a New York City institution, a vibrant and authentic community gathering place that delivers an unparalleled experience to our loyal guests and a broad, global demographic. Shake Shack grew up alongside the emergence of social media and has benefited from an ongoing love affair with passionate fans who share their real-time experiences with friends. We aim to establish genuine connections with our guests and the communities in which they live. Shake Shack continues to be recognized in global media with impressions garnering attention well beyond our size.
Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K | 8

Shake Shack was born as the modern version of the old roadside burger stand during the birth of social media and the digital age. The premium positioning and brand voice, derived from the spirit, integrity and humor of Shake Shack, are reinforced by our contemporary, responsible designs and hospitable team members who Stand For Something Good; this identity anchors our marketing efforts. We believe that our guests appreciate the experience of coming to Shake Shack as a community gathering place and, thus, the heart of our marketing strategy is to communicate and connect with our guests both at our Shacks and through social media.
Digital and Social Media
Much like we design our Shacks to be community gathering places, we execute a social media strategy that creates an online, on-brand community gathering place. Our guests and fans easily connect with us through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and Snapchat. We recognize the impact of social media on today's consumers and we use these platforms to share information with our guests about new menu items, new Shack openings and other relevant Shake Shack information. As of December 28, 2016, we had approximately 219,000 Facebook fans, 329,000 Instagram followers and 68,000 Twitter followers. We communicate with our fans in creative and organic ways that both strengthen our connection with them and increase brand awareness. We use Facebook live-streaming to post videos including interviews with our culinary partners, Shack leaders and sneak peeks into our new Shacks. Snapchat is a new addition to the way we are able to connect with our guests by posting original video and photo content that tout our food, specials, events and community in clever ways. In June 2016, we ranked #4 on Restaurant Social Media Index's top 250 restaurant brands, which is measured on influence, sentiment and engagement.
The launch of our Shack App provides a new way to experience Shake Shack and promote our signature menu items as well as our creative promotions. In addition to our social media presence, the Shack App is another digital tool that allows us to further expand our brand awareness and increase connectivity with our guests. Guests will have the opportunity to take advantage of certain promotions and vouchers featured on the Shack App. After we launched the Shack App nationwide in January 2017, we ran a company-wide promotion offering a free single ShackBurger to each guest who downloads the new Shack App. In addition to the Shack App, we also made enhancements to our shakeshack.com website, which include a mobile-friendly interactive digital tool featuring allergen and nutritional data, dedicated Shack App page and a Shack city guide section with local geo-mapping. 
We are continually engaging our guests in line and sharing stories with them as they wait in the Shack. In the second quarter of 2016 we started implementing a new digital menu board in our Forest Hills and Upper West Side Shacks. The new digital menu board not only displays our featured items, but also messages about people and products we choose to partner with and shares our Stand For Something Good stories. We will continue to roll these digital menu boards out to our other Shacks throughout 2017 and 2018.
Community and Charitable Partners
Each Shack focuses on conveying a consistent national brand message while also tailoring marketing efforts to each Shack. We always have menu items that feature local ingredients and beers that are specific to each Shack's community. We also aim marketing efforts at local events which help position Shake Shack as a premium brand that is connected to its neighborhood through participating in local celebrations and developing relationships within the community. Outside of local events, each Shack has a local charity partner to which it donates 5% of the sales from one regionally-themed concrete. The Shack in Miami Beach, for instance, features the "Vice Crispy Treat," and donates 5% of this item's sales to the Nicklaus Children's Hospital. Our Mall of America Shack features the "Malt of America" concrete and donates 5% of the sales to Open Arms of Minnesota.
In addition to each Shack's local charity partner, Shacks will also participate or host other local charitable events. Some examples include:

▪ | Mayo's LineShacker — In January 2016, we teamed up with Jerod Mayo of the New England Patriots and a local Boston-area bakery to create "Mayo's LineShacker," a limited-edition shake available only at our Boston Shacks, with 100% of the proceeds benefiting the Boston Medical Center.


▪ | Super Fry Frickle Dog — In April 2016 we held a pop-up event at Garage in South Philly, where we served up the limited-edition Super Fry Frickle Dog—ShackMeister Ale-marinated shallots, cheddar and American cheese sauce, and crispy-fried Gordy’s Pickle Jar Thai Basil Jalapeño pickles—and Beer Nuts Concrete out of the rad food truck inside Garage’s

space. We donated all proceeds to Schuylkill Banks (which is our University City Shack’s charity partner), whose mission is to beautify and revitalize the tidal Schuylkill River.

▪ | Red-Zone Dragon Concrete — Our Upper West Side Shack partnered with a local school, offering the winner of a fundraising auction the chance to design their very own concrete. The winners teamed up with our culinary director and the Red-Zone Dragon concrete was born—vanilla custard with salted caramel sauce, fresh raspberries and coconut mango glazed donut from a local bakery.

Shack Track & Field™
With our commitment to community and balance, Shake Shack offers Shack Track & Field, a free community fitness club offered on a monthly basis, open to the public of all ages and abilities. Shack Track & Field partners with local running stores and offers a variety of activities, including group runs, bike rides and yoga classes. The program is entirely free and includes a complimentary drink at the Shack after each event. Shack Track & Field currently has eight chapters in cities across the country and continues to grow. 
Shack-wide Events
Shake Shack promotes annual events and limited-time offers to drive repeat visits and build intrigue among staff and guests. For example, Shacktoberfest™ is Shake Shack's ode to traditional Oktoberfest in which special sausages, beers and desserts are added to the menu for a 10-day period in the fall. 
Since 2012, Shake Shack has held The Great American Shake Sale™ during the month of May to raise money and awareness for childhood hunger. During The Great American Shake Sale, we encourage guests to donate $2 in exchange for a free shake (a $5 value) at their next visit. 100% of these donations go directly to Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. In May 2016, we raised $587,000 across our domestic company-operated Shacks for this initiative.
In August 2016, we partnered with Al Roker of the Today Show to create the Roker Burger, a 100% all-natural Angus burger topped with Niman Ranch BBQ pulled pork, double American cheese, red-eye mayo and pickles and offered it for a limited time during the month at all domestic company-operated Shacks. For each Roker Burger sold, $1 was donated to support Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. 
Pop-ups and Promotions
Throughout fiscal 2016 we continued to do innovative branding by collaborating with other chefs and creating various pop-up concepts as well as offering exciting promotions to drive brand awareness. These pop-ups are a key part of building the growing strength of the Shake Shack brand while capturing these unique moments that differentiate our brand. Some notable collaborative pop-ups and promotions include:

▪ | L.A. Sneak Peek Pop-Ups – To celebrate the opening of our first California Shack in West Hollywood, we held a sneak peek pop-up where we teamed up with our soon-to-be neighbors for a series of events, including: the Infatuation LA for Backlot Beats and EEEEEATS, hosted by Hedley and Bennett, where locals came out for ShackBurgers, cocktails and activities; hosted Movie Under the Stars in the parking lot of our Shack where we did a throw back in decoration to our Madison Square Park Shack; and collaborated with chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo and offered up Son of a Gun tuna melts, ShackBurgers and Shackwiches (chocolate whoopie pies stuffed with peanut butter frozen custard and toffee).


▪ | Kidrobot's Yummy World – For one day in October 2016, we teamed up with Kidrobot to transform our Madison Square Park Shack into "Yummy World," inspired by Kidrobot's Yummy World collection. We served our limited-edition Yummy World concrete—a blend of our vanilla frozen custard, Doughnut Plant doughnuts, rainbow sprinkles and strawberry jam—to Kidrobot and Comic Con fans who also received a complimentary Yummy World Blind Box Keychain while supplies lasted.


▪ | The Pass & Provisions – In anticipation of the opening of our Houston Shack, in October 2016, we teamed up with chefs Seth Siegel-Gardner and Terrence Gallivan for a one-day pop-up event in the back lot of Houston's The Pass & Provisions restaurant. We served ShackBurgers, crinkle cuts, P&P’s signature pizzas and locally-inspired booze and beers, giving Houston a first taste of Shake Shack.

Product Placement
Shake Shack has been fortunate to receive considerable product placement in movies, TV shows and other media without any cost to the Company. In fact, Shake Shack has been able to charge fees for these location shoots, which have included scenes from the motion pictures Something Borrowed and Tower Heist, as well as the acclaimed HBO series The Newsroom and Showtime's Billions and Shameless. We have also been featured in segments on The Daily Show, Saturday Night Live, CBS Sunday Morning and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
We Are Accountable For Results
Our brand power and thoughtful approach to growth have resulted in strong performance across a variety of geographic areas and formats. We grew from 21 Shacks in fiscal 2012 to 114 Shacks in fiscal 2016 spanning 16 states, the District of Columbia and 13 countries, representing a 53% compound annual growth rate ("CAGR"). As a result of our expansion and strong performance:

▪ | Our total revenue grew from $57.0 million in fiscal 2012 to $268.5 million in fiscal 2016, a 47% CAGR. Compared to fiscal 2015, total revenue increased 40.9% in fiscal 2016.


▪ | Net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. for fiscal 2016 was $12.4 million, compared to a net loss of $8.8 million for fiscal 2015.


▪ | Adjusted pro forma net income, a non-GAAP measure, increased 39% to $16.8 million, or $0.46 per fully exchanged and diluted share in fiscal 2016, compared to $12.0 million, or $0.32 per fully exchanged and diluted share in fiscal 2015. For a reconciliation of adjusted pro forma, a non-GAAP measure, to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share" in Part II, Item 7. 


• | Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 36% to $50.2 million for fiscal 2016 from $37.0 million for fiscal 2015. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures—EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" in Part II, Item 7.

(1) | System-wide sales consists of sales from our domestic company-operated Shacks, our domestic licensed Shacks and our international licensed Shacks. We do not recognize the sales from our licensed Shacks as revenue. Of these amounts, our revenue is limited to Shack sales from domestic company-operated Shacks and licensing revenue based on a percentage of sales from domestic and international licensed Shacks.

COMPETITION
The restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with restaurants competing on factors such as taste, price, food quality, service, location and the ambiance and condition of the restaurant. Our primary competitors include "better burger" concept restaurants, as well as other fast casual restaurants, and, to a lesser extent, quick service and casual dining restaurants. Our competition includes multi-unit national and regional chains, as well as a wide variety of locally-owned restaurants. Our competitors may operate company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants or some combination. Many of our competitors offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. We may also compete with companies outside of the traditional restaurant industry, such as grocery store chains, meal subscription services and delicatessens, especially those that target customers who seek high-quality food, as well as convenience food stores, cafeterias and other dining outlets. Our competition continues to intensify as new competitors enter both the burger and fast casual segments. We also face increasing competitive pressures from some of our competitors who have recently announced initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free meat. For more information regarding the risks we face from our competitors, who may have, among other things, a more diverse menu, greater financial resources, lower operating costs, a more well-established brand, better locations and more effective marketing than we do, see "Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry—We face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected" in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
We specifically target guests that seek an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes great food, unique and thoughtful integration with local communities and high standards of excellence and hospitality. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our market position, as we believe consumers will continue to trade up to higher quality offerings given the increasing consumer focus on responsible sourcing, ingredients and preparation. Additionally, we believe that consumers will continue to move away from the added time commitment and cost of traditional casual dining. We believe that many consumers want to associate with brands whose ethos matches their own, and that Shake Shack, with our mission to Stand For Something Good and our culture of Enlightened Hospitality, is a distinct and differentiated global lifestyle brand.

GROWTH STRATEGIES
We believe that we are well-positioned to achieve significant, sustainable financial growth. We plan to continue to expand our business, drive Shack sales and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies:
Opening New Domestic Company-Operated Shacks
This is where our greatest opportunity for growth lies. Shake Shack’s business model remains strong and we intend to open many more Shacks. We waited nearly five years to open our second Shack, and we are still in the very nascent stage of our story, with only 64 domestic company-operated and seven domestic licensed Shacks in 16 states and Washington, D.C. as of December 28, 2016. We believe there is tremendous whitespace opportunity to expand in both existing and new U.S. markets, and we have invested in the infrastructure that will enable us to continue to grow rapidly and with discipline. In fiscal 2016, we significantly expanded our domestic company-operated footprint by opening 20 new Shacks representing a 45.5% increase in our domestic company-operated Shack count. We plan to open at least 22 new domestic company-operated Shacks each year for the foreseeable future. We believe that over the long-term we have the potential to grow our current domestic company-operated Shack footprint to at least 450 Shacks by opening domestic company-operated Shacks in new and existing markets. The rate of future Shack growth in any particular period is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe for such expansion. We believe we have a versatile real estate model built for growth. We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and our significant brand awareness to successfully develop new Shacks in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new and existing, as well as small and large markets. We continue to be encouraged by the success of our multi-format strategy which includes Shacks in various formats including but not limited to urban centers, free-standing pads, mall locations, lifestyle centers, train stations, airports, outlets, airports and more. 
We will continue to expand in existing markets (Arizona, Boston, California, Chicago, Las Vegas, Minnesota, New York, Philadelphia, South Florida, Texas and Washington D.C.) in order to leverage operational effectiveness as we cluster in these high-density markets, but we will also enter new markets, such as Denver, Detroit, Lexington, San Antonio, San Diego and St. Louis. With only 114 Shacks around the world (as of December 28, 2016), we have identified many attractive and differentiated markets for the Shake Shack experience. In major metropolitan areas, we seek locations where communities gather, often with characteristics such as high foot traffic, substantial commercial density, reputable co-tenants and other traffic drivers such as proximity to parks, museums, schools, hospitals and tourist attractions. For every potential domestic company-operated Shack we consider, we apply rigorous financial metrics to ensure we maintain our targeted profitability. 
Capitalizing on Our Outsized Brand Awareness
One of the great advantages for Shake Shack has been our birthplace and headquarters in New York City. Rarely has a brand of our type been born in New York, and from a fine dining company. This gives us a tremendous media and brand power which often outweighs our relative size. We focus our efforts on building a genuine connection with our guests and integrating into their communities through investment in innovative marketing and programming. We utilize various social media outlets to actively engage with our growing online following. In June 2016, we ranked #4 on Restaurant Social Media Index's top 250 restaurant brands, which is measured on influence, sentiment and engagement. Furthermore, we believe that our press and media impressions and industry recognition are a testament to the strength of our brand. We were listed number one on the New York Post's list of "America's 20 Best Chain Restaurants" in 2016, named as one of the "Best Burgers in the U.S." and one of the "50 best Things to Eat in NYC before you Die" in 2016 by MSN Food & Drink, named one of "The 25 Most Innovative Consumer and Retail Brands" in 2014 by Entrepreneur.com, ranked #7 in The Daily Meal's "101 Best Restaurants in America" for 2015, winner of the 2013 "Most Loved Brand of the Year" from the RIZMY Awards, "Best Burger" at the 2014 South Beach Wine and Food Festival's Burger Bash and more. Additionally, we give back to the communities in which we operate, and strengthen awareness for philanthropic causes such as Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. Our marketing efforts focus on interacting with our guests in an authentic, innovative manner which creates memorable, meaningful experiences. The experience that we provide for our guests and local communities has generated a growing loyal following that promotes our brand through word-of-mouth. We believe that this outsized brand awareness will continue to fuel our growth in existing and new markets.

Growing Same-Shack Sales
Given the significant awareness of our brand and the excitement we have been able to generate for our market launches, our Shacks have generally opened with higher volumes and operating profits relative to their second year, following the strong initial honeymoon period. In year three, our Shacks generally mature and continue to grow from the second year base and then retain these higher volumes over time. We expect our Shacks to deliver low single digit same-Shack sales growth for the foreseeable future as the number of new Shack openings relative to our comparable Shack base remains our primary driver of growth. We do, however, continually focus on improving our same-Shack sales performance by providing an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes new seasonal and Shack-specific offerings, technological upgrades including the Shack App, unique and thoughtful integration with local communities and high standards of excellence and hospitality. We will continue to innovate around our core menu to keep our offerings fresh, while remaining focused on our signature items. 
Thoughtfully Increasing Our Licensed Shacks 
We will continue to grow our licensed portfolio by expanding further domestically, in the countries in which we currently have internationally licensed operations, as well as entering new international markets. This strategy historically has been a low-cost, high-return method of growing our brand awareness and providing an increasing source of cash flow. In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with a leading retail and food operator for the development of up to 10 new Shacks in Japan over the next five years. As of December 28, 2016 we have opened three Shacks in Tokyo—at the renowned Meiji-Jingu Park, Ebisu, and at the Tokyo International Forum. In December 2015, we announced plans to enter South Korea with a new licensed partner for the development of 25 Shacks over the next 10 years, and as of December 28, 2016 we have opened two Shacks in Seoul, South Korea, in the Gangnam district and the Cheongdam neighborhood. We believe there are additional international markets that will embrace the Shake Shack concept. Domestically, we are excited to work with HMS Host, as we continue to grow in airport locations around the country, including a planned Shack in LAX Terminal 3 in late fiscal 2017. We also intend to grow in more sports arenas, and will add Minute Maid Park in Houston to our baseball lineup in fiscal 2017. Given our position in New York and the success of our current licensed Shacks at home and abroad, we continue to attract substantial interest from potential international licensees around the world and we believe we have significant opportunities to expand our licensing footprint in existing and new international markets as our team, development opportunities and supply chain matures.
See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for financial information about geographic areas. 
OPERATIONS
Sourcing and Supply Chain
Shake Shack has always been committed to working with best-in-class suppliers, across our supply chain. Our Stand For Something Good vision guides us in how we source and develop our ingredients, always looking for the best ways to provide top quality food at an excellent value and accessible to all. We pride ourselves on sourcing premium ingredients from like-minded producers—all-natural proteins, vegetarian fed, humanely raised and source verified, with no hormones or antibiotics. We're also proud to share our animal welfare policy which can be found on our Shake Shack website. 
We have a regional strategy for ground beef production to ensure that we are always serving freshly ground and never frozen beef at our domestic Shacks. Initially, and around the time or our IPO, our beef production was focused in New York City. However, as we've grown around the country, we now have 10 butchers spread throughout the country who produce our burgers on a daily basis, and we will continue to partner with regional suppliers in new markets as we grow.
We have a limited number of suppliers for our major ingredients, including beef patties, potato buns, custard, Portobello mushrooms and cheese sauce. In fiscal 2016, we purchased all of our (i) ground beef patties from seven suppliers, with approximately 70% of our ground beef patties supplied by one supplier, (ii) chicken breast from one supplier, (iii) potato buns directly from one supplier, (iv) custard base from two suppliers, (v) 'Shroom Burgers from two suppliers, with approximately 75% of our 'Shroom Burgers supplied by one supplier and (vi) ShackSauce from one supplier. We have developed a reliable supply chain and continue to focus on identifying alternative sources to avoid any possible interruptions of service and product.

Distribution
We contract with one distributor, which we refer to as our "broadline" distributor, to provide virtually all of our food distribution services in the United States. As of December 28, 2016, approximately 84% of our core food and beverage ingredients and 100% of our paper goods and chemicals, collectively representing approximately 48% of our purchases, were processed through our broadline distributor for distribution and delivery to each Shack. As of December 28, 2016, we were utilizing 12 affiliated distribution centers to supply our domestic company-operated Shacks. We recognize that the safety and consistency of our products begins with our suppliers. Suppliers must meet certain criteria and strict quality control standards in the production and delivery of our food and other products. We regularly evaluate our broadline distributor to ensure that the products we purchase conform to our standards and that the prices they offer are competitive.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
Food safety is a top priority and we are committed to serving safe, high quality food. We have rigorous quality assurance and food safety protocols in place throughout our supply chain. We have a comprehensive supplier and ingredient selection process and maintain a limited list of approved suppliers. We thoroughly review the results of suppliers' internal and external quality audits, insurance coverage and track record on an ongoing basis. We have a food safety site inspection process and periodically perform supplier site visits, as well as mock food recalls. We have developed and implemented training and operating standards related to the food preparation, cleanliness and safety in the Shacks. We also have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure food safety across all domestic company-operated Shacks. 
Site Selection
Shake Shack is ultimately about the guest experience and our site selection focuses on choosing great sites where people want to be together. Our site selection process is actively led by our Real Estate Committee, which meets regularly and follows a detailed approval process to ensure quality, fiduciary responsibility and overall adherence to our strategic growth goals. We invest in analytical tools for extensive demographic analysis and data collection for both existing and new potential sites. In addition to our in-house team of experienced real estate professionals, we use a national real estate broker to manage a network of regional brokers in order to leverage external resources in pursuit of pipeline development and consistent deal flow.
Construction
A typical Shack takes between 14 and 16 weeks to build. In fiscal 2016 the cost to build a new Shack ranged from approximately $1.2 million to $3.4 million, with an average near-term build cost of approximately $1.8 million, excluding pre-opening costs. We use a number of general contractors on a regional basis and employ a mixed approach of bidding and strategic negotiation in order to ensure the best value and highest quality construction. 
Management Information Systems
Our domestic company-operated Shacks use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems created by NCR Corporation, which we believe are scalable to support our growth plans. These point-of-sale systems are designed specifically for the restaurant industry and we use many customized features to increase operational effectiveness, internal communication and data analysis. This system provides a touch screen interface, graphical order confirmation display, touch screen kitchen display and integrated, high-speed credit card and gift card processing. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average transaction size. 
In fiscal 2016 we introduced our first-ever mobile ordering Shack App for iOS where guests are able to order Shack menu items directly from their phone. It was launched at select Shacks in October 2016 and rolled out nationwide in January 2017. The Shack App was created in collaboration with several key external partners, aiding in the mobile production, mobile ordering platform, guest engagement platform and digital experience testing services during its development. Information from the Shack App indirectly interfaces with our point-of-sale system. We will continue to invest in the future development of the Shack App, including a version for Android. 
15 | Shake Shack Inc.  Form 10-K

Our back-office computer systems are designed to assist in the management of our domestic company-operated Shacks and provide real-time labor and food cost management tools. These tools provide the home office and operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces the amount of time spent by our Shack-level managers on administrative needs. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Since our inception, we have undertaken to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by registering our trademarks and service marks worldwide. As of December 28, 2016, we had 19 registered marks domestically, including registrations in our core marks ("Shake Shack," "Shack Burger," "" and "") and certain other marks, such as Stand for Something Good. Internationally, we have registered our core marks in over 80 countries spanning six continents. These marks are registered in multiple international trademark classes, including for restaurant services, food services, non-alcoholic beverages and apparel. We also own the domain www.shakeshack.com as well as over 300 other domain names for use in other markets.
In addition, we have agreements with the suppliers of our proprietary products stating that the recipes and production processes associated with those products are our property, confidential to us, and may not be provided to any other customer. Our proprietary products include the burger recipe for our whole muscle blend and the patty grinding procedure and the product formulations for our ShackSauce, 'Shroom Burger, chicken breast, chicken breader and buttermilk herb mayo, cheese sauce, unflavored custard base, chocolate custard base, and certain toppings and custard mix-ins. We also have exclusive arrangements with our suppliers of ShackMeister Ale, Shack Red wine, Shack White wine, all-natural hot dog and all-natural chicken sausage, relish and cherry peppers.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to, among others, nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements, food safety regulations, local licensure, building and zoning regulations, employment regulations and laws and regulations related to our licensed operations. New laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. See "Regulatory and Legal Risks" in Item 1A, Risk Factors for more information.
We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our results of operations, competitive position, or capital expenditures.
SEASONALITY
Our business is subject to slight seasonal fluctuations in that our Shack sales are typically nominally higher during the summer months, affecting our second and third quarters in a fiscal year. Additionally, given our use of a fiscal calendar, there may be some fluctuations between quarters due to holiday shifts in the calendar year.
