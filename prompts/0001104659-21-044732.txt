Item 1. | Business
----------------------------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics utilizing our proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura™, for the treatment of select chronic diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug provides an efficacy and/or safety benefit. ProNeura consists of a small, solid implant made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate, or EVA, and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is administered subdermally, normally in the inner upper arm, in a brief, outpatient procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period of several months. These procedures may be performed by trained health care providers, or HCPs, including licensed and surgically qualified physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician’s assistants in a HCP’s office or other clinical setting.
 
Our first product based on our ProNeura technology was our Probuphine® (buprenorphine) implant, which was approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union, or EU, for the maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder in clinically stable patients taking 8 mg or less a day of oral buprenorphine. Following reacquisition of the rights to Probuphine from our former licensee in mid-2018, we endeavored to build our infrastructure and grow our commercial capabilities with the limited resources at our disposal. While we made important progress in laying the groundwork during 2019 to transition into a company with full commercial potential, and also among other things manage the challenges of the restrictive product label, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program and the complexity of the distribution channel, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the resultant restrictions and lockdown of facilities severely impacted our ability to continue to expand our commercial operations. With limited financial resources and insufficient sales revenue during the first three quarters of 2020, we made the decision to discontinue selling Probuphine in the U.S. and wind down our commercialization activities, and to pursue a plan that will enable us to focus on our current, early-stage ProNeura-based product development programs. Probuphine continues to be commercialized in Canada and the EU by other companies who have either licensed or acquired the rights from Titan.
 
ProNeura Continuous Drug Delivery Platform
 
Our ProNeura continuous drug delivery system consists of a small, solid rod-shaped implant made from a mixture of EVA and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subdermally, normally in the inside part of the upper arm in a short physician office-based procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period. The drug substance is released continuously through the process of diffusion-controlled dissolution. This results in a continuous, steady rate of release generally similar to intravenous administration. We believe that such long-term, almost linear release characteristics are desirable as they avoid the fluctuating peak and trough levels of oral dosing that often poses problems in a range of disease settings.
 
The ProNeura platform was developed to address the need for a simple, practical method to achieve continuous long-term drug delivery, and, depending on the characteristics of the compound to be delivered, can potentially provide treatment on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to 12 months. We believe that the benefits of this technology have been demonstrated by the clinical results seen to date with Probuphine, and, in addition, that the development and regulatory process have been affirmed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and Health Canada approvals of this product. We have further demonstrated the feasibility of the ProNeura platform with small molecules, hormones, and bio-active peptides. The delivery system works with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. We have also shown the flexibility of the platform by experimenting with the release characteristics of the EVA implants, layering the implants with varying concentrations of drug, and generating implants of different sizes and porosity to achieve a desired delivery profile and have intellectual property covering this technology. Formulation development is conducted at a dedicated pilot plant established by Titan at the South West Research Institute, or SWRI, in San Antonio, Texas that includes cGMP manufacturing and testing capabilities. We also receive support services from the vast array of SWRI groups with expertise in manufacturing and material sciences. The facilities are compliant with both FDA and Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, requirements enabling us to work with controlled substances, and the manufacturing scale is ideal for product development during non-clinical and clinical testing stages.
 
Development Programs
 
Kappa Opioid Agonist Peptide Program
 
On October 27, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with JT Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or JT Pharma, for the acquisition and development of JT Pharma’s kappa opioid agonist peptide, or TP-2021 (formerly JT-09), for use in combination with our ProNeura technology. James McNab, a member of our board of directors, is a principal of JT Pharma. Several years ago, we began limited laboratory experiments in collaboration with JT Pharma to assess the feasibility of delivering TP-2021 using TP-2021 peptide-infused ProNeura implants, or TP-2021 ProNeura implants, inserted subdermally in animal models. Our initial work focused on TP-2021’s ability to activate peripheral kappa opioid receptors, potentially providing a non-addictive treatment for certain types of pain. Recently, our experiments have pivoted to explore the feasibility of also using TP-2021 ProNeura implants in the treatment of chronic pruritus, a debilitating condition defined as itching of the skin lasting longer than six weeks. In February 2021, we announced that early non-clinical studies of TP-2021 subdermal injection demonstrated high potency and specificity for the human kappa opioid receptor and this enables us to move forward with proof -of- concept studies in appropriate animal models of pruritus to test the implant formulation.
 
In 2015, an estimated 23 – 44 million Americans suffered from chronic pruritus in the setting of both cutaneous and systemic conditions. Current treatments include anti-histamines, corticosteroids, and over-the-counter lotions, all of which are relatively ineffective and may have undesirable side-effect profiles. The antipruritic effect of kappa opioid agonists is thought to be related to their binding to kappa opioid receptors on keratinocytes, immune cells and peripheral itch neurons. We believe, based on our early non-clinical data, that subcutaneous implantation of the TP-2021 ProNeura implants could potentially deliver therapeutic concentrations of TP-2021 for up to six months or longer following a single in-office procedure. We are currently conducting the initial non-clinical studies designed to establish proof-of-concept, and if successful, we will need to conduct Investigational New Drug, or IND, enabling non-clinical safety and pharmacology studies prior to any clinical studies.

Nalmefene Development Program
 
In September 2019, the National Institute for Drug Addiction, or NIDA, awarded us an approximately $8.7 million grant over two years for our nalmefene implant development program for the prevention of opioid relapse following detoxification of patients suffering opioid use disorder, or OUD. An injectable formulation of nalmefene was approved by the FDA in 1995 for the management and reversal of opioid overdose, including respiratory depression. Oral nalmefene was approved by the EMA in 2013 for treating alcohol dependence. A nasal formulation of nalmefene is currently in clinical development by another company for the treatment of opioid overdose.
 
The NIDA grant provides funds for the completion of implant formulation development, cGMP manufacturing and non-clinical studies required for filing an IND. During the first quarter of 2020 we met with the FDA to review our non-clinical development plans and obtain guidance regarding filing an IND. Since other nalmefene formulations had already been approved by the FDA, we were pursuing a shorter, more streamlined 505(b)(ii) regulatory pathway in our development program. However, the FDA provided clear guidance on the type of development plan that we should follow, specifically that this product development should follow the more expansive 505(b)(i) regulatory pathway due to the lack of chronic safety data on nalmefene employing a long acting formulation, and the specific non-clinical studies that will be required to file an IND. Based on this input, collecting all the non-clinical chronic toxicology data will require an additional study as well as increasing the duration of an ongoing study that will delay filing of the IND to at least mid-2021. We have discussed the change in development plan with NIDA and they have accepted our plan to reallocate previously approved funds for conduct of the studies. Based on pursuing the 505(b)(i) pathway, the overall product development program cost is expected to increase considerably, and while we will discuss this further with NIDA, it is uncertain whether these additional funds will be available from NIDA or from any other sources. 
 
Other programs
 
We are collaborating with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, or WRAIR, and SWRI in the early non-clinical evaluation of the ProNeura platform in malaria prophylaxis. The early data from this collaboration are encouraging and have been presented by the WRAIR staff at several conferences, and WRAIR has now received additional funding from the Department of Defense to continue the program with additional non-clinical testing of the atovaquone and proguanil implant formulations in large animal studies. WRAIR is also pursuing additional grant funding for testing other compounds that have shown promise as a prophylactic treatment for malaria and we will collaborate with WRAIR and SWRI as needed for the preparation of these implant formulations that, if successful, could be available to us for potential development and commercialization.
 
We have also conducted feasibility assessments and implant formulation activities with drugs used in the areas of chronic pain, type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism, some of which was done in collaboration with third parties. Further research and development efforts on a product pipeline based on our ProNeura platform technology will depend on the availability of funding, either through corporate collaborations, grants or other sources.
 
Management Restructuring
 
Effective October 18, 2020, Kate Beebe DeVarney, Ph.D, our Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer and a member of the board of directors, assumed the roles of President and Chief Operating Officer. Effective October 31, 2020, Sunil Bhonsle retired from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer. Marc Rubin, M.D. our Executive Chairman, assumed the responsibilities associated with the Chief Executive role, and together with Dr. Beebe DeVarney, oversee our product development activities.
Agreements
 
Knight
 
Pursuant to an agreement (as amended, the Knight Agreement), we granted Knight Therapeutics Inc., or Knight, an exclusive license to commercialize Probuphine in Canada as well as a right of first negotiation in the event we intend to license commercialization rights to any other products in Canada. We are entitled to receive royalty payments from Knight on net sales of Probuphine in Canada ranging in percentage from the low-teens to the mid-thirties. In addition, we agreed to be the exclusive supplier of Probuphine to Knight subject to a supply agreement between us and Knight. During the term of the Knight Agreement, we may not commercialize any product in Canada containing buprenorphine that is intended for a treatment duration of six months or more.
 
5

 

Unless earlier terminated, the initial term of the Knight Agreement will expire on the 15th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of Probuphine for opioid addiction in Canada, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018. If Probuphine is approved for another indication in Canada after the fifth anniversary of the first commercial sale of Probuphine for opioid addiction in Canada, we must negotiate in good faith whether to extend the initial term. After the initial term, the Knight Agreement will automatically renew for two-year periods until either party provides the other party with written notice of its intent not to renew at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term or then-current term. We or Knight may terminate the Knight Agreement in the event that (i) either party determines in good faith that it is not advisable for Knight to continue to commercialize Probuphine in Canada as a result of a bona fide safety issue, (ii) the other party has filed for bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or (iii) the other party materially breached the agreement and has not cured such breach within a specified time period. In addition, subject to certain exceptions and requirements, we may terminate the Knight Agreement (i) if Knight discontinues the commercial sale of Probuphine for a period of at least three months and fails to resume sales within the specified cure period, or (ii) in the event that Knight commences any legal proceedings seeking to challenge the validity or ownership of any of our patents related to Probuphine.
 
In the event of termination, among other things, Knight shall (i) cease commercialization of Probuphine in Canada, (ii) transfer title to all current and pending regulatory submissions and regulatory approvals for Probuphine to us and (iii) pay any royalty payments generated by Knight’s sales of Probuphine in Canada due to us.
 
Molteni
 
In March 2018, we entered into and in August 2018 amended an Asset Purchase, Supply and Support Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with L. Molteni & C. Dei Frattelli Alitti Societa Di Esercizio S.P.A., or Molteni, pursuant to which Molteni acquired the European intellectual property related to Probuphine and the exclusive right to commercialize Probuphine (which it renamed Sixmo) in Europe, as well as certain countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East and North Africa, or the Molteni Territory. We received an initial payment of €2.0 million ($2,448,000) for the purchased assets and an additional payment of €950,000 ($1,107,000) upon execution of the amendment. Additionally, Titan was entitled to receive earn-out payments for up to 15 years on net sales of Probuphine in the Molteni Territory.
 
The Purchase Agreement also provided that Titan would supply Molteni with semi-finished product (i.e., the implant and the applicator) on an exclusive basis at a fixed price through December 31, 2019, with subsequent price increases not to exceed annual cost increases to Titan under its current manufacturing agreement and for the purchase of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
 
In March 2018, we entered into a loan agreement, or the Loan Agreement, which amended and restated our prior loan agreement with Horizon Technology Finance Corp., or Horizon. Under the Loan Agreement, Horizon assigned $2,400,000 of the $4,000,000 outstanding principal balance of the loan to Molteni and Molteni was appointed collateral agent and assumed majority and administrative control of the debt. Molteni was given the right to convert its portion of the debt into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $216.00 per share and was required to effect this conversion of debt to equity if we completed an equity financing resulting in gross proceeds of at least $10,000,000 at a price per share of common stock in excess of $216.00 and repaid the $1,600,000 principal balance of Horizon’s loan amount. In September 2019, we amended the Loan Agreement with the goal of reducing our cash burn rate to enable us to focus on commercialization activities by extending the interest-only payment and forbearance periods by one year to December 31, 2020 and the maturity date by one year to June 1, 2022. In connection with the amendment to the Loan Agreement, as clarified by a subsequent amendment dated March 12, 2020, the final payments to the lenders were increased by an aggregate of $312,500 (exclusive of a restructuring fee payable to Horizon) and the conversion provisions related to Molteni’s portion of the loan amount were revised to eliminate the mandatory conversion feature, to reduce the conversion price to $6.75 per share and to cap the number of shares issuable upon conversion to 114,093.

In September 2018, Molteni made a convertible loan to us of €550,000 (approximately $642,000) which was converted in full into 14,943 shares of our common stock at $45.00 per share upon the receipt of regulatory approval of Sixmo for the EU in June 2019.
 
In September 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the percentage earn-out payments on net sales were reduced from the original range of low-teens to mid-twenties to low-teens to mid-teens. We also agreed to delay payments of any earn-outs until the later of (i) January 1, 2021 or (ii) the one year anniversary of completion of compliance by our manufacturer with EU requirements.
 
In October 2020, in connection with our decision to wind down our commercial operations, we entered into a Debt Settlement and Release Agreement, or DSRA, Agreement with Molteni and Horizon, the holders of our approximately $5.2 million of outstanding secured debt ($4.0 million principal amount and approximately $1.2 million in payoff amounts) to settle such obligations for $1.6 million in cash, the transfer of certain Probuphine assets to Molteni, including all of our manufacturing equipment, and the termination of our rights to future payments under the Purchase Agreement with Molteni. The DSRA Agreement provided for the release to us of the remaining collateral to enable us to continue operating as a research and development company.
 
JT Pharmaceuticals
 
In October 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the JT Agreement, with JT Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or JT Pharma, to acquire JT Pharma’s kappa opioid agonist peptide, TP-2021, for use in combination with our ProNeura long-term, continuous drug delivery technology for the treatment of chronic pruritus and other potential medical applications. Under the terms of the JT Agreement, JT Pharma received a $15,000 closing payment and is entitled to receive future milestone payments, payable in cash or in stock, based on the achievement of regulatory milestones, and single-digit percentage earn-out payments on net sales of the product if successfully developed and approved for commercialization.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which may not be patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
In June 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a patent covering methods of using Probuphine for the treatment of opiate addiction. Titan is the owner of this patent which claims a method for treating opiate addiction with a subcutaneously implanted device comprising buprenorphine and EVA, a biocompatible copolymer that releases buprenorphine continuously for extended periods of time. This patent will expire in April 2024. A U.S. continuation application is currently pending which includes claims related to Probuphine for the treatment of pain.  Related patents covering use of Probuphine with the continuous delivery technology for the treatment of opiate addiction have also been issued in Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. On March 21, 2018, we executed the Purchase Agreement with Molteni whereby the European intellectual property covering Probuphine, including the European patent, was acquired by Molteni. In October 2020, as part of the DSRA Agreement, Molteni acquired the issued patents related to Probuphine in Australia, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. Patents covering certain dopamine agonist implants, including ropinirole implant, have already been issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Israel and Hong Kong.
 
In October 2020, we acquired patent applications to a sustained release composition comprising certain kappa-opioid receptor agonists in combination with a biocompatible polymer matrix from JT Pharmaceuticals.  Applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and Hong Kong.
 
7

 

We also have pending patent applications in the US, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan and Mexico for implants for release of lipophilic or amphiphilic pharmaceutical substances, and for loadable porous structures for use as implants.
 
We have filed additional patent applications for a heterogeneous implant designed with some unique properties that may provide benefits to the structural integrity of the implants and potentially enhance drug delivery. Corresponding patents have been granted in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, and South Africa.
 
Future court decisions or changes in patent law might materially affect the patents or patent applications, including, but not limited to, their expiration dates.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Many companies, including major pharmaceutical companies and smaller specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutic agents designed for the treatment of the same diseases and disorders that we target. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staff and more experience in the regulatory approval process. Moreover, potential competitors have or may have patents or other rights that conflict with patents covering our technologies. Our product development programs are currently in non-clinical stages of development and once these commence clinical development we can assess and provide details on specific competitive environment.
Manufacturing
 
The manufacturing of Probuphine is primarily conducted at DPT Laboratories, Inc., or DPT, pursuant to a commercial manufacturing agreement with DPT that governs the terms of the production and supply of Probuphine. During 2020, we modified and expanded the manufacturing facility at this contract manufacturer to establish commercial scale capability to support EU regulatory requirements for the manufacture of Probuphine. In October 2020, we entered into the DSRA Agreement which transferred our manufacturing facility at DPT to Molteni. Under the agreement, we will retain access to the facility for the manufacture and supply of Probuphine to Knight for Canada.
 
Ongoing formulation development is conducted at a dedicated facility established by Titan at SWRI in San Antonio, Texas that includes cGMP manufacturing and testing capabilities. We also receive support services from the vast array of SWRI groups with expertise in manufacturing and material sciences. The facilities are compliant with both FDA and Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, requirements enabling us to work with controlled substances, and the manufacturing scale is ideal for product development during non-clinical and clinical testing stages.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 
U.S. drug development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and devices under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, or FDCA. Drugs and devices are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Products composed of both a drug product and device product are deemed combination products. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of some of our product candidates, we expect the primary mode of action to be attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, a manufacturer may need to recall a product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 

¨ | Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


¨ | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. These nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary.
 
Clinical trials
 
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
 

¨ | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits and provide a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


¨ | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or comparator treatments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the conduct of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
10

 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, finding from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Additionally, a sponsor must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 calendar days. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 
Pursuant to the Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
NDA and FDA review process
 
The results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for drugs that do not contain a new chemical entity the FDA has 10 months from the receipt date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the receipt date for a priority NDA. For drugs containing a new chemical entity, these 10 and six month review timeframes are from the filing date of an NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.

After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug's safety and efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA also may place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. As a condition to the FDA's approval of Probuphine, Braeburn was required to put the Probuphine REMS in place.
 
505(b)(1) approval process
 
Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA provides what is considered traditional drug development pathway to FDA approval of a drug product. This pathway is typically used for novel drugs that have not been previously studied or approved. This development approach requires the sponsor to conduct all studies necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug product.
 
505(b)(2) approval process
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved product or on published scientific literature, in support of its application. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional trials to support the changes from the previously approved drug and to further demonstrate the new drug's safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Expedited development and review programs
 
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under the Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinical development. Fast Track designation, priority review, and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Pediatric trials
 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, that includes within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of any product candidates we may successfully develop will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products are covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any products will be made on a payor by payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require our licensees to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 
Affordable Care Act and other reform initiatives
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 
For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to the ACA, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted and there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.
 
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
