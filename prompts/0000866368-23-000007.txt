The Company
The Company is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex and low-rise suburban office space. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned 471 buildings and one land parcel in six states representing 20,656,858 of our gross leasable area (“GLA”). 
Recent Company Developments
Merger
On July 20, 2022 (the “Acquisition Date”), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 24, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), a merger (the “Merger”) was completed between PSB and a direct subsidiary of Sequoia Parent LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Parent”), with the Company surviving. As a result of the Merger, the Company became a subsidiary of Parent and certain of its affiliates, and PS Business Parks, L.P (the “Partnership”) remained a subsidiary of the Company. The Parent is an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX, L.P., which is an affiliate of Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”). The common stock of the Company is wholly owned by the Parent and certain of its affiliates 
and is not publicly traded. The Preferred Shares of the Company were publicly listed until January 13, 2023. Refer to Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on basis of presentation.
PSB and its subsidiaries, including the Partnership and its consolidated joint ventures, are collectively referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our.” 
Public Storage Operating Partnership Interests 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon the Closing each partnership unit of the Partnership (a “Partnership Unit”) that was issued and outstanding prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Partnership Merger Effective Time”) (other than units held by the Company, Parent, or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) was automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $182.25 (the “Per Company Share Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes, which represented $187.50 per share of Common Stock as reduced by a $5.25 per share cash dividend paid in connection with the Closing (the “Closing Cash Dividend”) in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each Partnership Unit owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time remained outstanding as a Partnership Unit of the Partnership held by the Company or the relevant subsidiary.
As a result of the completion of the Merger, an aggregate of approximately 21% of the Partnership’s issued and outstanding limited partnership interests were directly owned by Parent and certain of its affiliates (other than the Company) (the “Parent Partners”). Pursuant to a Distribution and Contribution Agreement, immediately following the completion of the Merger, the Partnership redeemed all of such limited partnership units in exchange for the distribution (the “Redemption and Distribution”) to the Parent Partners of certain subsidiaries of the Partnership which held assets comprised of 58 properties located in California, Washington and Virginia (the “Non-Core Portfolio”). As a result of the Redemption and Distribution, the Company (directly or indirectly) owns 100% of the Partnership. 
Dispositions
We continuously evaluate opportunities with respect to our portfolio and may from time to time sell individual real estate facilities and land parcels or groups of facilities and land parcels based on market conditions, fit with our existing portfolio, evaluation of long-term potential returns of markets or product types, or other reasons. The size of such sales may be significant to us.
The timing of any potential future dispositions or strategic venture transactions will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to our capital needs, the availability of financing for potential buyers and our ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales. We cannot assure that we will dispose of any additional properties, enter into any additional strategic ventures, or that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of a suitable replacement property to effect a Section 1031 Exchange or be able to use other tax deferred structures in connection with our strategy.
Developments 
We believe that a portion of our long-term future growth will continue to come from the completion of our in-process development and redevelopment projects and, subject to market conditions, executing on future potential development or redevelopment projects on existing sites. In addition to ground-up development, we expect to redevelop existing assets in our portfolio and target acquisitions where our development expertise can add value to the asset and Company cash flow growth with a focus on in-fill submarkets of key U.S. distribution markets. 
Tax and Corporate Structure
For all periods presented herein, we have elected REIT status under the Code. For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our “REIT taxable income” (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our stockholders. This, along with the nature of the operations of its operating properties, resulted in no provision for federal income taxes at the Company level. In addition, the Partnership generally is not liable for federal income taxes as the partners recognize their allocable share of income or loss in their tax returns; therefore, no provision 
for federal income taxes has been made at the Partnership level. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein. 
The Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries and, as a result, these entities will incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities after consideration of any net operating losses.

Competition
Our properties compete for tenants with comparable properties located in our markets primarily on the basis of location, rental rate, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. Competition in the market areas we operate in is significant 
and has from time to time negatively impacted occupancy levels and rental rates of, and increased the operating expenses of, certain of our properties. The demand for space in our markets is impacted by general economic conditions, which can affect the local competition for tenants. Sublease space and unleased developments have from time to time created competition among operators in certain markets in which the Company operates.
Objectives and Strategies
Our primary objective is to grow stockholder value in a risk appropriate and stable manner by maximizing net cash flow generated by our existing properties.
We seek to maximize net cash flow of our existing properties by optimizing occupancy levels and rental rates, while investing strategically in capital expenditures that generate appropriate risk adjusted returns. Below are the primary elements of our strategy:
Concentration in favorable markets: We believe that our properties generally are located in markets that have favorable characteristics such as above average population, job, and income growth, as well as high education levels. In addition, we believe our properties are generally in markets with higher than average barriers to entry that are close to critical infrastructure, middle to high income housing or universities and have easy access to major transportation arteries. We believe that these characteristics contribute to property operating cash flow stability and growth. 
Standard build outs and finishes: We generally seek to configure our leasable space with standard build outs and finishes that meet the needs of a wide variety of tenants, minimizing the need for specialized and costly tenant improvements and enabling space to be “move-in ready” quickly upon vacancy. We believe this makes our space more attractive to potential tenants, allows tenants to move in quickly and seamlessly, and reduces the cost of capital improvements, relative to real estate operators that offer specialized finishes or build outs. Also, such flexibility facilitates our ability to offer diverse sizes and configurations to meet potential customer’s needs, as well as to change space sizes for existing customers when their needs change. 
Large, Diverse Parks: Our properties are generally concentrated in large complexes of diverse buildings, with a variety of available space sizes and configurations that we can offer to tenants. We believe that this allows us to attract a greater number of potential tenants to our parks and minimizes the loss of existing customers when their space requirements change. 
Smaller tenants and diverse tenant base with shorter-term leases: By concentrating on smaller spaces, we seek to reach a large number of smaller tenants in the market. We believe this focus gives us a competitive edge as most institutional owners focus primarily on large users. Small users perceive more incremental value from the level of customer service that we offer. We also believe having smaller tenants improves our diversity of tenants across industries, which improves the stability of our cash flows. In addition, our lease term tends to be short, which we believe allows us to quickly capture increases in market rents in our high-growth markets.
Superior Service to Customers: We seek to provide a superior level of service to our customers in order to maintain occupancy and increase rental rates, as well as minimize customer turnover. We believe that Link’s property management teams are comprised of the most experienced and effective real estate professionals in our markets. The Company has extensive experience in acquiring properties managed by others and thereafter improving customer satisfaction, occupancy levels, retention rates and rental income by implementing established customer service programs. 
Redevelop existing real estate facilities: Certain of our existing properties were developed in or near areas that have been undergoing gentrification with an influx of residential development, and, as a result, certain buildings in our properties may have higher and better uses. We will seek to identify potential candidates for redevelopment within our portfolio, and where appropriate will leverage the expertise and scale of existing operators and developers should we pursue redevelopment of any of our properties.
Insurance
The Company believes that its properties are adequately insured. Facilities operated by the Company are covered by comprehensive insurance, including fire, earthquake, wind damage and liability coverage from carriers, subject to customary deductibles.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including various federal, state, and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of such properties. These include various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters, labor matters and employee safety and health matters. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of certain risks related to such government regulations, including risks related to compliance with (i) the Americans with Disabilities Act and with related regulations, (ii) laws and regulations adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and similar public health emergencies, government, (iii) federal or state privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), (iv) environmental remediation requirements, and (v) laws and regulations relating to real property ownership, including property taxes and zoning changes or violations. Except for regulations discussed therein, we are not aware of any government regulations that have resulted or that we expect will result in compliance costs that had or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Human Capital
We have no employees. We have entered into a Master Services Agreement with Link Logistics Real Estate Holdco LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Link”), a portfolio company owned by Blackstone-advised investment vehicles, to provide, as applicable, corporate support services (including, without limitation, accounting, legal, tax, treasury, valuation services, information technology and data management), loan management, management services, operational services, property management services, and transaction support services to the Company.
