ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Description of Business
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on December 11, 2007, under the name Fluid Solutions, Inc. On May 6, 2009, Fluid Solutions, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of GS Wyoming in exchange for 100,669,998 shares of its common stock pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated May 6, 2009, with that corporation and its shareholders. On May 18, 2009, Fluid Solutions, Inc. changed its name to “Gold Standard Mining Corp.” and effected a 3.3-to-1 forward stock split. On July 17, 2012, Gold Standard Mining Corp. changed its name to J.D. Hutt Corporation, as it sought to engage in opportunities outside of mining and natural resource exploration. From that time, and for a period of nearly two years, the Company’s operations consisted of seeking other opportunities. On April 26, 2014, and with the appointment of George J. Powell, III, as its CEO and then sole director, the Company officially changed its business model to offer eco-friendly corporate apparel primarily constructed from recycled textiles. To better reflect the Company’s change in business direction, the Company officially changed its name to Code Green Apparel Corp. on May 15, 2015.
 
The Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, marketing and outfitting companies of all sizes and industries with eco-friendly apparel made from recycled textiles. The corporate apparel market encompasses a wide variety of apparel products and accessories ranging from customized uniforms to caps, t-shirts and aprons. We believe that many of these companies are actively seeking ways to incorporate being more environmentally friendly into their company and would entertain mandating that all uniforms be manufactured from recycled fabrics. As all of our products are eco-friendly, our strategy is to emphasize the sustainability features while at the same time providing our products at market competitive rates.
 
Code Green reduces the environmental impact of the apparel industry by designing, manufacturing and distributing apparel products from eco-friendly and sustainable textiles. It supports both the uniform needs and sustainability initiatives of companies worldwide, by offering a complete line of recycled apparel in the form of T-shirts, hats, polo shirts, pants, shorts, aprons, jackets and accessories. In addition, the company fulfills recycled clothing needs for organizations of all sizes hosting promotional, fundraising and special events. Its apparel collection is also available to distributors and screen printers through its wholesale distribution channel.
 
Sourcing, Manufacturing and Distribution
 
The Company currently purchases from a select number of vendors for the sourcing and manufacturing of its products. Through key relationships established by management spanning over 30 years, the Company has been able to gain access to those mills located overseas in Asia that can implement the closed loop production process as illustrated above. These vendors provide various services throughout the manufacturing process that include, but are not limited to, cutting, sewing, spinning, dyeing, and weaving. The Company is not dependent one vendor or contract manufacturer and, further, believes that there are several sources for its needed raw materials and contract manufacturers of its products available to the Company at competitive prices.
 
As the majority of the Company’s manufacturing needs are based on custom orders and with specific instructions, such as apparel type, design, logos, or colors, the Company has purchased, and will continue to purchase popular and frequently used items like hats and shirts to hold in inventory and to have readily available in order to fulfill smaller orders. However, customers the Company is seeking to attract are those with very large annual programs and that are very specific and detailed to fit their needs.
 
Process and Workflow
 
Once the Company has been introduced to an opportunity to bid on a specific workwear program, the Company receives what is known as a “tech pack” that includes all of the information and requirements surrounding that workwear program. This includes, but is not limited to, the type of garment or apparel, the fabric construction, sizing requirements, color options, and desired quantities. With this information, the Company is now able to determine which manufacturer to use in order to create samples through its manufacturing partners. The sample creation process is an extremely important and technical process and is the key component in securing both the order with the customer and selecting which manufacturer to fulfill an impending order.

As every order is specific to that customer, delivery and distribution of the final products vary on a case-by-case basis. Some customers will require that all finished goods be either shipped directly to their internal facilities or delivered to a 3rd party fulfillment center as selected and identified by the customer. The Company does not currently operate its own warehouse or fulfillment center. The Company feels that at this stage in its development that the most efficient and economical strategy is to provide all required warehousing or distribution services through a Third Party Logistics provider. With numerous options for Third Party providers the Company can provide distribution services that are competitive in the market while allowing for control of overhead.
 
The Company began delivering its first shipments of eco-friendly products into the marketplace during 2016. These initial shipments were well received by its customers and the Company remains very optimistic about the reception of the market to its products. Some of these initial shipments have in fact resulted in new and additional programs that will ship in 2017. Additionally, the Company has been in receipt of a number of tech packs (as described above) for some potentially large custom apparel manufacturing programs. The Company has initiated designing and creating prototype and production samples in order to solidify these potential sales.
 
Target Market
 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics, there are over 130 million people in the workforce. The summary of the North American Workwear Market Forecasts, estimates that 35 to 40 percent of employees are given some form of uniforms, or “workwear.” Furthermore, the workwear market in North America is likely to reach annual revenues of $14.5 billion in 2015. The entire workwear market consists of three distinct market segments: general workwear, corporate workwear and uniforms. The chart below illustrates revenues across these three segments.

The Three Types of Workwear
 
First is “General Workwear,” which is further broken down into blue and white workwear. Blue workwear is made up of clothes worn by trades people and workers in heavy industry and manufacturing. Generally, these clothes include coveralls, shirts, jackets, boiler suits, aprons, warehouse coats or overalls. White workwear is made up of clothes worn by employees in the healthcare and hospitality industries. Medical uniforms and chef’s white uniforms are the examples for this type.
 
The second market segment is the “Corporate Workwear/Imagewear,” which includes career wear and casual workwear. Career wear is made up of workwear used for office-based jobs and customer-facing airline workers. It’s also known as business clothing / business wear / corporate clothing. For men, the business wear includes shirts, trousers, jackets and blazers. For women, it ranges from skirts, trousers, jackets and blouses. The other portion of this segment is casual workwear, most frequently used in logistics and tourism. This type of clothing is typified by the T-shirt or polo shirt.

The third and final market segment is “Uniform.” This is any workwear issued to personnel in the uniformed public services, such as armed forces, law enforcement personnel and postal services employees.
 
Sustainably Driven Companies
 
The U.S. Green Building Council states that of the Fortune 500 companies, more than half have embraced the logic of adding a sustainability program to their entity. They are keen to recognize the potential gains derived from public acceptance of their brand name because of sustainability efforts. Businesses are also finding that sustainability is increasingly important in compliance areas, especially in environmental health and safety. And businesses are finding that shareholders and upper level executives are interested and want sustainability programs.
 
Given the high demand for both workwear and the rising sustainability practices across companies worldwide, Code Green Apparel is strategically positioned to significantly capitalize on this target market with its offering of sustainable work apparel.
 
Competition
 
As previously referenced, the overall “Workwear Market” is a well-established segment of the overall global apparel market. As such, there are numerous suppliers and manufacturers that market both “branded” and “private label” apparel programs within the workwear markets.
 
This is understandable because the extensive breadths of products that are classified as “workwear” require most companies to specialize in one part of the business or another. For instance, a company that specializes in Flame Resistant apparel may not be the best source for embellished logo golf shirts. As a result, some estimates place the actual number of manufacturing servicing this market segment to be approaching 1,200 in number. Simple math will outline that the market itself is certainly sizable enough to support the numbers of competitors that participate in the overall “workwear” market.
 
The larger suppliers within the workwear market include:
 
● UniFirst
 
● Cintas
 
● Aramark
 
● G&K Services
 
These suppliers market a large volume of true “uniforms workwear” but they focus heavily on rental programs and offer an assortment of items that expend well beyond apparel. It is conceivable that Code Green Apparel could end up selling sustainable products to companies like these listed above for these rental programs.
 
More directly competitive to our business are suppliers that develop and market a sustainable alternative in apparel. Examples of market leaders in the sustainable market are:
 
● Loomstate
 
○ Primarily markets 100% Organic Apparel
 
● Omno
 
○ Focused on Hemp, Bamboo and Organic Apparel
 
● Enova
 
○ Develops apparel from Regenerated Textiles
 
5


We believe that Code Green is well positioned to compete against suppliers like those listed above because Code Green is leading the market in Recycled and Regenerated Fabrics.
 
The creation of Recycled and Regenerated textiles involves capturing waste material from the production process (pre-consumer waste product) and reprocessing this waste material into a reusable state that allows for up-cycling the waste into first quality textiles.
 
Regenerated fabrics offer near cost neutral alternatives to traditional fabrics. The Company feels that the marketing of Regenerated fabrics will create positive but disruptive market dynamics due to massive water conservation, dramatic reductions in chemicals used in the agricultural process and the potential to divert billions of pounds of waste fabric away from landfills and incinerators through the reclamation and up-cycling of the waste material. The Company acknowledges a competitive niche market segment for organic cotton and other alternative fabrics such as hemp, but believes the limited durability and significant cost increases associated with these fabrics will limit their market penetration.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that Code Green is positioned to compete on every level, as it is customer centric and committed to out-servicing its competition. The Company is committed to developing and marketing specific market apparel that is produced from sustainable textiles. This is a unique market position. Code Green is primed to compete in the overall market because of our premise of marketing sustainable textiles over traditional textiles. Sustainable, regenerated fabrics are significantly less damaging to the global environment than traditional fabrications. Over the past decade or so, more eco-sensitive alternatives have been introduced into the market but due to sizable surcharges these products have experienced limited success. Fortunately, we are now able to market regenerated textile alternatives to traditional fabrics at near cost neutral price points. We believe that this positions Code Green to be the supplier of choice for any organization that is committed to true sustainability.
 
Historically, the general “Corporate Workwear” market has followed the lead of the better-known retail market. As a result, the suppliers to this general market have been followers, not leaders when it comes to innovation. The Company intends to lead the market with our intent to market sustainable regenerated textiles and consider this to be one of our key competitive advantages.
 
Code Green is also proud to be a low overhead operation. Without the requirement to manage fleets of delivery trucks or to support massive support teams, we believe that Code Green can be responsive to customers’ needs on every level. Another way we plan to keep operating costs in check is by using competitively priced third party logistics (3PL) operations – allowing us to focus on building profitable programs. Again, we consider this a competitive advantage because of both the flexibility and cost controls that are inherent in this operating method.
 
Code Green has already established key relationships with dedicated support teams in Asia that are poised to support product development. Additionally, Code Green has the capability to produce product domestically if the customer demands or requires that to be an option.
 
The long history of low cost sourcing by our key executives combined with our vertical business model and extensive experience in the apparel market positions us to compete on a financial level as well. As evidence of our ability to compete for business, in the market, we have secured initial commitments from multiple targeted customers that will be recorded as shipments in the fiscal year 2017.
 
Sales & Marketing Strategy
 
The most significant element of our marketing strategy is our commitment to sustainable textiles. Our regeneration process delivers top quality apparel that is constructed from “up cycled” pre-consumer production textile waste. That means we can make claim to the conservation of tremendous amounts of precious water insecticides, fertilizers and pesticides. It also means that we will account for dramatic reductions in textile waste that historically was disposed of by burying in landfills or burning in incinerators.
 
We have chosen to focus on “Workwear” – defined as “Corporate Wear, General Workwear, and Uniforms”. Market research and personal experience indicate that this market can be less price sensitive that the traditional retail market and in spite of the breadth of the workwear market, the competition is not as severe.
 
“Sustainability” is being embraced by a growing number of major corporations that directly or indirectly provide for apparel and other textile products for their employees and customers. Many of these corporations have elevated their sustainability programs to a level of creating a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) for the corporation. We intend to target companies that have already publically announced sustainability programs and have assigned CSOs to their organizations. We plan to position ourselves to be a market leader and a market creator in sustainability.

Our sales strategy will follow the same direction. We intend to work with key accounts that already support a sustainable position. Our sales execution will rely upon top-to-top selling efforts performed by both senior executives as well as sales professionals within the organization.
 
We plan to drive customers to Code Green through direct contact and through the use of dynamic social media marketing campaigns. We plan to utilize aggressive Search Engine Optimization (SEO) programs to drive potential customers to our website (www.codegreenapparel.com). We will continually update our website and incorporate it into the confirmation aspects of the selling efforts. Our website includes information we do not desire to incorporate by reference into this filing.
 
The global “Workwear” market conducts a number of conventions, trade shows and other industry events. We plan to participate in these industry specific events when we feel it will enhance our ability to reach certain market segments.
 
Finally, we plan to launch a dynamic public relations campaign featuring our CEO on a variety of television networks and in numerous publications. Mr. Powell has deep media relationships and as previously appeared on television networks such as Fox News and Bloomberg TV.
 
Most importantly, as Code Green has progressed through the various registration and structural processes, we have also been targeting initial business partners. We are very happy to report that we have secured firm commitments from multiple accounts and are working diligently to expand our market reach. To assist in securing continued revenue growth, the Company has entered into a marketing agreement (described below) that it expects will result in numerous additional customer leads. In order to finance these production runs we will use a combination of customer financing (Letters of Credit and Advance Payments) as well as other traditional commercial debt financing (Purchase Order financing).
 
On February 9, 2017, the Company entered into an Advertising Services Agreement (the “Advertising Agreement”) with Cicero Consulting Group, LLC (“Cicero”), pursuant to which Cicero agreed to provide marketing and advertising services to the Company for a term of six months. In consideration for agreeing to provide those services we agreed to issue Cicero 32 million shares of common stock.
Employees
 
On April 26, 2014, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with our CEO, George J. Powell, III. The Employment Agreement has no term and provides the CEO with an annual base salary of $180,000. Outside of the CEO, the Company does not have any employment agreements with its other employees, provided that its only other employee is its Chief Operating Officer, Thomas H. Witthuhn. However, we have engaged approximately five individuals who are involved in marketing, business development, product design, bookkeeping, and other administrative functions.
Government Regulations
 
The Company is bound by all normal regulations that are associated with general apparel and textile marketing companies. These regulations include, but are not limited to, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules and regulations, local and state employment laws, product importation rules and regulations and common labeling requirements for finished products.
 
The Company is not subject to restrictive product regulation based specifically upon any Regenerating or Recycling processes for textiles. The Company believes its strategy to develop, produce and acquire all fabrications with third party suppliers will protect the Company from direct responsibility regarding local regulations in overseas markets. The Company will strive to assure its supplier base surpasses all social compliance thresholds.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 

● | Exemptions for “emerging growth companies” (such as the Company) from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an “emerging growth company” if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” after the earliest of
 

(i) | the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act further exempts an “emerging growth company” from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an “emerging growth company” regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the “emerging growth company’s” IPOs.
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” to submit registration statements under the Securities Act, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow “emerging growth companies” to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.

Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.
 
Asset Purchase Agreement
 
Effective on June 23, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with 10Star LLC (“10Star” and the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, on the same day, we purchased substantially all of the assets of 10Star (the “Assets” and the “Acquisition”). The Assets included all contracts relating to 10Star’s “On the Border” and “7-Eleven” accounts (the “Purchased Accounts”). The Assets specifically excluded, among other things described in the Purchase Agreement, all of the cash on hand, bank accounts and securities of 10Star, and all liabilities of 10Star, to the extent they do not arise after closing, under contracts that we assumed in connection with the Acquisition.
 
The purchase price paid for the Assets at closing on June 23, 2016, was (a) $50,000 in cash; (b) 5 million shares of our restricted common stock (the “Purchase Agreement Shares”); and (c) a promissory note in the amount of $200,000 (the “Promissory Note”), described in greater detail below.
 
During December 2016, the asset value of $280,000 was considered fully impaired. As such, the entire value of $280,000 less the accumulated amortization in the amount of $60,000, was written off.
 
As part of, and as a required term and condition of the closing, we entered into executive employment agreements with Aaron Luna and William Joseph (J.B.) Hill, to serve as Executive Vice Presidents of the Company (described in greater detail below) in May 2016, in anticipation of the Acquisition.
 
The parties agreed to certain post-closing requirements in connection with the Acquisition. We agreed that Chase Daniel, the Chief Executive Officer and majority owner of 10Star, would be invited to serve as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, subject to the Board of Directors confirming his qualifications, for a period of not less than one (1) year from the closing, which occurred in June 2016. We agreed to provide Mr. Daniel, upon payment in full of the Promissory Note, a commission equal to 3% of all net sales (gross sales generated by us, less (i) returns, (ii) discounts, (iii) adjustments, and (iv) allowances) shipped by us (and paid for by customers), relating to the Purchased Accounts, payable monthly in arrears. We agreed to keep complete and accurate books and records showing all net sales with respect to the Purchased Accounts and to allow Mr. Daniel audit and inspection rights in connection therewith. In the event any audit reveals a shortfall, we are required to immediately pay such shortfall, with any amount not immediately paid accruing interest at the rate of 15% per annum until paid, and we are required to reimburse Mr. Daniel for the cost of such audit in the event any shortfall is greater than 5% of the amount of commissions paid in the prior 12 months. Additionally, until June 23, 2019 (three years from closing), neither 10Star, Mr. Daniel, nor any of their affiliates, are allowed to, directly or indirectly, own any interest in, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, modifying, selling, and/or distributing of apparel (the “Business”), in the States of Texas or California, subject to certain exceptions described in the Purchase Agreement. Finally, within six months of the closing, 10Star is required to amend its formation documents to change its name to something other than ‘10Star’ or any similar name or derivatives thereof and to file any and all documents required to allow us to register the name ‘10Star’ as a trademark.
 
The Purchase Agreement also contained standard and customary representations and warranties and indemnification rights.

Promissory Note
 
Amounts due under the Promissory Note accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum (12% upon the occurrence of an event of default), with all interest payable on the maturity date of the Promissory Note, June 23, 2018, provided that the amounts owed under the Promissory Note can be pre-paid in whole or part at any time prior to maturity. Until the earlier of (a) the maturity date of the Promissory Note; and (b) the date the Promissory Note is paid in full, we are required to pay 10Star fifty percent (50%) of the Gross Profits generated by us in connection with the Purchased Accounts, no later than the end of the calendar month following the month during which we generate such Gross Profits and receive payment in connection therewith. “Gross Profit” means: (x) the total gross revenues derived from the Purchased Accounts, less (y) (i) cost of goods sold, (ii) returns, (iii) discounts, (iv) adjustments, and (v) allowances, and those other items that are customarily subtracted from total gross revenue to determine gross profit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Each payment is credited first to accrued interest and second to principal. The Promissory Note contains standard and customary events of default. The Promissory Note is unsecured and 10Star has no right to any collateral or security interests in connection therewith.
Recent Transactions:
 
Previously, in May 2015, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a consultant, pursuant to which the consultant agreed to provide business consulting services to the company for a term of three years (automatically extendable for one year periods thereafter unless terminated by either party), and the company agreed to pay the consultant $200,000 per year in consideration for such services.
 
On June 15, 2016, we sold Carebourn Capital, L.P. (“Carebourn”) a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $121,325, representing $105,500 borrowed from Carebourn and an original issue discount of $15,825 (the “June 2016 Carebourn Convertible Note”), pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 15, 2016. The Carebourn Convertible Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (22% upon an event of default) and is due and payable on June 15, 2017.
 
On May 1, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Anubis Capital Partners (“Anubis”), a business advisor. The agreement calls for monthly payments of $2,500 in service fees along with the issuance of a $500,000 fully earned convertible debt that accrues interest at 8% per annum. During December 2015, the Company issued 25,000,000 shares of common stock in payment of $212,500 of principal on this convertible debt. On July 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Compromise and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement”) with Anubis, whereby Anubis agreed to accept the sum of $35,000 (which is in addition to $30,000 paid by the Company in June 2016), in complete discharge of all amounts owed by the Company to Anubis.
 
During July 2016, the Company issued a promissory note in the amount of $82,500. The note was due in one month and is currently in default. The note contains an original issue discount in the amount of $7,500. The remaining balance due at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $82,500 and $-0-, respectively. The accrued interest on the note was $8,945 and $-0- at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
In September 2016, we entered into a factoring agreement, whereby we sold $14,590 in accounts receivable for $10,000.
 
On September 23, 2016, we sold Carebourn a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $63,825, representing $55,000 borrowed from Carebourn and an original issue discount of $8,325 (the “September 2016 Carebourn Convertible Note”, and together with the June 2016 Carebourn Convertible Note, the “Carebourn Convertible Notes”), pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated September 23, 2016. The September 2016 Carebourn Convertible Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (22% upon an event of default) and is due and payable on September 23, 2017.
 
The principal amount of the Carebourn Convertible Notes and all accrued interest is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into our common stock at any time following the 180th day after the applicable Carebourn Convertible Note was issued. The conversion price of the Carebourn Convertible Notes is equal to 50% of the average of the lowest three trading prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days prior to the conversion date.
