Item 1.Business
Overview of Embark
Embark develops technologically advanced autonomous driving software for the truck freight industry and offers a carefully constructed business model that is expected to provide the industry with the most attractive path to adopting autonomous driving. Specifically, Embark has developed a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) platform designed to interoperate with a broad range of truck original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) platforms, foregoing complicated and logistically challenging truck building or hardware manufacturing operations in favor of focusing on a superior driving technology. At scale, domestic shippers and carriers will be able to access Embark technology via a subscription software license selected as an option at the time they specify the build of new semi-trucks.
Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Embark’s history as the industry’s longest running autonomous truck driving program is replete with technological firsts that include, but are not limited to:

● | the first coast-to-coast autonomous truck drive,
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the first to reach 100,000 autonomous miles on public roads, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | the first to successfully open autonomous transfer points for human- autonomous vehicle (“AV”) hand off.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embark’s founding team includes roboticists and its broader team includes numerous computer scientists, many with advanced degrees and experience at other leading robotics and autonomous vehicle companies and academic programs. As of December 31, 2021, Embark had 231 employees and five contractors.
Embark has also spent considerable time and effort developing its business model. Embark is initially deploying its leading-edge technology in a very focused manner, by targeting freight highway miles between transfer points located next to metropolitan areas in the lower “Sunbelt” region of the United States (the “U.S.”) and leaving the “last mile” of driving to and from the transfer points to the industry’s highly skilled human drivers. Embark’s strategy is distinct from other industry players seeking to provide more complicated “end to end” autonomous driving solution that would entirely displace human drivers and potentially place these companies in competition with the industry’s carriers.
Embark’s business model focus does not come at any significant commercial expense for Embark’s stockholders because the serviceable market Embark is targeting is significant. Embark currently targets the rapidly growing $730 billion U.S. truck freight market, and builds technology to target 236 billion serviceable miles within this market. The industry has faced significant pressures from the growth of e-commerce and the well-documented shortage of skilled drivers, and therefore has powerful incentives to adopt autonomous driving solutions to both improve capacity and reduce costs. In addition, Embark’s cooperative model has already had traction with many of the industry’s leading shippers and carriers.
Embark believes the freight truck market is poised for a dramatic sea change that will result in an industry that is more profitable, less polluting and provides a more humane lifestyle for its skilled drivers thanks to autonomous driving technology.
Embark Can Address Many Challenges Faced by The Truck Freight Industry
Embark believes its offerings are well timed and will be attractive to a truck freight market that is under significant cost and capacity pressures including:

● | Driver Shortages. Carriers are facing driver shortages, particularly on long haul routes, as a result of an aging workforce and truck drivers’ preference for local routes that permit them to remain close to home. The American Trucking Association reported a shortage of 80,000 truck drivers in 2021, which is expected to reach a shortage of 160,000 drivers by 2030. As a result of this shortage, thousands of trucks have the potential to be left “against the fences” at large carriers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Economics. The truck freight industry is largely fragmented and highly price competitive. As a result, the market tends to be characterized by operating margins for incumbent carriers that are typically below 10%. Labor costs are the largest component of the per mile cost structure, representing 44% of total per mile semi-truck operating costs in 2021, according to the American Transportation Research Institute.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operational Safety. Operational safety remains a significant obstacle for carriers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), there were approximately 4,895 deaths in 2020 and 119,000 crashes causing injuries in 2019 that involved heavy trucks. In addition to loss of life, automotive accidents involving large trucks account for significant financial loss as a result of damaged and destroyed cargo.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evolving Consumer Demands. According to the American Trucking Association, freight volumes are expected to grow 25% between 2021 and 2032. In addition, the continued growth of e-commerce is driving expected delivery times down, requiring faster and more efficient delivery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Environmental Sustainability. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) estimates that truck freight accounted for 24% of automotive and over 7% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. in 2019. Carriers and shippers are increasingly focused on reducing carbon emissions associated with fleet operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embark’s Solutions to the Industry’s Challenges

● | Software Solution for Long Haul Trucking. Embark directly addresses driver shortage with a per-mile software license that can assist in the navigation of a carrier-owned, Embark-equipped OEM truck from its origin to destination. Implementation of Embark’s software will improve human driver quality of life by allowing drivers to service primarily local routes with Embark technology used to service long-haul portions of existing freight networks operated by carrier partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compelling Economics For Nearly Any Carrier. Embark believes that its autonomous driving solution provides compelling economics for carrier partners. Embark’s technology is designed to work on a wide range of semi-trucks through its proprietary Embark Universal Interface (“EUI”) technology. As a result, carriers can use the Embark technology to operate trucks for longer hours, with estimated annual revenue per truck meaningfully increased no matter what brand of trucks the carriers prefer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved Safety. A majority of all motor vehicle accidents are caused by human error. Autonomous driving directly addresses accidents involving large trucks that are attributable to human error. To date, Embark trucks have driven over one million “real world” miles without a U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) reportable safety incident.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved Speed of Delivery. USDOT regulations limit the time humans can drive trucks to 11 hours of operation per day. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically increase daily driving time and improve delivery speed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved Fleet Utilization. Autonomous vehicles that may be operated continuously allow carriers to “unlock” usage from their existing truck fleets during periods of the day that human drivers may not be able to drive. Increased utilization may permit carriers to own fewer trucks to serve the same demand, reducing their costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved Sustainability. Autonomous driving may improve fuel efficiency due to better speed management. supporting carrier and shipper sustainability objectives.

--+--------

As of December 31, 2021, Embark had 231 employees and five contractors. Prior to joining Embark, many of its employees had prior experience working for a wide variety of reputed technology organizations. 
Embark’s employees are at the center of its operating model and Embark has invested in building a strong relationship with its team. Embark continually strive to maintain a culture that promotes productivity, learning, development and positivity. Throughout its interview processes and as employees onboard, Embark stresses the importance for each employee to be entrepreneurial in shaping a positive culture at Embark and to make a conscious effort to create an environment of inclusion and belonging. Embark’s expectation is that its employees bring a positive presence to the team every day, and Embark has been successful in finding and building a team that believes in this vision.
Embark’s Business Model and Go-To-Market Strategy
Embark’s business model offers meaningful operational savings to carriers and shippers-collaborating rather than competing with carriers. To date, while not generating any revenue, Embark has completed hundreds of hauls with many major companies and has leveraged that experience into designing its business model and commercialization plans. Embark intends to make its technology available as a SaaS subscription on an OEM platform-agnostic basis, meaning that carriers will be able to subscribe to the Embark software for any new vehicles from any truck brand in their fleets. Embark believes this model will deliver compelling benefits across the entire trucking ecosystem by:

● | Improving economics and alleviating driver shortages for carriers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing fuel economy, reducing emissions and improving reliability, sustainability and safety for shippers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing an attractive cost of entry to autonomous vehicle technology without disrupting shippers’ or carriers’ truck preferences or supply chains; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Permitting Embark to focus on its area of expertise-autonomous driving development-while the rest of the ecosystem can specialize on the areas they excel in, including logistics and manufacturing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SaaS Focus
Embark partners with carriers and private fleets, who will pay a per-mile license fee for Embark’s software, which varies based on distance. In return, carriers and private fleets realize significant per-mile savings offered by the Embark Driver. This software focus is expected to allow Embark to scale rapidly by leveraging significant investments by carriers in trucks. Carrier investment significantly outpaces the resources of any single AV trucking player and Embark estimates that the top 100 carriers spend over $16.8 billion on new trucks annually based on an assumed 25% annual fleet turnover and an average truck price of $150,000.
In addition, by partnering with carriers as a software provider rather than competing with them by running its own freight network, Embark is able to leverage the expertise of its carrier partners while focusing on developing and maintaining state-of-the-art software. Furthermore, Embark expects to benefit from compelling SaaS economics including high margins, recurring revenues and economies of scale due to the increased demand for truck freight.
Embark may also seek revenue via ancillary channels, such as specialized hardware, maintenance and other services required as necessary to support its SaaS license model. Embark’s commercial model does not rely on revenue generated from OEMs and Embark has not entered into any agreement with an OEM to date that would provide for a revenue share for vehicles sold with Embark’s technology.

Platform Agnostic Technology
Through EUI, Embark is able to address the reality, that most major carriers run mixed fleets. Embark estimates that nearly 90% of the top 25 carriers run fleets with trucks provided by at least two OEMs and 50% run fleets with trucks provided by at least three OEMs. Ultimately, OEMs source components from multiple suppliers and carriers make final selections with regard to truck specifications.
Embark has engaged with all four major U.S. OEMs for many years, monitoring each manufacturer’s progress toward the development of proprietary “drive-by-wire” platforms that permit trucks to be controlled using electronic-rather than mechanical-control components. Drive-by-wire is an important advancement that facilitates the adoption of software-controlled semi-trucks. In connection with these OEM efforts, Embark has developed the EUI with flexible interfaces that are easily configured to integrate with each OEMs drive-by-wire platform. Embark expects that OEMs will ship their first trucks with redundant drive-by-wire platforms in the near future and is in close contact with OEMs as they select and source relevant sensor and compute options to be made available to carriers when they purchase new trucks. As with other components, Embark expects OEMs to move toward offering multiple AV options to carriers and has designed the EUI to address this eventual development.
Phased Rollout of Multiple Onboarding Methods
Embark expects to deploy its technology in two phases: (1) Phase 1 targeting the Sunbelt states, which see approximately 90 billion semi-truck miles annually, which is estimated based on the Freight Analysis Framework produced through a partnership between the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the Federal Highway Administration and (2) Phase 2 targeting all of the lower 48 states, which see approximately 300 billion semi- truck miles annually. Embark’s coverage map includes the full set of locations to which Embark Driver equipped trucks are able to travel. Embark is adding two types of locations to its coverage map, enabling two route models:

1. | Truck stops, which act as ideal transfer points that can be used by all carriers; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Highway-adjacent shipper locations, which allow Embark Driver-enabled trucks to travel direct-to- customer.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
With the transfer point model, Embark is able to focus on highway operations- the middle-mile- while Embark’s carrier partners conduct the first and last-mile portions with human drivers. These points will be located at existing facilities (e.g., truck stops) to provide a Day 1 drop-in solution for customers. Embark pioneered the transfer point model in 2017, partnering with Frigidaire and Ryder to deliver shipments. Since 2017, Embark has refined operations and now conducts multiple weekly shipments between Los Angeles and Phoenix on its research and development (“R&D”) truck fleet, demonstrating proof of concept and paving the way for commercialization and revenue generating operations in the future. However, Embark has not earned any revenue to date, and has incurred net losses of $21.5 million and $124.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
In conjunction with transfer points, Embark will offer direct-to-customer freight lanes for customers who already move a significant amount of freight on Embark’s network. In addition, PDP partners will work with Embark to refine and scale Embark’s software and support services. Embark has conducted network assessments for twelve major carriers and Fortune 500 shippers spanning the retail, consumer packaged goods, and automotive verticals who are committed to making self-driving freight operations a reality.
Offering two route methods addresses the economic reality of truck freight. Last mile transfers are projected to be economical for carriers shipping on lanes over 300 miles, whereas direct-to-customer transfers are expected to be economical for lanes in excess of 100 miles. By offering multiple route models, Embark is able to expand potential coverage for shippers and carriers and meet each of their specific needs.
Embark’s Technology
Embark’s technology solutions are designed to support the seamless integration of autonomous trucks into existing carrier fleets with the goal of alleviating the driver shortage, improving competitiveness for shippers, and improving unit economics for ecosystem participants. Its technology stack consists of three critical components, including the Embark Driver, the EUI, and the Embark Guardian. Together, these products make for a comprehensive, performant, and reliable freight solution, from sourcing to driving and support. Embark aims to showcase a L4 driverless solution in 2023 followed by plans to scale commercial operations throughout the Southwestern U.S. in 2024.

Products
Embark’s technology ecosystem is grounded in three key components: Embark Driver, EUI, and Guardian.

● | Embark Driver — Level 4 autonomous trucking software, available as a per mile subscription, safely and reliably pilots a carrier-owned, Embark-equipped OEM truck between designated transfer points within the Embark coverage map. The Embark Driver is a SaaS product that is continually improved from real world data using Embark’s active learning system, which automatically learns from the most relevant data that Embark-driven trucks encounter in the real world. The software was developed by Embark’s leading team of roboticists and machine learning engineers to have advanced prediction and planning capabilities, including an up to 60 second prediction horizon and the ability to simulate up to 1,200 scenarios involving the actions and interactions of the truck with road traffic. The Embark Driver software also utilizes proprietary Vision Map Fusion and scene understanding techniques that make it more capable of responding to real world driving conditions than systems that are reliant on mapping technology alone. These capabilities, amongst many others in Embark’s technology stack, facilitate a safe and efficient driving experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Embark Universal Interface — A set of standardized self-driving components and the flexible interfaces necessary for major truck OEMs (Volvo, Daimler, Navistar and PACCAR) to permit easy integration of Embark’s autonomous technology onto their vehicle platforms. Embark understands that its shipper and carrier customers value the opportunity to source trucks from different vendors and Embark’s strategy is to provide a path for AV adoption across a diversified fleet. EUI achieves compatibility, reliability and safety through a two part design-the component package and the interface package:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | The EUI component package includes a specification for a standardized set of sensors and computer systems so that the Embark Driver software can process road data from truck platforms with different characteristics in the same way. The component package consists of cameras, LiDARs, radars, GNSS, and IMUs, as well as the associated compute systems, which were selected following thorough testing procedures and analysis with the goal of achieving optimal performance and redundancy for a highly capable, safe, and reliable L4 autonomous truck solution.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | The EUI interface package consists of APIs that permit the Embark Driver software to interface with the EUI component package and the drive-by-wire system of any major OEM platform. By providing a standardized set of APIs, the Embark Driver software is truly “platform agnostic,” meaning it can control a diverse set of platforms, provided the platform can interoperate with the EUI interface package. This allows for direct communication to and control of any EUI-compatible truck’s steering, braking, and throttle actuators, as well as to the trucks’ telematics, power chassis, and HVAC.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Embark Guardian — The Guardian application is a SaaS-based autonomous fleet management solution that provides a visualization and monitoring interface to carriers as well as over-the-air updates, remote vehicle monitoring, remote vehicle assist, dispatching, and access to real-time data such as weather and construction. Embark Guardian permits operators to receive live camera and other feeds from the truck to observe performance and issues that may arise during autonomous driving. As a result, Embark Guardian is designed to provide carriers with the ability to seamlessly deploy and manage a fleet of autonomous trucks within their existing networks and can permit Embark to integrate more deeply into the operations of carrier partners to maximize value.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features
In addition to its core technology components, Embark has developed proprietary technical features that support the Embark Driver. These include:

● | Vision Map Fusion — Using proprietary techniques, Vision Map Fusion uses a non-linear optimization approach to fuse local data at the truck with global map geometry, enabling real-time map corrections. For example, Vision Map Fusion permits the truck to detect and react to road condition changes, such as work zones, in real time, even if the truck’s map data doesn’t show these conditions. Real-time map corrections to account for local conditions allow for improved accuracy and robustness of near field lane geometry estimation, while also unifying the corrected near field topology with the far field map to create a static scene used in downstream operations. This means that Embark’s self-driving system is less map reliant and more capable of handling the constantly changing road environment. The ability of Vision Map Fusion to update and correct map errors in real time can facilitate safer, more scalable and more efficient operations compared to alternative map- centric approaches.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Active Learning — Embark’s Active Learning system uses real world situations to rapidly improve performance. The Active Learning system applies a proprietary cloud-based selection engine to uploaded fleet data. The selection engine identifies “edge cases” from the truck’s real world driving data involving driving, road, weather, and/or other conditions that provide rich learning opportunities for Embark Driver’s artificial intelligence so that these edge cases can be studied to improve the Driver capabilities. The Active Learning system operates by uniformly sampling and analyzing the driver data for road and driving characteristics identified by Embark’s learning model as most beneficial to improving the Driver software’s performance. With the most valuable data automatically identified, Embark focuses the labeling and training efforts in a way to provide the quickest, most effective feedback loop for the Embark Driver to improve performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interactive Planning with Data Driven Predictions — The Embark Driver employs intelligent, adaptive prediction techniques to generate the best plan for each moment after simulating numerous potential scenarios and applying a prediction engine that looks into many potential future outcomes. At present, the Embark planning engine is capable of simulating up to 1,200 scenarios per second, using this information to build an up to 60 second planning horizon in which it looks ahead to see many possible outcomes from each potential driving decision. Using these data driven analytical models, the Embark Driver is able to accurately predict the actions of other road users and predict the optimal behavior in challenging driving situations. This allows the system to understand and account for real world driving conditions, such as cut-ins or sudden stops by other vehicles, and otherwise drive safely in busy traffic conditions.

Embark’s Partners and Ecosystem
Embark operates in an ecosystem consisting of shippers, carriers, OEMs, component part suppliers, and truck stop operators. Embark believes that its solutions provide meaningful benefits to all existing ecosystem players. Embark’s PDP prepares carriers to own and operate Embark autonomous trucks. In October 2021, Embark announced that carriers participating in Embark’s PDP have placed a combined 14,200 reservations for Embark-equipped autonomous trucks.
Carriers
Through its PDP, Embark has partnered with carriers to develop its offering and demonstrate proof of concept. To date, Embark has entered into non-binding agreements with nine carriers and shippers to demonstrate its ability to move freight on their existing networks. Through these relationships, Embark is able to leverage the decades-long truck freight expertise of its carrier partners in optimizing its autonomous vehicle technology and business model. Embark’s existing relationships with carriers also demonstrate to the rest of the market that a number of large carriers with significant fleets and operations have already recognized the potential value of adopting Embark Driver.
Embark estimates that these existing partners operate approximately 33,000 trucks and purchase approximately 8,000 trucks annually. Embark believes that its current carriers reflect a tiny fraction of the overall demand for its technology and Embark is in discussions with other carriers representing 50% of the top 100 carriers measured by truck count, which represent a meaningfully larger addressable market.
Shippers
In addition to partnering with carriers, Embark has fostered relationships with shippers across industry verticals such as retail, e-commerce, CPG and automotive. These shippers form the transportation demand that carriers fulfill. Embark’s autonomous vehicle technology provides meaningful benefits to shippers such as a reduction in CO2 emissions, an increase in speed and an improvement in safety. Embark has already worked with over half a dozen Fortune 500 shippers to analyze their transportation networks at a lane level and develop tactical plans for transitioning existing freight volume from manually driven trucks to Embark autonomous trucks operated by partner carriers. By engaging with shippers and carriers, Embark expects to facilitate the development of commercial scale for its technology.
OEMs
Embark’s relationships with OEMs have allowed it to develop the EUI. Each of the four major truck OEMs for the U.S. market are in the process of developing drive-by-wire platforms. Based on its relationships with each OEM, Embark anticipates that the EUI will be available for specification by carrier purchasers, similar to how OEMs provide optionality with respect to engine, brake and telematics solutions.

Real Estate Partners
Embark is working closely with a number of real estate partners such as truck stop operators and industrial real estate investment trusts to create a nationwide network of transfer hubs to support carriers who will operate the Embark Driver. By leveraging the existing real estate footprint of freight ecosystem partners, which is already aligned to trucking industry needs, Embark is able to significantly decrease the time, energy, and cost required to build out this transfer point network. In addition to serving the core transfer point function, Embark is also working with its real estate partners to make important ancillary services such as fuel, maintenance, and dispatch support available to carriers who will operate the Embark Driver.
Embark’s Competitive Strengths
Embark believes that the following strengths position it to capture growth in the autonomous trucking market and become a partner of choice for OEMs, carriers, and shippers:
Asset-Light SaaS Model is Durable and Scalable Across Large Addressable Market
Embark has designed an asset-light SaaS business model-licensing its software for a per-mile fee to carriers and shippers. Outside of an R&D fleet, Embark does not intend to own or operate trucks, removing a significant potential capital expenditure. This allows Embark to focus on software development and allows its carrier and shipper partners to focus on what they do best-maintaining and operating trucks and freight networks. Once a carrier or shipper specifies the EUI on a truck purchased from a preferred OEM, Embark will directly license the Embark Driver and provide ongoing support through Embark Guardian, thus driving durable relationships. Embark believes this model also provides Embark with predictable recurring revenues.
Through the PDP, Embark has developed its offering alongside carriers and shippers, establishing itself as a trusted technology partner. Embark has entered into non-binding agreements with a number of key carriers and estimates that its existing partners operate approximately 33,000 trucks and purchase approximately 8,000 trucks annually, which would comprise 91% of Embark’s 2024 scale targets, assuming full adoption. Given that Embark’s existing partners only comprise a small portion of the market and Embark is actively working to engage new partners, Embark believes it has significant upside on its targets in 2024 and beyond. For example, Embark is in discussions with carriers representing 50% of the top 100 carriers measured by truck count.
By partnering with carriers and shippers rather than competing with them, Embark is able to deploy its technology across existing truck freight networks and diverse groups of carriers. Leveraging existing freight networks will allow Embark to achieve scale more quickly across its addressable market. Similarly, through its partnerships with truck stop operators, Embark has the opportunity to capitalize on existing real estate portfolios to allow for rapid expansion of its coverage network.
The market for truck freight is large and growing. Embark estimates that the total addressable market for autonomous trucking is approximately 300 billion miles annually in the U.S. Of these miles, Embark estimates that approximately 236 billion miles would currently support Embark-enabled trucks.
​
Industry Leading Autonomous Trucking Technology. As the longest-running self-driving truck company, Embark is driving the transition to L4 autonomous trucking and pioneers an asset light partnership model focused on technology and SaaS. Embark believes its technology and business model has outpaced its competitors in establishing commercial viability:

● | First autonomous drive coast-to-coast;
--+---------------------------------------


● | First to 100,000 autonomous miles driven;
--+------------------------------------------

In addition, through its partnerships with shippers, carriers and OEMs, Embark has demonstrated broad industry acceptance of its technology and solutions.
Collaborative Business Model That Will Promote Regulatory and Industry Acceptance
Embark’s track record of industry collaboration. By working with Tier 1s, OEMs, carriers and shippers, Embark has developed a deep understanding of the existing freight ecosystem. It is this knowledge that drove Embark’s decision to work with, instead of compete against, existing freight players. In this collaborative model, Embark defers to OEMs for the manufacture and sale of the trucks themselves, carriers purchasing and operating the trucks and shippers buying capacity in a manner similar to today. This configuration leverages the logistical expertise of the carrier, allows the technology to scale more quickly through existing OEM-carrier-shipper relationships and enables Embark to focus on delivering a safe and reliable autonomous truck. By working within the current value chain structure, Embark leverages the public and regulator trust that OEMs, carriers and shippers have earned over decades of freight operations. Additionally, by creating value for existing players, and eliminating concerns of disintermediation, Embark is able to create powerful industry allies who advocate for their success with other ecosystem players.
Embark’s track record of regulatory collaboration. In 2018, Embark presented a novel approach to USDOT and FMCSA on how they could allow for autonomous truck operations under existing rules. This approach avoided the need for a multi-year rulemaking, while providing FMCSA with clear authority to continue ensuring public safety. Embark’s approach was broadly adopted in “Automated Vehicles 3.0” (“AV 3.0”), a USDOT guidance document issued in October 2018, and has since been reiterated in AV 4.0 (2019) and the USDOT AV Comprehensive Plan (2021). AV 3.0 represented the first time USDOT acknowledged that autonomous truck operation without a human driver is allowable, and that human- specific regulations would not apply.
Embark continues to be deeply engaged with government stakeholders in state legislatures, state departments of transportation, and state police. In 2021, Embark signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Arizona Department of Transportation to share information and best practices related to autonomous truck navigation of highway work zones. In addition, Embark has engaged in discussions with state regulators around the country on truck inspection procedures and has actively contributed to the passage of state legislation.
Embark also leads key industry public advocacy groups, including service as Co-Chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce AV Working Group, Co-Chair of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group AV Working Group, and is the first and only autonomous truck developer elevated to the Board of Directors of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (formerly known as Self-Driving Coalition), joining companies like Ford and Volvo Cars on the Board. Embark is also the longest- service autonomous trucking member of the American Trucking Associations and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance.
Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership
At Embark, Embark believes that leadership in environment, social and governance (“ESG”) issues are central to its mission to bring the first commercially-viable driverless truck to public roads. Embark has taken steps to address the environmental and social risks and opportunities of its operations and products. As Embark’s ESG efforts progress, it plans to report how it oversees and manage ESG factors, evaluating its ESG objectives by using industry-specific frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and elements of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”).
Embark’s ESG initiatives are organized into three pillars, which contain focus areas for its attention and action:

● | Environmental Pillar is focused on increasing fuel efficiency, reducing environmental impacts from Embark’s testing fleet (e.g. policies against idling, repurposing materials, waterless truck washing), and ensuring its data storage needs are powered sustainably.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Social Pillar is focused on upholding its commitment to driver safety and improved driver working conditions, supporting an engaged, talented and diverse workforce, collaborating on research projects with universities and supporting charitable foundations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Governance Pillar is focused on integrating enterprise risk management oversight across Embark’s data security and driver safety initiatives and sustaining a commitment to ethical business conduct, integrity, and responsibility.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Begin Significant L4 Driverless Operations Testing
--+---------------------------------------------------

Expand Partner Development Program
Embark anticipates leveraging its PDP to gain potential market share and expand geographic coverage with carriers and shippers. Embark has entered into non-binding agreements with a number of key carriers and shippers and is in active negotiation with a sufficient number of carriers and shippers to support its long term growth expectations. In addition, Embark is in discussions with key real estate players to add their truck stops to Embark’s coverage map.
Competition
Embark is the longest-running self-driving truck program in the U.S., which provides a competitive advantage. There are several competitors that have an AV trucking solution, including TuSimple, Aurora Innovation, and Waymo. Of the aforementioned, TuSimple is the only competitor that focuses on the trucking market, whereas Aurora Innovation and Waymo are also developing a robotaxi solution. Embark differentiates itself having developed a technology stack that is not over-reliant on HD Maps, and instead focuses on its patent-pending technology in Vision Map Fusion. Also, Embark has developed the Embark Universal Interface, which is a modular approach to hardware that allows the Embark Driver to work across multiple OEM Platforms. Lastly, Embark has an asset-light approach, and partners with a variety of constituents within the logistics and trucking ecosystem.
Some of Embark’s current and potential competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than Embark does. These competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development of their current and future technologies or the promotion and sale of their offerings, or to offer lower prices. Embark’s current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships amongst themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings. However, Embark’s focus, from its founding, on the AV trucking market we believe provides a competitive advantage and has allowed Embark to be highly capital efficient in developing its technology.

13



Embark believes its ability to compete successfully as a provider of AV trucking services does and will depend on a number of factors including the price of its offerings, consumer confidence in its technology, its ability to execute on its strategy and the continued economic viability of its business model. Embark believes that it competes favorably on the basis of these factors.
Government Regulation
Embark’s public policy strategy is oriented around three goals:
•Ensure current Embark testing operations remain allowable under federal/state laws;
•Ensure future deployment of Embark driverless trucks are allowable under federal/state laws; and
•Mitigate any emergent political/policy risks that could affect Embark’s plans or business model.
Embark has crafted federal and state policy strategies that support these goals by leveraging key industry groups and other allies while solidifying Embark’s position as an industry leader. Embark is the longest- running self-driving truck program, and has been proactively engaged with government stakeholders nearly from our beginning, affording us long-standing relationships with both political leadership and career staff at key regulatory agencies. Embark has a track record of success in advocating on behalf of the industry, serving as a leading voice on state and federal policy and legislative issues. Embark intends to continue to invest in these efforts to maintain its leadership in the public policy arena.
Intellectual Property
Embark relies on a combination of intellectual property, primarily trade secrets and copyrights, to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. In addition, Embark relies on significant technical measures, including the fact that its software is maintained securely in a proprietary cloud environment and is not accessible by customers, component suppliers or competitors in its current development and scale-up phase. Employee devices are encrypted and closely protected, with administrative controls to remotely lock or wipe compromised devices, while at the same time revoking credentials for individual employees with access to its internal systems. In addition, Embark employs physical security measures and employment processes to maintain the security of its physical assets and the integrity of its trade secrets and copyrighted source code.
Embark also protects its proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Embark requires its employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements through which they agree to maintain confidentiality and, as applicable, agree to assign to Embark any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them for Embark. In addition, Embark enters into confidentiality agreements with its vendors, commercial partners and potential customers.
Embark will also file patent applications on certain key aspects of its proprietary software, and intends to pursue patent protection on certain key aspects of its technology as it transitions into its commercial phase and potential concerns about publication through patents become less acute. Embark also pursues trademark protection and is the registered holder of several domain registrations and will continue to invest in and grow its brand protection assets over time. Although Embark relies on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect its proprietary rights, Embark believes it is its team’s ability to execute-by scaling its business and executing on its technology and commercial development activities, that will maintain its market leadership position.
