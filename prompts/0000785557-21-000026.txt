ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
DLH Holdings Corp. is a provider of technology-enabled business process outsourcing, program management solutions, and public health research and analytics; primarily focused to improve and better deploy large-scale federal health and human service initiatives. The Company derives 99% of its revenue from agencies of the Federal government, providing services to several agencies including the Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA"), Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), and the Department of Defense ("DoD"). Incorporated in New Jersey in 1969, the Company contracts with its government customers through its subsidiaries.
In recent years we have successfully completed acquisitions to increase future organic growth, diversify our customer base, and to expand into adjacent markets. On September 30, 2020, we acquired Irving Burton Associates, LLC ("IBA") and on June 7, 2019, we acquired Social & Scientific Systems, Inc. ("S3").
Our business offerings are aligned to three market focus areas within the federal health services market space.
•Defense and Veteran Health Solutions;
•Human Services and Solutions;
•Public Health and Life Sciences
Defense and Veterans’ Health Solutions: DLH provides critical healthcare, technology, and logistics solutions to the VA, Defense Health Agency ("DHA"), Tele-medicine and Advanced Technology Research Center ("TATRC"), Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, and the Army Medical Research and Material Command ("MRDC"). We specialize in supporting our customers' evolving needs by rapidly deploying resources and solutions. 
The VA is responsible for delivering medical, educational, financing and other life event services to an estimated 20.3 million veterans. There are over 9 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care program which provides services that include the 
distribution of prescription drugs from the network of regional processing centers. We are at the forefront of ensuring that veterans receive their out-patient prescriptions on time, each day, through the VA CMOP pharmacy program which has been recognized for service excellence, earning the JD Powers evaluation of mail order pharmacies multiple times over recent years. Further, we have supported the VA's efforts to broaden its abilities to reach veterans and their families through telemedicine technology and practices. 
The DHA is a joint, integrated combat support agency whose mission is to provide a medically ready force to the Army, Navy, and Air Force. To execute this mission the DHA supports the delivery of integrated, affordable and high quality health services to the armed forces. We support their mission by providing leading technology-enabled solutions and services. These solutions and services encompass new capabilities at the forefront of technology to include artificial intelligence, machine learning, heath informatics, and robotics. 
Human Services and Solutions: Our customers support local communities by promoting economic, educational, and social well-being of children. The mission extends to international communities through the prevention of epidemic diseases, response to natural disasters, and development of local economies. We support our customers by providing a wide range of services and solutions to HHS, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), and the Department of State ("State"). Our range of services support the critical missions of these agencies and their respective operating divisions, to include the Office of Head Start ("OHS"), Administration for Children and Families ("ACF"), the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"), and the United States Agency of International Development ("USAID"). In this market, we combine subject matter expertise with our experience in information technology and analytics to provide large-scale program monitoring and evaluation; electronic medical records migration; data collection and management; and nutritional and social health assessments. Additionally, we also provide large-scale data analytics as well as enterprise-level IT system architecture design, migration planning, and ongoing management of system implementation and capacity building using experienced subject matter experts and project management resources. 
FEMA is charged with supporting the nation before, during and after disasters. They execute their mission by building a culture of preparedness and readying the nation for catastrophic disasters. FEMA supports state and local government in their response to disasters by coordinating the federal government's response to the local jurisdiction and deploying resources to the areas of need. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have supported FEMA's efforts by rapidly deploying specialty resources to support resource constrained health-care providers.
Public Health and Life Sciences: In this market, our customers support national interests by ensuring and enhancing our capability to fight diseases, respond to national and regional medical crises, and support the administration of providing health care benefits to senior and at-risk members of our communities. In support of this mission, we provide services to multiple operating divisions within HHS, including National Institutes of Health ("NIH"), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC"), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). Many of these agencies are engaged to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of capacities and we have partnered with our customers to deliver solutions that allow the nation and its people to combat the pandemic and sustain operations and services.
Our services include clinical trials, epidemiology studies, advancing disease prevention methods and health promotion to underserved and at-risk communities. We deliver our services through development of strategic communication campaigns, research on emerging trends, health informatics analyses, and application of best practices including mobile, social, and interactive media. We leverage evidence-based methods and web technology to drive health equity to our most vulnerable populations through public engagement. Projects often involve highly specialized expertise and research methodologies.

Capabilities and certifications
We continue to invest in credentials that drive excellence in our support to current clients and create differentiation as we compete in this space. These investments include development of secure IT platforms, sophisticated data analytic tools and techniques, and implementation of a lean six sigma environment. We are actively pursuing additional credentials that will support our customer's needs in providing a secure cloud computing environment.
Our Infinibyte® Cloud solution has achieved FedRAMP In Process status and received agency authorization. It is currently under review by the General Services Administration ("GSA") review for being listed on the public market place, further enhancing our ability to demonstrate our technical expertise and offer our customers a secure cloud environment. We have invested in agile software development credentials for our technical staff, and have achieved Capability Maturity Model Integration ("CMMI") level 3. We believe that these qualifications will further enhance our value propositions for current programs, as well as future business we pursue. In addition, we continue to build upon our heritage of excellent customer satisfaction in support of key federal programs. We have achieved Joint Commission certification for the safety and quality of our healthcare services delivery against national standards. These nationally recognized best practices certifications demonstrate our commitment to continuous improvement and performance excellence that is critical to our organic growth objectives.
Position and Distribution of Services and Solutions in Our Markets
The markets in which we compete and the manner in which we are positioned within them are characterized by a number of features including, but not limited to: 
•specialized credentials and licenses held by a substantial component of our employee base;
•primarily performing from the prime contractor position in contracts;
•strong past performance record, as evidenced by our VA customer scoring the highest in overall satisfaction in the J.D. Power National Pharmacy Study multiple times in recent years; and 
•targeted expansion in critical national priority markets with Federal budget stability to include public health and epidemiological support related to COVID-19.
We operate primarily through prime contracts awarded by the government through competitive bidding processes. We have a diverse mix of contract vehicles with various agencies of the United States Government, which supports our overall corporate growth strategy. Our revenue is distributed to time and materials contracts (75%), cost reimbursable contracts (20%) and the remaining are firm fixed price contracts (5%). We also provide services under Indefinite Duration, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") and government wide acquisition contracts, such as GSA schedule contracts. The Company currently holds multiple GSA schedule contracts, under which we provide services that constitute a significant percentage of our total revenue. These Federal contract schedules are renewed on a recurring basis for multi-year periods.
Major Customers
A major customer is defined as a customer from whom we derive at least 10% of our revenues. The following table summarizes the revenues by customer for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively:

 | Year Ended 
 | September 30,
 | | 2021 | | 2020
(Amounts in thousands) | | Revenue | Percent of total revenue | | Revenue | Percent of total revenue
Department of Veterans Affairs | | $ | 110,078 | | 45 | % | | $ | 100,204 | | 48 | %
Department of Health and Human Services | | 91,543 | | 37 | % | | 95,026 | | 45 | %
Department of Defense | | 30,930 | | 13 | % | | 1,303 | | 1 | %
Customers with less than 10% share of total revenue | | 13,543 | | 5 | % | | 12,652 | | 6 | %
Total revenue | | $ | 246,094 | | 100 | % | | $ | 209,185 | | 100 | %

Major Contracts
The revenue attributable to the VA customers was derived from 16 separate contracts for our performance of pharmacy and logistics services in support of the VA’s consolidated mail outpatient pharmacy program. Nine contracts for pharmacy services, which represent approximately $62.8 million and $56.5 million of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, are currently operating under a bridge contract through October 2022.
As previously reported, a single renewal request for proposal (“RFP”) had been issued for the nine (9) pharmacy contracts that required the prime contractor be a service-disabled veteran owned small business (“SDVOSB”), which would have precluded us from bidding on the RFP as a prime contractor. We had joined a SDVOSB team as a subcontractor to respond to this RFP. However, the government has canceled the previously issued RFP for these contracts. The government has neither indicated nor announced its future procurement strategy. Due to the time required to conduct a procurement process, we expect these contracts to be further extended.
The remaining seven contracts for logistics services represent approximately $47.2 million and $43.7 million of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. In April 2021, we were awarded a follow-on contract to provide medical logistics to the VA's CMOP program. The contract award was protested and subsequently canceled during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. The contract award was canceled in accordance with procurement requirements to allow the government sufficient time to address administrative concerns raised in the protest about the procurement process. Once the government completes this process, we expect to be awarded a new contract. In the interim, the existing contract has been extended through November 2022.
Our contract with HHS in support of the Head Start program generated $28.2 million and $32.4 million of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This contract has a period of performance through April 2025.
Backlog
Backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly multi-year government contracts and will vary depending upon the timing of new/renewal contract awards. Backlog is based upon customer commitments that we believe to be firm over the remaining performance period of our contracts. The value of multi-client, competitive Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") contract awards is included in backlog computation only when a task order is awarded or if the contract is a single award IDIQ contract. While no assurances can be given that existing contracts will result in earned revenue in any future period, or at all, our major customers have historically exercised their contractual renewal options. At September 30, 2021, our total backlog was approximately $651.5 million compared to $688.4 million as of September 30, 2020.
Backlog value is quantified from management's judgment and assumptions about the volume of services based on past volume trends and current planning developed with customers. Our backlog may consist of both funded and unfunded amounts under existing contracts including option periods. At September 30, 2021, our funded backlog was approximately $191.0 million and our unfunded backlog was $460.5 million.
Competitive Landscape
Competitive solicitations and long business development cycles are characteristics of the government and defense industry in which we operate. For major program competition, the business acquisition cycle typically ranges from 18 to 36 months. Companies may pursue work either as prime contractor or partner with other companies in a subcontractor role. Those competing as prime contractors normally expend substantially more resources than those in subcontractor roles. We partner and compete with several large and small-business companies in pursuit of acquiring new business.
We built Infinibyte® Cloud as a platform-as-a-service cloud computing offering. It delivers a platform to U.S. government agencies, enabling them to develop, run, and manage applications without the need to build and maintain the underlying infrastructure. Infinibyte Cloud provides the networks, servers, storage, operating systems, middleware, databases, and other services for hosting government applications and data. Infinibyte Cloud is currently in process for FedRAMP, the government’s rigorous security compliance framework which provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud service providers who host services used by the U.S. government, authorization and has received ready status. The solution is currently available on the FedRAMP marketplace.
Our competitors include operating units within, among others: Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., CACI International, Inc., ICF International, Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., Mantech International Corp., MAXIMUS, Inc., UnitedHealth Group, Inc. operating under Optum, RTI International, and Westat, Inc.
We compete with these companies by leveraging our differentiating suite of tools and uniquely integrating people and processes resulting in highly competitive proposals and a solid track record of past performance. We believe that our proprietary tools and processes, including e-PRAT® and SPOT-m®, along with our Infinibyte® cloud-based management system differentiate us from our competitors. We compete for awards through a full and open competition on a best-value basis. We draw heavily from our consistently high-quality past performance ratings, proven and evolving technical differentiators, key personnel credentials and growing market recognition to compete. We believe that our track record, knowledge and processes with respect to government contract bidding represent significant competitive advantages. Further, we believe that the range and depth of educational experience and professional credentials and certifications held by our employees allows us to deploy highly-qualified teams to implement solutions to address the needs of our customers. Our recent and future success in this competitive landscape hinges on our ability to continue to uniquely integrate people, processes and technology tools to deliver best value solutions for our targeted clients (both government and industry partners).
Additionally, the Federal government may elect to restrict certain procurements, including renewals of our current contracts, to bidders that qualify for certain special statuses such as veteran owned, small, or small disadvantaged businesses. For those procurements, we would be limited to a subcontractor role.
Intellectual Property
Because our business involves providing services to government entities, our operations generally are not substantially dependent upon obtaining and/or maintaining copyright or trademark protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. We claim copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. We hold the registered trademarks, e-PRAT® and SPOT-m®, for our offerings that optimize resource allocation and supply chain management processes in connection with our business process management services, as well as the registered trademark, Infinibyte®, for our cloud-based solution. We maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets adequate protection to ensure their continuing availability.
Government Regulation
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. In addition, many federal and state laws materially affect our operations. These laws relate to ethics, labor, tax, and employment matters. As any employer is, we are subject to federal and state statutes and regulations governing their standards of business conduct with the government, including that government contracts typically contain provisions permitting government clients to terminate contracts without cause with limited notice or compensation. The development of additional statutes and regulations and interpretation of existing statutes and regulations with respect to our industry can be expected to evolve over time. Through its corporate membership with the Professional Services Council and other affiliations, we monitor proposed and pending regulations from relevant congressional committees and government agency policies that have potential impact upon our industry and our specific strategically targeted markets. As with any commercial enterprise, we cannot predict with certainty the nature or direction of the development of Federal statutes and regulations that will affect its business operations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.
Human Capital Management and Employee Relations
As of September 30, 2021, we employed over 2,300 employees performing in over 30 locations throughout the U.S. and one location overseas. Management believes that it has good relations with its employees. In October 2014, employees at our Chicago location approved the adoption of union representation for non-management employees. Union representation has been certified for these employees and collective bargaining discussions are ongoing. Management does not expect this agreement to materially impact results of operations.
We seek to attract and retain the best people by providing them with opportunities to grow, build skills, and be appreciated for their contributions as they work to serve our clients. Our employees are critical to our success and are the reason we continue to execute at a high level. We believe our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality insights and information to our clients. 
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including competitive benefits arrangement to address healthcare needs, including health insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and family care resources. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having our employees work from home when possible, implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work, and supporting our employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccination within appropriate medical and religious bounds. In addition, we are monitoring potential impacts and will implement new protocols, when needed, related to the vaccination requirements imposed by the Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors signed by President Biden on September 9, 2021.
We provide competitive compensation programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include annual bonuses, stock awards, and participation in a 401(k) Plan. We have used targeted equity-based grants with performance-based vesting conditions to facilitate retention of key personnel. We also invest in talent development initiatives, to include industry-leading learning management, professional credentialing, and applicant tracking systems. These will further enhance our highly qualified employee base and augment our efforts to infuse top talent into our operations through world-class recruiting and talent management tools.
