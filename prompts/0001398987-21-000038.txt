Item 1.    Business. 
Our Company 
We are the leading and most integrated provider of residential real estate services in the U.S. We are the world's largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages with some of the most recognized brands in the real estate industry, the leading U.S. residential real estate brokerage (based upon transaction volume), and a significant provider of title agency and underwriting services. We also own a minority interest in a joint venture that provides mortgage origination services.
The core of our integrated business strategy is to grow the base of productive independent sales agents at our company owned and franchisee brokerages and provide them and their clients with compelling data and technology-powered products and services, including high-quality lead generation programs, to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable.
Our revenue is derived on a fee-for-service basis, and given our breadth of complementary service offerings, we are able to generate fees from multiple aspects of a residential real estate transaction, in many different geographies and varying price points.
Segment Overview
We report our operations in three segments, each of which receives fees based upon services performed for our customers: 
•Realogy Franchise Group. We are the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world through our portfolio of well-known, industry-leading franchise brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. This segment also includes our lead generation and global relocation services operations.
•Realogy Brokerage Group. We own and operate the leading residential real estate brokerage business (based upon transaction volume) in the U.S. primarily under the Coldwell Banker®, Corcoran® and Sotheby's International Realty® brand names. 
•Realogy Title Group. We are a full-service title, escrow and settlement services agency serving real estate companies, corporations and financial institutions primarily in support of residential real estate transactions. Our title insurance underwriter, Title Resources Guaranty Company, provides title underwriting services relating to the closing of home purchases and refinancing of home loans, working with agents affiliated with the Company and independent agents. This segment also includes our share of equity earnings from our Guaranteed Rate Affinity mortgage origination joint venture.
Inclusion of Cartus Relocation Services in Continuing Operations
The results of our global relocation operations, Cartus Relocation Services, were presented as discontinued operations commencing in the fourth quarter of 2019 pending the sale of that business to a third party. However, during the fourth quarter of 2020, following termination of the proposed sale of that business and change in the company's expectations for sale, management determined that the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria in ASC Topic 360 and ASC Topic 205 were no longer met. As a result, the assets and liabilities of Cartus Relocation Services, previously presented as held for sale, have been reclassified to held and used on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and the results of Cartus Relocation Services have been reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations and included in the Realogy Franchise Group segment for all periods presented (see Note 18, "Segment Information", to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).
Effective in the first quarter of 2020, Realogy Leads Group, our leads generation business (previously included within the Cartus Relocation Services segment) was consolidated into Realogy Franchise Group.
Housing Market and Market Share
U.S. Gross Commission Income. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a sales commission earned from closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction), which we refer to as gross commission income. We believe that the level of gross commission income generated in the U.S., which is generally estimated around $80 billion, represents a substantial addressable market. Our company owned brokerages and franchisees earned approximately $14 billion in gross commission income in 2020, as compared to $12 billion in gross commission income in 2019.
Market Share. As measured in a comparison to the volume of all existing homesale transactions in the U.S. as reported by NAR (regardless of whether an agent or broker was involved in the transaction), we estimate that our market share in 2020 remained flat at approximately 15.3% as compared year-over-year to 2019. Although market share was flat for the year, we did have market share growth in the second half of 2020, as market share had been 14.8% for the trailing twelve month period ended June 30, 2020.
Our estimated share of all U.S. existing homesale unit transactions in 2020 decreased from approximately 13.0% to approximately 12.6%.
Basis of Market Share Calculation. We measure our market share transaction volume by the ratio of (a) homesale transaction volume (sides times average price) in which we and our franchisees participate to (b) NAR's existing homesale transaction volume (regardless of whether an agent or broker was involved in the transaction)—calculated by doubling the number of existing homesale transactions reported by NAR to account for both the buy and sell sides of a transaction 
multiplied by NAR's average sales price. Homesale unit transaction market share is calculated similarly but without including average sales price in either the numerator or denominator.

Industry Trends 
Industry definition.  We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which is approximately a $2.2 trillion industry based on 2020 transaction volume (i.e., average homesale price times number of new and existing homesale transactions) and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than new homes manufactured and sold by homebuilders. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segments of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:
•the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 6.5 million homesales in the U.S. in 2020, NAR estimates that approximately 5.6 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 87% of the overall sales as measured in units;
•existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and
•we are able to generate revenues from ancillary services provided to our customers.
Our business model relies heavily on affiliated independent sales agents, who play a critical consumer-facing role in the home buying and selling experience for both our company owned and franchise brokerages. While substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the Internet, according to NAR, approximately 88% of home buyers and home sellers used an agent or broker in 2020. We believe that agents or brokers will continue to be directly involved in most home purchases and sales, primarily because real estate transactions have certain characteristics that benefit from the service and value offered by an agent or broker, including the following:
•the average homesale transaction value is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;
•homesale transactions occur infrequently;
•there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;
•a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process, including specific marketing and technology services; 
•the consumer preference to visit properties for sale in person, notwithstanding the availability of on-line images and property tours; and
•there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space. 
Cyclical nature of industry.  The U.S. residential real estate industry is cyclical but has historically shown strong growth over time. According to NAR, the existing homesale transaction volume (median homesale price times existing homesale transactions) grew at a CAGR of 5.8% over the past 30 years. 
The U.S. residential real estate industry was in a significant and lengthy downturn from the second half of 2005 through 2011. Based upon data published by NAR from 2005 to 2011, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale transactions declined by 40% and the median existing homesale price declined by 24%. Beginning in 2012, the U.S. residential real estate industry began a recovery. Based upon data published by NAR from 2011 to 2020, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale units and the median existing homesale price improved by 32% and 79%, respectively.
In 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. residential real estate industry experienced significant volatility with a 16% decline in closed homesale transaction volume (existing homesale average price times existing homesale transactions) in the second quarter of 2020 followed by a 29% increase in closed homesale transaction volume in the second half of 2020, in each instance as compared to the prior year according to NAR. We cannot predict the duration or continued strength of the housing recovery seen in the second half of 2020.
Long-term demographics.  We believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is primarily driven by the affordability of housing, the economic health of the U.S. economy, demographic trends such as generational transitions, increases in U.S. household formation, mortgage rate levels and mortgage availability, certain tax benefits, job growth, increases in renters that qualify as homebuyers, the inherent attributes of homeownership versus renting and the availability of inventory in the consumer's desired location and within the consumer's price range. We believe that the residential real estate market will benefit over the long-term from expected positive fundamentals, including expected growth in the number of U.S. households over the next decade, in particular among the millennial generation.
Participation in Multiple Aspects of the Residential Real Estate Market
We participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our complementary businesses and mortgage origination joint venture work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation and lead generation services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships with real estate brokers, sales agents and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and real estate benefit program clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. Specifically, our brokerage offices and those of our franchisees participate in purchases and sales of homes involving relocations of corporate transferees through Realogy Leads Group, we offer customers (purchasers and sellers) of both our owned and franchised brokerage businesses convenient title, escrow and settlement services (including the provision of title underwriting policies). These services produce incremental revenues for our businesses and franchisees. In addition, we participate in the mortgage process through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity. All of our businesses and our mortgage joint venture can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.

Realogy Franchise Group
Overview—Franchise Business 
Realogy Franchise Group is comprised of our franchise business as well as our leads generation and relocation operations.
As of December 31, 2020, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 320,700 independent sales agents worldwide, including approximately 190,700 independent sales agents operating in the U.S. (which included approximately 53,100 company owned brokerage independent sales agents). As of December 31, 2020, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 20,100 offices worldwide in 116 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 5,800 brokerage offices in the U.S. (which included approximately 670 company owned brokerage offices).
As shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2020, independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned brokerages grew by 2% (based on the Company’s internal data) and independent sales agents affiliated with our franchised brokerages remained flat (based on information provided by our affiliated franchisees), in each case as compared to December 31, 2019.
The average tenure among our U.S. franchisees is approximately 22 years as of December 31, 2020. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with dedicated national marketing and servicing programs, technology, training, education, learning and development to facilitate our franchisees in growing their business and increasing their revenue and profitability.
Our primary objectives as the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world are to retain and expand existing franchises, sell new franchises, and most importantly, provide branding and support to our franchisees and their independent sales agents.
Operations—Franchising
We derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties and marketing fees received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees and Realogy Brokerage Group for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales commission earned from closed homesale sides, which we refer to as gross commission income.
Realogy Franchise Group's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Realogy Brokerage Group) can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction) in which those franchisees participated by (2) 
the average sale price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) Realogy Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate. Realogy Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved (or, for certain franchisees, flat fee or capped royalties) and net of other incentives granted to franchisees. 
The domestic royalty revenue from Realogy Brokerage Group is calculated by multiplying homesale sides by average sale price by average brokerage commission rate by their contractual royalty rate. Realogy Brokerage Group does not receive volume incentives or other incentives. In addition to domestic royalty revenue, Realogy Franchise Group earns revenue from marketing fees, the preferred alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees.
During 2020, none of our franchisees (other than Realogy Brokerage Group) generated more than 1.5% of the total revenue of our real estate franchise business.
Domestic Franchisees. Franchise agreements set forth guidelines on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the mandatory identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years, although we may negotiate shorter extension agreements with existing franchisees.
These franchisee agreements generally require the franchisee to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus a royalty fee that is a percentage of gross commission income, if any, earned by the franchisee. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways and we may, from time to time, restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands.
Most of our brands utilize a volume-based incentive model with a royalty fee that is initially equal to 6% of the franchisee's gross commission income, but subject to reduction based upon volume incentives. Under this model, the franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. The volume incentive varies for each franchise system, and generally results in a net or effective royalty rate of 6% to 3% for each individual franchisee (prior to taking into account other incentives that may be applicable to the franchisee). We provide a detailed table to each eligible franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations.
Certain franchisees (including some of our largest franchisees) have a flat percentage royalty fee model. Under this model, franchisees pay a fixed percentage (generally less than 6%) of their commission income to us and the percentage does not change during the year or over the term of their franchise agreement. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.
Since 2019, our Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand has utilized a capped fee model, which applies to any new franchisee as well as preexisting franchisees who elect to switch from their current royalty fee structure to the capped fee model. Under this model, franchisees pay a royalty fee (generally equal to 5% of their commission income) capped at a set amount per independent sales agent per year, subject to our right to annually modify or increase the independent sales agent cap. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives. 
Beginning with their launch in 2019, our Corcoran brand utilizes a tiered fee model, which requires franchisees to pay us a percentage of their gross commission income as a royalty fee. The royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 6% and decreases in steps during each calendar year as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels to a minimum of 4%. We reserve the right to annually modify or increase the gross commission income level amounts, subject to certain limitations. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.
Other incentives may be used as consideration to attract new franchisees, grow franchisees (including through independent sales agent recruitment) or extend existing franchise agreements. Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales agents and offices operated by independent brokerages. Franchisees may also use the 
proceeds from the conversion notes to update marketing materials or upgrade technology and websites. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed, and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance-based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met, franchisees may be required to repay a portion of the outstanding notes.
Each of our current franchise systems require franchisees and company owned brokerages to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand, which may decrease as certain financial thresholds are achieved in accordance with the applicable franchise agreement. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, in certain instances, Realogy Franchise Group may be required to make contributions to certain marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.
In addition to offices owned and operated by our third-party franchisees, as of December 31, 2020, we, through Realogy Brokerage Group, own and operate approximately 670 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® brand names. Realogy Brokerage Group pays intercompany royalty fees of approximately 6% and marketing fees to Realogy Franchise Group in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment level and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses. Realogy Brokerage Group does not participate in volume incentive or other incentive programs.
International Third-Party Franchisees. In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators.  We also utilize a direct franchising model outside of the U.S. for Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® and, in some cases, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate®. For all other brands, we generally employ a master franchise model outside of the U.S., whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. Under both the direct and the master franchise model outside of the U.S., we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties.  Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region.
Intellectual Property 
We own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant franchised operations.
We have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's ("Sotheby's"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by Realogy Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices. Our license agreement is terminable by Sotheby's prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, (3) a court issues a non-appealable, final judgment that we have committed certain breaches of the license agreement and we fail to cure such breaches within 60 days of the issuance of such judgment, or (4) we discontinue the use of all of the trademarks licensed under the license agreement for a period of twelve consecutive months.
In October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith Corporation ("Meredith"). The license agreement between Realogy and Meredith is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meredith 
for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by Realogy Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee. Our license agreement is terminable by Meredith prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, or (3) a trial court issues a final judgment that we are in material breach of the license agreement or any representation or warranty we made was false or materially misleading when made.
Operations—Other
Lead Generation Programs. Through Realogy Leads Group, a part of Realogy Franchise Group, we seek to provide high-quality leads and improve the conversion rate of leads to closed homesale transactions. Realogy Leads Group includes real estate benefit programs that provide home-buying and selling assistance to members of organizations such as credit unions and interest groups that have established members who are buying or selling a home as well as to consumers and corporations who have expressed interest in a certain brand, product or service (such as relocation services), including those offered by Realogy. Where permitted by law, consumers participating in certain real estate benefit programs can receive a financial incentive for using these services (such as cash or a gift card, or real estate brokerage commission credit based on the home purchase/sale price pursuant to the applicable program). Realogy Leads Group also directs our broker-to-broker business, pursuant to which brokers affiliated with one of our customized agent and brokerage networks refer business to other in-network brokers.
Our real estate benefit program revenues are highly concentrated, with one client-directed real estate benefit program contributing a substantial majority of the high-quality leads generated through our lead generation programs, and our client-directed programs are non-exclusive and terminable at any time at the option of the client. We also maintain Realogy-driven real estate benefit programs, including: Realogy Military Rewards, a program for U.S. military personnel, veterans and their families that seeks to provide access to benefits from Realogy that are similar to those offered under the former USAA real estate benefit program which was discontinued in 2019; and AARP® Real Estate Benefits, the first-ever real estate benefits program designed for the nearly 38 million AARP members, which was launched in 2020. We expect that significant time and effort and meaningful investment will be required to increase awareness of and consumer participation in new real estate benefit programs.
To service the needs of consumers and clients participating in one of our real estate benefit programs (including our relocation program with Cartus Relocation Services) or engaged through a broker-to-broker lead, we manage customized agent and brokerage networks, including the Realogy Advantage Broker Network. Our networks consist of real estate brokers, including our company owned brokerage operations, select franchisees and independent real estate brokers who have been approved to become members. Member brokers of our networks receive leads from our real estate benefit programs (including via our relocation program with Cartus Relocation Services) and each other in exchange for a fee paid to Realogy Leads Group. The Realogy Advantage Broker Network closed approximately 46,200 real estate transactions in 2020, with substantially all of the closed transactions handled by independent sales agents affiliated with our franchisees and company-owned brokerages.
Cartus Relocation Services. Cartus Relocation Services, a provider of global relocation services, offers a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for employee and employer. The wide range of services we offer allow our clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us. Our broad array of services include, but are not limited to homesale assistance, relocation policy counseling and group move management services, expense processing and relocation-related accounting, and visa and immigration support. We also arrange household goods moving services and provide support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods.
We primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, including 50% of the Fortune 50 companies in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 20 years with us. Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. If a client ceases or reduces volume under its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time that volume ceases and reimbursed for all expenses incurred.
There are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn a fee from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. Furthermore, Cartus Relocation Services continues to provide value through the generation 
of leads to real estate agent and brokerage participants in the networks maintained by Realogy Leads Group, which drives downstream revenue for our businesses.
Preferred Alliance Program. We offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales agents and customers through our preferred alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales agents and to pay us a combination of an initial licensing or access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales agents' usage of the preferred alliance vendors.
Realogy Brokerage Group 
Overview
Through Realogy Brokerage Group we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in many of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our brokerage offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, primarily around large metropolitan areas in the U.S., where home prices are generally higher. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® franchised brands.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 670 company owned brokerage offices and approximately 53,100 independent sales agents working with these company owned offices. Of those offices, we operated approximately 90% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, approximately 6% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and 4% of our offices under the Corcoran® brand name.
We intend to grow our business organically. To grow organically, we focus on working with office managers to attract and retain independent sales agents who can successfully engage and promote transactions from new and existing clients. To a lesser extent, we may grow our business through strategic acquisitions. Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations to reduce or eliminate duplicative costs and to leverage our existing infrastructure to support newly affiliated independent sales agents.
Operations
Our company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.43% which represents the average commission rate earned on either the "buy" side or the "sell" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. Realogy Brokerage Group, as a franchisee of Realogy Franchise Group, pays marketing fees and a royalty fee of approximately 6% of the gross commission income earned per real estate transaction to Realogy Franchise Group; however such amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Realogy Brokerage Group paid marketing fees and royalties to Realogy Franchise Group of $316 million and $293 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The remainder of gross commission income is split between the broker (Realogy Brokerage Group) and the independent sales agent in accordance with their applicable independent contractor agreement (which specifies the portion of the broker commission to be paid to the agent), which varies by agent.
In addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services offered through our other segments, including title, escrow and settlement, mortgage origination and relocation services. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.
When we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally provide the seller with a full-service marketing program, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction. In addition, Realogy Brokerage Group has relationships with developers, primarily in major cities, to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments.
Realogy Brokerage Group is a broker within the Realogy Advantage Broker Network.
Realogy Title Group 
Overview 
Realogy Title Group consists of three primary businesses: our title agency business (also referred to as title, escrow and settlement services), our title underwriting business and the Company's share of equity earnings and losses from our Guaranteed Rate Affinity mortgage origination joint venture, of which we own a 49.9% and which is managed by our joint venture partner. 
Our title agency business provides title search, examination, clearance and policy issuance services and oversees the closing process and funds disbursement for real estate agents, attorneys and homebuilders on purchase transactions and lenders on refinance transactions. 
We also serve as an underwriter of title insurance policies in connection with residential and commercial real estate transactions under our title insurance business, insuring clear title and ownership for the lender and buyer in homesale transactions. Our clients include unaffiliated title agencies as well as title agencies that are a part of Realogy Title Group. 
We intend to grow our title, escrow and settlement services business by attracting title and escrow sales personnel in existing markets. We will also continue to seek to increase our capture rate of title business from Realogy Brokerage Group homesale sides. In addition, we expect to continue to grow our underwriting business by increasing our agent base. 
Operations
Title Agency, or Title, Escrow and Settlement Services. We are licensed as a title agent in 43 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 22 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 391 offices, approximately 181 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices. In addition to our own title, escrow and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution clients on a national basis.
Our title, escrow and settlement services business provides full-service title, escrow and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to consumers, real estate companies, corporations and financial institutions with many of these services provided in connection with the Company's real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses. We provide closing and escrow services relating to the closing of home purchases and refinancing of home loans. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from financial institutions throughout the mortgage lending industry. 
Our company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title, escrow and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Many of our offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. In 2020, our title, escrow and settlement business was involved in approximately 214,000 transactions of which approximately 56,000 related to Realogy Brokerage Group. The capture rate of our title, escrow and settlement services business from buyers or sellers represented by our company owned brokerages was approximately 34% in 2020. Other sources of our title, escrow and settlement services homesale business include Realogy Franchise Group, Realogy Leads Group and unaffiliated brokerage operations.
We provide our title, escrow and settlement services through a national network of escrow and closing agents (some of whom are our employees, while others are attorneys in private practice and independent title companies) to provide full-service title, escrow and settlement services to a broad-based group that includes lenders, home buyers and sellers, developers and independent real estate sales agents. Our role is generally that of an intermediary managing the completion of all the necessary documentation and services required to complete a real estate transaction.
Virtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the standard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search and examination function is performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium "split" is determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter, or is promulgated by state law. We derive revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold.
We have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, including our own underwriter (Title Resources Guaranty Company), which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. 
For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses.
Our title, escrow and settlement services business measures operating performance based on purchase and refinance closing units and the related title premiums and escrow fees earned on such closings. 
Title Underwriting. Title Resources Guaranty Company ("Title Resources") is a title insurance underwriter licensed in 37 states and Washington, D.C. We work with both unaffiliated and affiliated title agencies to provide title underwriting services relating to the closing of home purchases and refinancing of home loans, with the premiums we receive for such services derived approximately equally between affiliated and unaffiliated title agencies in the year-ended December 31, 2020. Our title underwriting business measures operating performance based on net title premiums earned for title policies issued by our underwriting operation.
Other Revenue. Other revenue generated by our title agency and title underwriting businesses includes closing protection letters, title searches, survey business, tax search, wire fees, and other fees ancillary to their services.
Mortgage Origination Joint Venture. Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our non-exclusive mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate, Inc. ("Guaranteed Rate") began doing business in August 2017. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates mortgage loans, including both purchase and refinancing transactions, to be sold in the market to mortgage companies and the governmental-sponsored enterprises. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates and markets its mortgage lending services to real estate agents across the country (including to independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned and franchised brokerages) and relocation companies (including our relocation operations) as well as a broad consumer audience. Our equity earnings or losses related to Guaranteed Rate Affinity are included in the financial results of Realogy Title Group, but are not reported as revenue to Realogy Title Group.
Many of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. Our company owned brokerage operations represented a majority of purchase transactions and approximately one-third of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s mortgage origination business for the year-ended December 31, 2020—with the joint venture benefiting in both purchase and refinancing transactions from the low interest rate environment. 
Under the Operating Agreement (the "GRA Agreement") between a subsidiary of Realogy Title Group and a subsidiary of Guaranteed Rate (the "GRA Member"), we own 49.9% of the home mortgage joint venture and Guaranteed Rate indirectly owns the remaining 50.1%. Under the GRA Agreement, Guaranteed Rate Affinity is to distribute to each of the Company and Guaranteed Rate the distributable net income based on each member's ownership interest percentage following the close of each quarter. We have certain governance rights related to the joint venture (including two of five board seats), but do not have control of the day-to-day operations of the joint venture. Rather, our joint venture partner, GRA Member, is the managing partner of the venture and makes decisions with respect to the day-to-day operation of the venture. Guaranteed Rate Affinity is licensed to conduct mortgage operations in all 50 states.
The GRA Agreement is for an initial 10-year term (ending August 2027) and automatically renews for additional 5 year terms, unless either party provides advance notice to terminate, provided that if certain performance metrics are achieved after the fifth year of the agreement, the first 5-year extension is not subject to termination upon advance notice. Either party can terminate the GRA Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, a change in control of the other member, subject to certain exceptions, or upon material breach by the other member not remediated within the cure period. We have certain additional performance-based termination rights.
The GRA Agreement does not prohibit Guaranteed Rate from operating its separate mortgage origination business in locations where Guaranteed Rate Affinity and its subsidiaries will have offices and does not limit the Company, Guaranteed Rate, or either of their subsidiaries from operating non-mortgage origination lines of business in locations where Guaranteed Rate Affinity operates. In addition, the Company is permitted to have ventures with other mortgage loan originators, but Guaranteed Rate has a 30-day right-of-first-refusal to acquire any mortgage origination business that we intend to acquire.
Products, Technology and Marketing 
Our ability to provide independent sales agents at company owned and franchised brokerages with compelling data and technology-powered products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable is core to our integrated business strategy.
The marketing and technology services and support provided by independent sales agents to their customers are an important element of the value offered by an agent in the home purchase and sale process. Our commitment to continuously develop and improve our marketing and technology-powered products and service is part of our value proposition to company owned and franchised real estate brokerages, affiliated independent sales agents and their customers as well as to our other businesses. Increasingly, these products and services are desired as an integrated set of tools, rather than stand-alone products and services.
Products and Technology
Since 2019, we have been developing our product and marketing strategies against the backbone of an open ecosystem architecture approach, which is designed to support the continuous creation and delivery of both our proprietary tools and third-party products to our agents in order to deliver a more comprehensive platform experience. Through this strategy, we are able to selectively enable qualified third-party vendors and products to access and interface with our products and services so that affiliated independent sales agents will be able to build their own configurable technology platform to drive their performance and productivity.
We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop marketing, technology and service offerings to meet the needs of affiliated independent sales agents. Examples of our technology-driven products designed to improve independent sales agent productivity and enhance the customer experience for home buyers and sellers include: 
•Social Ad Engine helps affiliated agents create an effective Facebook and Instagram ad in under three minutes via a marketing product launched in partnership with Facebook.
•Listing Concierge, a property marketing product, allows agents affiliated with Coldwell Banker company owned brokerages and certain franchisees to access a simple-to-use platform that delivers creative, consistent property marketing.
•Design Concierge, an agent branding and custom design product, allows agents affiliated with Coldwell Banker company owned brokerages and certain franchisees to work with the Design Concierge team to create their own complementary personal brand.
•RealVitalize enables home sellers to make their property ready for sale by providing resources to fund staging and home improvements with no up-front cost via a consumer program from Coldwell Banker’s company owned operations and HomeAdvisor. RealVitalize is available in 29 U.S. states as of December 31, 2020.
•RealSure offers sellers with qualifying properties the opportunity to receive a cash offer valid for 45 days immediately upon listing while also pursuing a better price by marketing their property with an affiliated independent sales agent during this timeframe. Sellers who are enrolled in RealSure Sell can utilize RealSure Buy to make a more competitive offer on their next home before their current home is sold by leveraging their RealSure Sell cash offer. These programs, created in partnership with Home Partners of America, are available in 11 U.S. markets as of December 31, 2020.
Our Realogy-provided platform is designed to increase the value proposition to our independent sales agents, franchisees (and their independent sales agents) and consumers by:
•aiding in lead generation and obtaining additional homesale transactions;
•connecting affiliated agents and brokers to a CRM tool that allows for the cultivation of productive relationships with consumers at all stages of the transaction;
•enhancing access to listing distributions through mobile applications and websites; 
•informing affiliated agents of valuable client insight to help those agents increase their productivity;
•providing consumers with a streamlined yet comprehensive user experience to facilitate the necessary steps for researching homes, communities and independent sales agents;
•providing key back office processes, including listing and transaction management, reporting, marketing, and agent profiles; and
•delivering business planning tools that enable our franchisees to track their progress against key business objectives in real time.
We are developing our next generation customer relationship management (CRM) tool and agent-facing listing websites in partnership with third-parties, among other tools. 
The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for, and adoption of, digital and virtual products and services that facilitate a remote home buying and selling experience. Our brands and businesses have access to a range of tools to assist consumers with virtual staging, virtual open houses, and remote online notarization for title, escrow and settlement closings.
Marketing
Each of our brands manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools and sales information and data that can be accessed through freestanding brand intranet sites to assist independent sales agents in becoming the best marketer of their listings. Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive leads to affiliated agents, increase brand awareness and perception, promote our network and offerings to the real estate industry and engage our customer base.
Each of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded principally by our franchisees (including company owned offices), although we may make discretionary contributions to any of the marketing funds and in certain instances are required to make contributions to certain marketing funds. 
Likewise, our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales agents and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales agents.
Our marketing programs and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to affiliated independent sales agents by:
•showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales agents who are the listing agents of these properties;
•building and maintaining brand awareness and preference for the brand; and
•increasing the local recognition of affiliated agents and brokerages.
Marketing programs are executed using a variety of media including, but not limited to social media, advertising, direct marketing and internet advertising. We also offer the independent sales agents broad-based advertising, mailings and other campaigns to generate leads, interest and recognition.
Websites
The Internet is the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We transmit listings to various platforms and services, place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites, and operate a variety of our own websites. We place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers.
Our brand websites contain listing information on a regional and national market basis, independent sales agent information, community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information and unique property and neighborhood insights from local agents. Additionally, each brand website allows independent sales agents to market themselves to consumers. 
Education
Each real estate brand provides learning and development materials and access to continuing education to its franchisees to assist them in building their real estate sales businesses. Each brand's engagement program contains different materials and delivery methods. The marketing materials include a detailed description of the services offered by our franchise systems (which will be available to the independent sales agent). Engagement modules may be delivered at conventions and orientation seminars, including virtual conventions and seminars, or through virtual classrooms. Most of the programs and materials made available in electronic form to franchisees over the respective system's private intranet site. Many of the materials are customizable to allow franchisees to achieve a personalized look and feel and make modifications to certain content as appropriate for their business and marketplace.
Human Capital Resources
Employees. Our employees are critical to the success of our business strategy. Our team includes a broad range of professionals, given the breadth of services offered by our three business segments and Corporate. The wide array of skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefits our operations and performance.
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,235 full-time employees and 200 part-time employees. At December 31, 2020, approximately 625 of our employees were located outside of the U.S., almost all of whom were employed by Cartus Relocation Services (a part of Realogy Franchise Group).
None of our employees are represented by a union, although outside of the U.S., we have employees in certain countries that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as an employee association.
Engagement. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we annually survey employees with the assistance of third-party consultants and implement actions to address areas of employee feedback. In 2020, we achieved a 90% engagement score and an 85% response rate.
Training. All employees are required to participate in annual training programs related to the Company’s Code of Ethics as well as Global Information Security and Information Management, given the critical nature of these topics to our business. 100% of active employees in each of the past three years have completed this training.  During 2020, we also developed a mandatory training module focused on the U.S. Fair Housing Act for our employees and worked with a third-party provider to begin delivering unconscious bias training to our people managers. The U.S. Fair Housing Act online module, as well as in-person training sessions related to local fair housing laws, were also made available to independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned and franchise brokerages. We also deliver additional mandatory training (such as sexual harassment training) based upon the employee position or local requirements. RealU, our learning and development platform, offers employees additional resources to continue to grow professionally, including access to on-demand training through LinkedIn learning and tools for career management.
Health & Safety. The protection of the health and safety of our employees is a Company priority. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis we have worked to comply with state and local regulators to ensure safe working conditions for our employees. At December 31, 2020, approximately 20% of our employees worked remotely on a full-time basis, other employees, in particular consumer-facing employees at our company owned brokerages, were operating in an office-based environment, while other employees remained on a hybrid model. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 crisis and are prepared to pivot as needed for the health and safety of our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion. Since our inception, Realogy has had a focus on diversity to improve representation and foster inclusion through employee and business resource groups across the enterprise. Employee Resources Groups (“ERGs”) promote an inclusive culture throughout the organization. At December 31, 2020, we had eight active ERGs—Asian and Pacific Islander Alliance, ACE (African-American and Caribbean), ONEVOZ (Hispanic & Latino), NextGen, REALDisabilities, RealPride, SERVICE (Veterans) and Women's—throughout the Company. Increasing diversity in executive and key leadership roles is a priority for the Company.
Independent Sales Agents.  As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, the successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams are critical to the business and financial results of our company owned brokerage operations. Additional information about the base of independent sales agents affiliated with company owned brokerages as well as franchisees is located in this Item 1. under "Realogy Franchise Group—Overview."
Seasonality
The residential housing market is seasonal, with a higher level of homesale transactions typically occurring in the second and third quarter of each year. As a result, historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year.
Competition
Real Estate Brokerage Industry. The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the recruitment, retention and performance of independent sales agents, the economic relationship between the broker and the agent (including the share of commission income retained by the agent and fees charged to or paid by the agent for services provided by the broker), the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales agents, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors, including macro-economic factors such as national, regional and local economic conditions.
We and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business as well as for independent sales agents with national and regional independent real estate brokerages and franchisors, discount and limited service brokerages, and with franchisees of our brands. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, HomeServices of America (a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate), Howard Hanna Holdings, EXP Realty, Compass, Redfin Corporation and Weichert, Realtors and several large franchisors: RE/MAX International, Inc., Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and HSF Affiliates LLC (operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Real Living Real Estate). We and affiliated franchisees also compete with leading listing aggregators, such as Zillow, Inc. and Realtor.com® (a listing aggregator held by News Corporation).
Competition for Independent Sales Agents. The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams is critical to the business and financial results of traditional brokerages—whether or not they are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition for independent sales agents in our industry is high and aggressive competition for the affiliation of independent sales agents has negatively impacted recruitment and retention efforts at both Realogy Franchise and Brokerage Groups, in particular with respect to more productive sales agents and in the densely populated metropolitan areas in which we operate, and has previously driven and may continue to drive losses in our market share. This competitive environment has continued throughout most of the COVID-19 crisis, particularly at the outset of the pandemic, when we took proactive measures to preserve liquidity, including in connection with our recruitment and retention efforts.
Most of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of its independent sales agents, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated leads. The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents are influenced by many factors, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales agents), other expenses borne by independent sales agents, leads or business opportunities generated for independent sales agents from the brokerage, independent sales agents' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, technology and data offerings as well as marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage or franchisor, the quality of the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales agents with whom they collaborate daily, as well as continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage or franchisor. 
We believe that a variety of factors in recent years have negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents in the industry generally and have increasingly impacted our recruitment and retention of top producing agents and put upward pressure on the average share of commissions earned by affiliated independent sales agents. Such factors include increasing competition, increasing levels of commissions paid to agents (including up-front payments and equity), changes in the spending patterns of independent sales agents (as more agents purchase services from third parties outside of their affiliated broker), a heightening focus on leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales agent from the brokerage, differentiation in the bundling of agent services or industry offerings (including non-traditional offerings), and the growth in independent sales agent teams. The recruitment and retention of independent sales agents has been and may continue to be further complicated by competitive models that do not prioritize traditional business objectives. For example, we believe that certain owned-brokerage competitors have investors that have historically allowed the pursuit of increases in market share over profitability, which not only exacerbates competition for independent sales agents, but places additional pressure on the share of commission income received by the agent, creating challenges to our and our franchisee’s margins and profitability. Whether this pattern and the extent to which it will continue is not yet certain.
Competition for productive agents has had and may again have a negative impact on our market share and may continue to put upward pressure on the average share of commissions earned by independent sales agents. These competitive market factors also impact our franchisees and such franchisees have and may continue to seek reduced royalty fee arrangements or other incentives from us to offset the continued business pressures on such franchisees, which could result in a reduction in royalty fees paid to us or other associated costs.
Commission Plan Competition Among Real Estate Brokerages.  Some of the firms competing for sales agents use different commission plans, which may be appealing to certain sales agents. There are several different commission plan variations that have been historically utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales agents. One of the most common variations has been the traditional graduated commission model where the independent sales agent receives a percentage of the brokerage commission that increases as the independent sales agent increases his or her volume of homesale transactions, and the brokerage frequently provides independent sales agents with a broad set of support offerings and promotion of properties. Other common plans include a desk rental (sometimes referred to as a 100% commission plan), a fixed transaction fee commission plan, and a capped commission plan. A capped commission plan generally blends aspects of the traditional graduated commission model with the 100% commission plan. Although less common, some real estate brokerages employ their sales agents and in such instances, employee agents may earn smaller brokerage commissions in exchange for other employee benefits or bonuses. Most brokerages focus primarily on one type of commission plan, though some may offer one or more of commission plan variations to their sales agents.
In many of their markets, Realogy Brokerage Group offers affiliated independent sales agents and sales agent teams a choice between a traditional graduated commission model or a two-tiered commission model, both of which emphasize our value proposition. The traditional graduated commission model has experienced declines in market share over the past several years. Increasingly, independent sales agents have affiliated with brokerages that offer a different mix of services to the agent, allowing the independent sales agent to select the services that they believe allow them to retain a greater percentage of the commission and purchase services from other vendors as needed. 
Low Barriers to Entry and Influx of Traditional and Non-Traditional Competition as well as Industry Disrupters. The real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants, including participants utilizing historical real estate brokerage models and those pursuing alternative variations of those models (including virtual brokerages and brokerages that operate in a more virtual fashion) as well as non-traditional methods of marketing real estate. The significant size of the U.S. real estate market, in particular the addressable market of commission revenues, has continued to attract outside capital investment in traditional and disruptive competitors that seek to access a portion of this market.
There are also market participants who differentiate themselves by offering consumers flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions (often coupled with fewer services). Although such competitors have yet to have a material impact on overall brokerage commission rates, this could change in the future if they use greater discounts as a means to increase their market share or improve their value proposition.
While real estate brokers using historical real estate brokerage models typically compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, brokerage commission, reputation, utilization of technology and personal contacts, participants pursuing non-traditional methods of marketing real estate may compete in other ways, including companies that employ technologies intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models or minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process and/or shift the nature of the residential real estate transaction from the historic consumer-to-consumer model to a corporate-to-consumer model. 
A growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions. For example, if iBuying models (including Opendoor and Zillow Offers) gain market share in the residential real estate industry, it could disintermediate real estate brokers and independent sales agents from buyers and sellers of homes either entirely or by reducing brokerage commissions that may be earned on those transactions. RealSure, the Company's collaboration with Home Partners of America, improves upon the iBuying model with a 45-day cash offer for consumers that also keeps the independent sales agent at the center of the transaction; however, there can be no assurance that this program will be successful or that it will operate as intended.
In addition, the concentration and market power of the top listing aggregators allow them to monetize their platforms by a variety of actions including, but not limited to, setting up competing brokerages and/or expanding their offerings to include products (such as agent tools) and services ancillary to the real estate transaction, such as title, escrow and mortgage origination services, that compete with services offered by us, charging significant referral, listing and display fees, diluting the relationship between agents and brokers and between agents and the consumer, tying referrals to use of their products, 
consolidating and leveraging data, and engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants. Actions by such listing aggregators have and may continue to put pressure on our and other industry participant's revenues and profitability. Aggregators could intensify their current business tactics or introduce new programs that could be materially disadvantageous to our business and other brokerage participants in the industry and such tactics could further increase pressures on the profitability of our company owned and franchised brokerages and affiliated independent sales agents, reduce our franchisor service revenue and dilute our relationships with our franchisees and our and our franchisees' relationships with affiliated independent sales agents and buyers and sellers of homes. For example, one dominant listing aggregator recently launched a brokerage with employee sales agents in several locations to support its iBuying offering and has joined many local multiple listing services, known as MLSs, as a participating broker to gain electronic access directly to real estate listings rather than relying on disparate electronic feeds from other brokers participating in the MLSs or MLS syndication feeds.
Franchise Competition. According to NAR, approximately 43% of individual brokers and independent sales agents are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and improve the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales agents. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, the availability of financing provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways and can include volume and other incentives, flat royalty and marketing fees, capped royalty fees, and discounted royalty and marketing fees. The capped royalty fee model has become increasingly popular with brokerages as independent sales agents are also increasingly seeking to affiliate with brokerages that offer the agent a capped fee commission income model. We launched a capped fee model at one of our brands in 2019 as substantially all of our other franchises are structured using a flat percentage (subject to volume-based incentives) model and we have faced increasing competition from franchisors utilizing alternative models. Taking into account competitive factors, we may, from time to time, restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands.
Upon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to franchise with one of our competitors or operate as an independent broker. Competitors may offer franchisees whose franchise agreements are expiring or prospective franchisees products and services similar to ours at rates that are lower than we charge. We also face the risk that currently unaffiliated brokers may not enter into franchise agreements with us because they believe they can compete effectively in the market without the need to license a brand of a franchisor and receive services offered by a franchisor or because they may believe that their business will be more attractive to a prospective purchaser without the existence of a franchise relationship. Regional and local franchisors as well as franchisors offering different franchise models or services provide additional competitive pressure. To effectively compete with competitor franchisors and to recruit new franchisees, we may have to take actions that would result in increased costs to us (such as increased sales incentives to franchisees) or decreased royalty payments to us (such as a reduction in or cap on the fees we charge our franchisees, including lower royalty rates), which may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and growth opportunities. In addition, our continued implementation of strategic initiatives intended to add new franchisees and grow our agent base through the introduction of new franchisee fee models and brands, while intended to capture additional market share with brokers unaffiliated with our brands, could result in greater intra-brand competition among our brands.
Leads Generation Business. The ability of a brokerage, whether company owned or franchised, to provide its independent sales agents with high-quality leads is increasingly important to the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and sale agent teams and the attraction and retention of franchisees. Numerous companies that market and sell residential real estate leads to independent sales agents, including listing aggregators, compete with our real estate benefit programs and other lead generation programs.
Relocation Operations. Competition in our corporate relocation operations is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global outsourced and regional relocation services providers in the corporate relocation operations. The larger outsourced relocation services providers that we compete with include SIRVA, Inc., BGRS, Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc. and Crown Relocations. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as an increasingly higher percentage of relocation clients reduce their global relocation benefits and related spend.
Title Agency and Title Underwriting Businesses. The title, escrow and settlement services and title underwriting businesses are highly competitive and fragmented. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. In certain parts of the country our title agency business competes with small title agents and attorneys while in other parts of the country our competition is the larger title underwriters and national vendor management 
companies. In addition, our title underwriter competes with other underwriters, including the various brands of national competitors including Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, First American Title Insurance Company, Stewart Title Guaranty Company and Old Republic Title Company.
For additional information on the competitive risks facing our businesses, see "Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Strategic & Operational Risks—The businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive, which has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our market share and put upward pressure on the average share of commissions earned by independent sales agents, which has and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance."
Government and Other Regulations 
RESPA.  RESPA, state real estate brokerage laws and similar laws in countries in which we do business restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, settlement services, lead generation, and relocation operations or the business of our mortgage origination joint venture. In addition, with respect to our company owned real estate brokerage, lead generation, relocation and title, escrow and settlement and title underwriting services businesses as well as our mortgage origination joint venture, RESPA and similar state laws generally require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) administers RESPA. Some state authorities have also asserted enforcement rights.
RESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between title underwriters and agents, real estate brokers and agents and market-based fees for the provision of goods or services and marketing arrangements.  In addition, RESPA allows for referrals to affiliated entities, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met.  We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA.  However, RESPA compliance may become a greater challenge under certain administrations, including the current administration, for most industry participants offering settlement services, including mortgage companies, title companies and brokerages, because of expansive interpretations of RESPA or similar state statutes by certain courts and regulators. Permissible activities under state statutes similar to RESPA may be interpreted more narrowly and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities may also be aggressively pursued. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes. Some regulators and other parties have advanced novel and stringent interpretations of RESPA including assertions that any provision of a thing of value in a separate, but contemporaneous transaction with a referral constitutes a breach of RESPA on the basis that all things of value exchanged should be deemed in exchange for the referral. Violations of RESPA or similar state statutes can lead to claims of substantial damages, which may include (but are not limited to) fines, treble damages and attorneys' fees.
We are also subject to state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers, which impacts our lead generation business.
Franchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by federal law under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, multiple states and U.S. territories have "franchise relationship laws" or "business opportunity laws" that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements (including mandated notice or cure periods), to discriminate unfairly among franchisees, or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the franchisors. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.
State Brokerage Laws.  Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales agents, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales agents, fiduciary, and agency and statutory duties, consumer disclosure obligations, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses.
Worker Classification. Although the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout most of the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations in our and other industries, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations and our affiliated franchisees. 
Real estate laws generally permit brokers to engage sales agents as independent contractors. Federal and state agencies have their own rules and tests for classification of independent contractors as well as to determine whether employees meet exemptions from minimum wages and overtime laws.  These tests consider many factors that also vary from state to state.  The tests continue to evolve based on state case law decisions, regulations and legislative changes.  
Changes in existing legislation, regulations or interpretations that are applicable to the residential real estate service industry may impact the Company. Certain jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting standards that are significantly more restrictive than those historically used in wage and hour cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There is active worker classification litigation in New Jersey against a competing residential real estate brokerage where the plaintiff seeks to reclassify independent sales agents as employees, from which the Company could be impacted if there is an adverse ruling. There have also been several challenges to the constitutionality and enforceability of a 2019 worker classification statute adopted in California (where Realogy Brokerage Group generated approximately 24% of its revenue in 2020) as it applies to other industries, which could potentially result in the statute being found unconstitutional and of no force — which could have the effect of eliminating that statute's less restrictive test applicable to real estate professionals in that state.
Similar to California, a number of other states have separate statutory structures and existing case law that articulate different, less stringent standards for real estate agents operating as independent contractors. How these differing tests will be reconciled is presently unclear, and given the evolving nature of this issue, we are currently unable to estimate what impact, if any, this would have on our operations or financial results.
Multiple Listing Services Rules.  We are a member of many multiple listing services ("MLSs"), a member-owner of certain MLSs, and a member of the National Association of REALTORS® ("NAR") and respective state realtor associations and, accordingly, are subject to each group's rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service, which specify, among other things, how we may access and use MLS data and listings and how MLS data and listings must be displayed on our and our franchisees' websites and mobile applications. The rules of each MLS to which we belong can vary widely and are complex.
From time to time, certain industry practices, including NAR and MLS rules, have come under regulatory scrutiny. For example, in June 2018, the DOJ and FTC held a joint public workshop to explore competition issues in the residential real estate brokerage industry since the publication of the FTC and DOJ’s 2007 Report on Competition in the Real Estate Brokerage Industry. Subsequently, in November 2020, the Department of Justice ("DOJ") filed a civil lawsuit against NAR alleging that NAR established and enforced illegal restraints on the ways agents compete. Pursuant to a simultaneously filed proposed settlement, NAR agreed to repeal and modify its rules (which are generally used by member MLSs to implement their rules) to provide greater transparency to home buyers about the commissions of brokers representing home buyers (buyer brokers), eliminate rules that prohibit filtering MLS listings based on the level of buyer broker commissions, and change its rules and policy which limit access to lockboxes to only NAR-affiliated real estate brokers. In addition, buyer brokers cannot represent their services as free to clients to the extent such representations were being made. In entering this agreement with the DOJ, NAR admitted no liability, wrongdoing or truth of any allegations by the DOJ.
A variety of additional issues, beyond those alleged in the DOJ's civil lawsuit against NAR, were raised in the 2018 DOJ and FTC workshop that could be determined to be anti-competitive in the future, including whether average broker commission rates were too high, whether industry platforms should have free access to listings and concerns around dual agency. There can be no assurances as to whether the DOJ or FTC or their state counterparts will determine that any industry practices or developments have an anti-competitive effect on the industry. Any such determination by the DOJ, FTC, or their state counterparts could result in industry investigations, legislative or regulatory action or other actions, any of which could have the potential to disrupt our business.
For a summary of certain legal proceedings in which NAR, Realogy and other large real estate brokerage companies are named defendants see Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation—Real Estate Litigation", in this Annual Report.
Anti-Discrimination Laws. Our company owned and franchised brokerages, and agents affiliated with such brokerages, as well as our other businesses are subject to federal and state housing laws that generally make it illegal to discriminate against protected classes of individuals in housing or brokerage services. For example, the Fair Housing Act, its state and local law counterparts, and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, all prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, and, in some states or locales, financial capability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or military status.
Antitrust, Competition and Bribery Laws. Our business is subject to antitrust and competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Act and related federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the U.S. The penalties for violating antitrust and competition laws can be severe. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, dividing markets, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. Our company owned and franchised brokerages (and independent sales agents affiliated with such brokerages) are also required to comply with state and local laws related to dual agency (such as where the same brokerage represents both the buyer and seller of a home) and increased regulation of dual agency representation may restrict or reduce the ability of impacted brokerages to participate in certain real estate transactions.
Our international business activities, and in particular our relocation operations, must comply with applicable laws and regulations that impose sanctions on improper payments, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of other countries.
Regulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Nearly all states license and regulate title agencies/settlement service providers or certain employees and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States may periodically lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States may also require title agencies, escrow companies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations of Texas, the jurisdiction in which our title insurance underwriter subsidiary, Title Resources, is domiciled, generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a Texas domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided required information to, and the acquisition is approved or not disapproved by, the Texas Department of Insurance. Generally, any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities would be presumed to have acquired indirect control of our title insurance underwriter subsidiary unless the Texas Department of Insurance, upon application, determines otherwise. Our insurance underwriter is also subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates, among other matters, investment policies and the ability to pay dividends. Our insurance underwriter must also defer a portion of premiums as an unearned premium reserve for the protection of policyholders (in addition to their reserves for known claims) and must maintain qualified assets based on statutory requirements.
Certain states in which we operate have "controlled business" statutes which impose limitations on affiliations between providers of title, escrow and settlement services on the one hand, and real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers on the other hand. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. "Controlled business" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, or are under common control with, the title agent. Pursuant to regulations in New York, title agents with affiliated businesses must make a good faith effort to obtain and be open for title insurance business from all sources and not business only from affiliated persons, including actively competing in the marketplace. A company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the payment of fines and penalties or the non-renewal of the Company's license to provide title, escrow and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable "controlled business" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control.
Regulation of the Mortgage Industry. We participate in the mortgage origination business through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity. Private mortgage lenders operating in the U.S. are subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation and to significant oversight by government sponsored entities. Dodd-Frank endows the CFPB with rule making, examination and enforcement authority involving consumer financial products and services, including mortgage finance.  The CFPB has issued a myriad of rules, including TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rules, which impose significant obligations on Guaranteed Rate Affinity.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations.  To run our business, it is essential for us to store and transmit sensitive personal information about our customers, prospects, employees, independent agents, and relocation transferees in our systems and networks. At the same time, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements, domestically and globally, that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, sale, or transfer of personal data. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs. For example, in the U.S., we are required to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information, as well as state statutes governing privacy and cybersecurity matters like the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") Cybersecurity Regulation.
The CCPA imposes new and comprehensive requirements on organizations that collect, sell and disclose personal information about California residents and employees. In November 2020, California passed Proposition 24, establishing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will take effect January 1, 2023. The CPRA provides further requirements that will impact our businesses’ compliance efforts and operational risks as the CPRA differentiates “personal information” and “sensitive information,” expands the term “sale” to include sharing of personal information, and imposes data minimization and data retention requirements. The CPRA also established a new California Privacy Protection Agency, which is intended to take a more active role in enforcement of the law. Other states are likely to follow California’s lead and implement their own privacy statutes in the near term.
Under the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation, regulated financial institutions, including Realogy Title Group, are required to establish a detailed cybersecurity program. Other state regulatory agencies have or are expected to enact similar requirements following the adoption of the Insurance Data Security Model Law by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is consistent with the New York regulation. 
Internationally, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") has conferred new and significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents) and materially increased penalties for violations. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, one of the methods for transfers of personal data into the U.S. As a result, companies may have to rely on standard contractual clauses, or binding corporate rules for the transfer of personal data while awaiting further guidance or regulation. Other countries have also recently expanded on data privacy laws and regulations. 
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) restricts certain types of telemarketing calls and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice messages. The TCPA also established a national Do-Not-Call registry. As the TCPA defines autodialing broadly and requires express written consent for certain communications to cellphones, our industry is vulnerable to claims made by class action consumers for contacts made by independent contractor real estate agents.
Finally, our security systems and IT infrastructure may not adequately protect against all potential security breaches, cyber-attacks, or other unauthorized access to personal information, including ransomware incidents. Third parties, including vendors or suppliers that provide essential services for our global operations, could also be a source of security risk to us if they experience a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. We, our third-party service providers, franchisees, franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents, and joint venture partners have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents.
Defending against cyberattacks has led and will likely continue to lead to increased costs to us with respect to preventing, investigating, mitigating, insuring against and remediating these risks, as well as any related attempted or actual fraud. Our corporate errors and omissions and cybersecurity breach insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any significant violations of privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could result in the loss of new or existing business, litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines, damages, and penalties and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
