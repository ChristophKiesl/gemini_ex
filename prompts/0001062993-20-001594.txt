ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Live Current Media, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 10, 1995.  The Company has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with 34,837,625 shares currently issued and outstanding.
 The Company is the sole shareholder of Domain Holdings Inc., originally formed under the laws of British Columbia, Canada on July 4, 1994 and re-domiciled to Alberta, Canada on April 14, 1999 ("DHI").  The Company is also the majority shareholder of Perfume, Inc. (95% ownership), formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 13, 2008.  Perfume, Inc. is currently dormant and does not carry on an active business.  References herein to the Company include DHI and Perfume, Inc. (collectively, the "Subsidiaries") unless otherwise stated.
 On March 21, 2019, the Company executed a distribution agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") with Cell MedX Corp. ("Cell MedX" or the "Device Manufacturer"), pursuant to which Cell MedX granted to the Company exclusive worldwide rights to distribute the eBalance microcurrent device to households and individual users.  Subsequent to the year ended 2019, the Company agreed to sell the distribution rights to the eBalance device back to Cell MedX Corp. pursuant to an agreement dated January 29, 2020. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company reorganized its business operations with the development and addition of two eSports and Gaming products, SPRT MTRX and Boxing.com FEDERATION.  eSports and Gaming will be the Company's focus moving forward.
 Domain Name and Website Development Business
 During the fiscal year 2019, DHI was in the business of utilizing its exclusive ownership of domain names to develop internet-related business ventures.  The Company, through DHI, holds title to a portfolio of approximately one hundred (100) intuitive, generic domains, such as Electronic.com, Boxing.com and Stereos.com, which inherently attract a stream of online visitors. The Company is now actively seeking to sell the domain names that do not fit into its eSports and Gaming venture and exit the domain name business.  Boxing.com is the only existing domain name that fits the description of an eSports and Gaming domain and is currently under development.
 Distribution of Cell MedX eBalance Devices
 On March 21, 2019, the Company executed the Distribution Agreement with Cell MedX, pursuant to which Cell MedX granted to the Company an exclusive worldwide license to distribute its eBalance microcurrent device to households and individual users.  To acquire these rights, the Company paid to Cell MedX the sum of $250,000, the full amount of which was paid to Cell MedX upon signing of the letter of intent between the Company and Cell MedX in September 2018.  Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to Cell MedX a fee (the "License Fee") for each eBalance device sold.  In addition, the users of the eBalance device were to be charged a periodic user fee (the "User Fee") that will be split between the Company and Cell MedX.  To maintain its exclusive distribution rights, the Company was subject to minimum sales and, after a period of time, minimum User Fee, requirements.  If the Company failed to meet the minimum sales requirements, the Company would have maintain its distribution rights, however those rights would cease to be exclusive.
 During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company made the decision to exit the medical device distribution business and agreed to sell the rights back to Cell MedX pursuant to an agreement dated January 29, 2020.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sold the Distribution Rights back to Cell MedX in consideration for a royalty on future sales of the eBalance device capped at US$507,500, plus warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares in the common stock of Cell MedX (the "Warrants") exercisable for a period of three (3) years.  1,000,000 of the Warrants are exercisable at a price of $US0.50 per share (the "$0.50 Warrants"), with the remaining 1,000,000 Warrants exercisable at US$1.00 per share (the "$1.00 Warrants").  The Warrants are subject to an acceleration right, with the $0.50 Warrants being subject to acceleration if Cell MedX's common stock trades at or above $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, and the $1.00 Warrants being subject to acceleration if Cell MedX's common stock trades at or above $1.75 per share for 30 consecutive trading days.  Cell MedX may buyout the royalty at any time during the first twelve months following the effective date of the agreement for 85% of the remaining amount of the royalty still payable.

eSports and Gaming
 Market.  70% of Americans play games online.  54% of those gamers are male, 46% are female and 52% are college educated.  60% play on their mobile devices.  Gamers play for mental stimulation, relaxation and stress relief, while prize money is a major inducement.
 In 2019, eSports prize money topped $1 billion for the first time, increasing 10-fold from prizes awarded in 2010, with expectations that prizes will keep accelerating to reach $1.8 billion by 2022 according to Statista.  Competitions can have prizes ranging far north of $1 million.
 In addition, gaming advertising revenue has doubled in the last two years.  The most common platform for playing games is the smartphone leaving no doubt as to why gaming is taking off.
 SPRT MTRX
 SPRT MTRX is a gaming app, available in both iPhone and Android versions, in which players bid on the final scores of NHL games.  The events are organized as "Challenges" and cover multiple games over one day.  A cash prize is awarded to the player who receives the most points for correctly bidding on the final scores of the hockey games included in the Challenge.  The system for bidding on the final scores is unique in the gaming industry. 
 Business Model.  The business model entails offering free prizes for playing the game, developing a large contingent of users and delivering advertisements.  This model has proven popular among gamers as the lure of free money is a very attractive inducement. 
 Development.  The Company will continue to develop and enhance the SPRT MTRX through 2020 by adding additional functionality and more sports such as NFL, MLB, NBA and EPL but does not anticipate generating any significant revenue from SPRT MTRX in fiscal 2020.
 Boxing.com FEDERATION
 Boxing.com FEDERATION is being developed to mimic what the sport of boxing should be.  But the fights will be fought by gamers on their computers.
 League.  FEDERATION will consist of an amateur league where fighters hone their skills and can win amateur belts with small cash prizes and a professional league where fighters win title belts and larger cash prizes.  The top amateurs will automatically join the professional league where fighters can win title belts in nine different weight classes and cash prizes for getting in to the top 10 fighters per weight class.  There will also be title belts for champions in each country in the world just as there is in real boxing.  These champions will also receive cash prizes for winning their belts.
 Ranking.  The ranking system will be organized by a digital algorithm to be designed by Live Current's engineers.  Fighters can challenge other fighters in the FEDERATION by choosing those within 100 of their own placing in the rankings.  Only fighters who are online can be challenged and they must accept the challenge or drop in the rankings to the spot of the challenger.  If they accept the challenge and lose, they only drop one place but get an L on their record.  Rankings will be automatically adjusted monthly to promote activity and discourage inactivity.
 Schedule.  FEDERATION is scheduled for release in 2021.  The Company does not anticipate generating revenue from FEDERATION in 2020.
 The Company does not believe it has the necessary cash requirements for the next 12 months without having to raise additional funds.
 ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS
 An investment in the Company's common shares involves a high degree of risk.

You should consider each of the following risk factors and the other information in this registration statement, including the Company's financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating its business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact on the Company's business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently consider immaterial may also impair its business operations.  If any of the following risks do occur, its business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of its common stock could decline.
 Risks Associated with the Company's eSports and Gaming Business
 Licensing.  Currently, other than business and operations licenses applicable to most commercial ventures, the Company is not required to obtain any governmental approval for its business operations.  There can be no assurance, however, that governmental institutions will not, in the future, impose licensing or other requirements on the Company.  Additionally, as noted below, there are a variety of laws and regulations that may, directly or indirectly, have an impact on the Company's business.
 Privacy Legislation and Regulations.  While the Company is not currently subject to licensing requirements, entities engaged in operations over the Internet, particularly relating to the collection of user information, are subject to limitations on their ability to utilize such information under federal and state legislation and regulation. In 2000, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act required that the collection of identifiable information regarding users of financial services be subject to stringent disclosure and "opt-out" provisions. While this law and the regulations enacted by the Federal Trade Commission and others relates primarily to information relating to financial transactions and financial institutions, the broad definitions of those terms may make the businesses entered into by the Company and its strategic partners subject to the provisions of the Act. This, in turn, may increase the cost of doing business and make it unattractive to collect and transfer information regarding users of services. This, in turn, may reduce the revenues of the Company and its strategic partners, thus reducing potential revenues and profitability. Similarly, the Children On-line Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA") imposes strict limitations on the ability of Internet ventures to collect information from minors. The impact of COPPA may be to increase the cost of doing business on the Internet and reducing potential revenue sources. The Company may also be impacted by the US Patriot Act, which requires certain companies to collect and provide information to United States governmental authorities. A number of state governments have also proposed or enacted privacy legislation that reflects or, in some cases, extends the limitations imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and COPPA. These laws may further impact the cost of doing business on the Internet and the attractiveness of Live Current's inventory of domain names.
 Advertising Regulations.  In response to concerns regarding "spam" (unsolicited electronic messages), "pop-up" web pages and other Internet advertising, the federal government and a number of states have adopted or proposed laws and regulations which would limit the use of unsolicited Internet advertisements. While a number of factors may prevent the effectiveness of such laws and regulations, the cumulative effect may be to limit the attractiveness of effecting and promoting sales on the Internet, thus reducing the value of the Company's advertising driven revenue model.
 There are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the Internet.  However, laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy, pricing and the characteristics and quality of products and services.  For example, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to prohibit transmitting various types of information and content over the Internet.  Several telecommunications companies have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to regulate Internet service providers and on-line service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on those companies.  This could increase the cost of transmitting data over the Internet.  Moreover, it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership, libel and personal privacy are applicable to the Internet.  Any new laws or regulations relating to the Internet or any new interpretations of existing laws could have a negative impact on Live Current's business and add additional costs to doing business on the Internet.
 Competition.  The Company competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than itself in the B2C (business-to-consumer) market as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. In addition, some of these competitors have been in business for longer than Live Current and may have established more strategic partnerships and relationships than the Company.
 Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers.  The Company does not currently depend on any single customer for a significant proportion of its business. However, as the Company enters into strategic transactions, the Company may choose to grant exclusive rights to a small number of parties or otherwise limit its activities that could, in turn, create such dependence. The Company, however, has no current plans to do so.

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights.  On November 16, 2007, The Company filed a trademark application with the US Patent & Trademark Office ("USPTO") for the mark "LIVE CURRENT".  A certificate of registration was issued on October 14, 2008 and the mark was assigned registration number 3,517,876.
 The Company will consider seeking further trademark protection for its online businesses, however, the Company may be unable to avail itself of trademark protection under United States laws. Consequently, the Company will seek trademark protection only where it has determined that the cost of obtaining protection, and the scope of protection provided, results in a meaningful benefit to the Company.
 Market Acceptance.  Both SPRT MTRX and FEDERATION are new products in a product abundant gaming market and there is no guarantee that they will be accepted by the market.  In addition to acceptance, should they be accepted, there is no guarantee that they will maintain their popularity in a notoriously fickle gaming market.
Risks Related to the Company's Securities
 The Company's stock price is volatile.  The stock markets in general, and the stock prices of internet companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company.  The market price of the Company's Common Stock is likely to fluctuate in the future, especially if the Company's Common Stock is thinly traded.  Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of the Company's Common Stock include:
 (a) actual or anticipated variations in the Company's results of operations;
 (b) the Company's ability or inability to generate new revenues;
 (c) increased competition;
 (d) government regulations, including internet regulations;
 (e) conditions and trends in the internet industry;
 (f) proprietary rights; or
 (g) rumors or allegations regarding the Company's financial disclosures or practices.
 The Company's stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to its operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company's Common Stock.
 The Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.  The Company has never paid cash dividends on its Common Stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.  The Company intends to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand its business.
 "Penny Stock" rules may make buying or selling the Company's Common Stock difficult, and severely limit its market and liquidity.  Trading in The Company's Common Stock is subject to certain regulations adopted by the SEC commonly known as the "penny stock" rules.  The Company's Common Stock qualifies as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell the Common Stock in the aftermarket.  The "penny stock" rules govern how broker-dealers can deal with their clients and "penny stocks".  For sales of The Company's Common Stock, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from you a written agreement prior to making a sale to you.  The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by the "penny stock" rules may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in The Company's Common Stock, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of its Common Stock.  This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the price of the Common Stock to decline.
 Lack of operating revenues.  The Company has limited operating revenues and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  Management has assessed the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and the financial statements included with this registration statement includes disclosure that there is a substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The audit report of the Company's principal independent accountants for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 includes a statement regarding the uncertainty of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company's failure to achieve profitability and positive operating revenues could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, and could cause the Company's business to fail.
 No assurance that forward-looking assessments will be realized.  The Company's ability to accomplish their objectives and whether or not they are financially successful is dependent upon numerous factors, each of which could have a material effect on the results obtained. Some of these factors are in the discretion and control of management and others are beyond management's control. The assumptions and hypotheses used in preparing any forward-looking assessments contained herein are considered reasonable by management. There can be no assurance, however, that any projections or assessments contained herein or otherwise made by management will be realized or achieved at any level.
