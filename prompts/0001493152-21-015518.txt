ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
12 ReTech Corporation is a holding company with subsidiaries that develop, sell, and install software that we believe enhance the shopping experience for shoppers and retailers. As a holding company we also acquire synergistic operating companies that manufacture and sell fashion and other products to other retailers as well as selling these products online. In October 2019, we acquired retail stores in airport terminals and casinos solidifying us as a true Omni-Channel retailer. Owning our own brick and mortar stores will allow us to deploy our cutting-edge software and Apps in the United States, to demonstrate its effectiveness at attracting shoppers and inducing them to purchase. In our own stores, we plan to test, in real time, new software products which should delight consumers and generate incremental revenues and profits for our stores. If we can show incremental revenues and profits for ourselves, we believe that other retailers may follow our example and deploy our software solutions themselves.
 
With the intended future launch of our social shopping app which is in development in 2021 (see subsequent events) we intend to associate with other retailers on a new shopping platform that will benefit both consumers and retailers in new and exciting ways.
 
During the 4th quarter 2019 and continuing in the first quarter 2020 amid the effects of the pandemic created by COVID-19, the Company chose to consolidate its operations around three operating entities; 12 Tech, Inc., formed in Arizona on December 26, 2019 (“12 Tech”) and 12 Retail Corporation, formed on September 17th, 2017 (“12 Retail”), and the 12 Fashion Group, Inc formed on June 26, 2020.
 
12 Retail operates its own retail outlet(s) as well as those of Bluwire Group, LLC (“Bluwire”) that operates retail stores in airports (mainly in international terminals) and casinos. Because of their locations mainly in international terminals of airports, all Bluwire Company owned stores and all but one royalty store remains closed due to Covid-19. 12 Retail will also serve to demonstrate the effectiveness of the software technology created by 12 Tech in improving revenues and profits for retailers as well as providing access to other retailers through our soon to be launched social shopping app and through our wholesale fashion business relationships.
 
12 Fashion Group, Inc., an Arizona Corporation, was formed on June 26, 2020, and operates our fashion wholesale and direct to consumer brands, including Rune NYC, Social Sunday, and Red Wire Design, as well as consolidating remaining operations from our other smaller fashion acquisitions.
 
Today, 12 Tech aims to provide technology solutions both online and inside retail brick and mortar that helps retailers acquire customers, reduce overhead expenses, streamline operations, and gain incremental revenues and profits. Existing 12 Tech solutions are deployed mainly in Asia. We are planning to deploy our solutions in the United States retail markets, which serve the world’s largest consumer economy. While we continue to operate in Asia, we have consolidated our international units, which were focused on our technology deployment (“12 Japan” and “12 Europe”), and consolidated our software development company 12 Hong Kong, Ltd (“12 HK”), under 12 Tech to further streamline our own operations.
 
As the retail environment continues to evolve, we as both retailers and technologists, will evolve with it. We believe our developed software, both current and in development, will delight consumers, provide contactless experiential shopping, and assist retailers with the recapture of their revenues as they combat the dual threats of Amazon and Walmart. Our software, once fully deployed and implemented, may provide retailers with another effective online and mobile sales channel besides their current options of Google, Amazon, and/or Facebook/Instagram.
 
As an innovative retail technology company that has been built through acquisitions and ideas, we will continue to search for additional synergistic acquisitions that bring incremental revenues and profitability and/or provide innovative software solutions.
 
The Opportunity:
 
Brick and mortar retailers continue to struggle against online competition and the largest big box retailers. This struggle was not made any easier with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We believe the enforced lock-down and social distancing restrictions will change consumer behaviors, maybe permanently, in ways that no one could have predicted in 2019.
 
Throughout history, great change also provides great opportunity. 12 ReTech believes that our software solutions for business will provide effective tools that businesses can and will use to entice consumers back to their businesses to purchase products and services in new ways. As restrictions become more and more a part of the new normal, consumers will be anxious to get out of their homes to enjoy life again. We believe that each business must provide information and resources to allow consumers to feel safe shopping in stores, dining in restaurants and traveling.

Management believes that consumers will want assurances that the business has taken steps to ensure their safety and protect them from COVID-19, the flu, and the next virus that may come along, but they will want to be engaged and find their shopping, dining, and travel to also be experiential, entertaining, fun, and safe.
 
Businesses will need to be able to contact and engage with consumers from a distance, whether at their homes, offices (to a lesser extent), online, and through mobile apps, as well as in their physical stores. We believe that our technology solutions allow consumers to get product or service information, share their choices with their social network, and purchase or reserve products and services in physical locations and online, so consumers can choose to be contactless.
 
World-wide retailing represents approximately $28 trillion in revenues, while in 2018 in the U.S. alone, all forms of retailing represented $5.35 trillion in annual revenues (according to Statista March 2019). While management believes that the Company’s software and technologies can benefit almost all retailers, the Company will initially focus on the Electronics, Apparel, and Cosmetics sectors where they believe we can have the biggest impact and which market generated over $346 billion in 2018 revenues in just the U.S. (Statista March 2019).
 
Management believes that the fallout from COVID-19 will provide a tremendous opportunity for those developers, like our Company, that quickly adapt their software and create new applications to provide solutions that consumers and business need. While businesses were reluctant to change before this pandemic, they are all now forced to look for new solutions, which we intend to provide. Many of our applications, with some additional development, as well as new software solutions, will quickly solve these problems. For example:
 
We were contactless before it was cool!™ In 2018, we launched our 12 Sconti App in Europe which, among other things, allowed the consumers to receive offers from participating nearby retailers that the consumer could purchase right from their smart phone, walk into the retailer and pick up their goods, just by showing their QR code. What we learned from this app is being applied to our new social shopping app, which is now in development.
 
Our Acquisition Strategy:
 
The Company targets for acquisition those synergistic companies that provide immediate revenue, and the potential for growth in revenue and earnings and/or may provide entries to license or sell our software and technology to other businesses and consumer brands, and/or will provide support services to our existing operations. Therefore, we target acquisitions that can benefit from our technology platform and expertise to grow their operations, brands that can give us entry into other businesses, and support companies for our brands and technologies.
 
We now target for acquisition those companies with at least $3 million in annual sales, that have existing management teams which complement our own. We will also acquire smaller companies that, when added to our own, allows us to leverage our existing operations without significantly increasing our costs. Other candidates would be companies with existing software for our technology subsidiary or companies where we can demonstrate the effectiveness of our technology. We are, of course, always looking to acquire larger companies or brands. We in fact have been and are still in talks with larger entities, but these are our minimum requirements.

Our Technology Rollout Strategy:
 
Our subsidiary 12 Tech has, through 12 Japan and 12 Hong Kong, already deployed and tested our existing USXS software applications at ITOYA LTD in Japan. Using the knowledge that we gained from that real-world experience and adapting it to the post COVID-19 reality, we have begun to demonstrate some of our solutions in the United States of America.
 
During 2021, as the U.S. beings to re-open, we plan to deploy our technology in our retail stores. By demonstrating the lift that our technology achieves, we will then use our relationships that have been developed from our fashion brands to approach other businesses with this information to license the software to them. However, until we launch our new social shopping app with features to allow users to interact with our screens, our existing technology will not be very effective as we believe that post Covid most consumers will be reluctant to touch a public touch screen.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to announce and launch our new consumer-based social shopping mobile App that any consumer-based business can subscribe to in order to reach and interact with consumers easily in fun and innovative ways, and especially contactless.
