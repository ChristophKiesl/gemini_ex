ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL
 We are a diversified media company, formed in 1980, principally focused on radio broadcasting. Emmis owns 4 FM and 2 AM radio stations in New York and Indianapolis. One of the FM radio stations that Emmis currently owns in New York is operated pursuant to a Local Marketing Agreement (“LMA”) whereby a third party provides the programming for the station and sells all advertising within that programming. In addition to our radio properties, we also publish Indianapolis Monthly and operate a dynamic pricing business (“Digonex”). In March 2020, we acquired the sound masking business of Lencore Acoustics Corporation for $75.1 million as part of our operating strategy to diversify into businesses that display better growth characteristics than the radio and magazine businesses that have historically comprised substantially all of our operating results.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 Delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq
 On April 21, 2020, our Board of Directors determined to voluntarily delist the Company’s Class A common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). On April 24, 2020, the Company notified Nasdaq of the Board’s determination, issued a press release, posted the press release on our website and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K. On May 4, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC a Form 25 requesting the delisting of its Class A common stock from Nasdaq and the deregistration of its common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The last day of trading in our Class A common stock was May 13, 2020. After delisting, the Company’s Class A common stock may be eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets Group if market makers commit to making a market in the Company’s shares. The Company can provide no assurance that trading in its Class A common stock will continue on the OTC Markets Group or otherwise.
 After the effectiveness of the Form 25, the Company intends to file with the SEC, on or about May 14, 2020, a Form 15 requesting the deregistration of its Class A common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and the suspension of the Company’s reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we expect that this will be our last Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 We are committed to improving the operating results of our core assets while simultaneously seeking future growth opportunities in new businesses. Our strategy is focused on the following operating principles:
 Develop unique and compelling content and strong local brands
 Most of our established local media brands have achieved and sustained a leading position in their respective market segments over many years. Knowledge of local markets and consistently producing unique and compelling content that meets the needs of our target audiences are critical to our success. As such, we make substantial investments in areas such as market research, data analysis and creative talent to ensure that our content remains relevant, has a meaningful impact on the communities we serve and reinforces the core brand image of each respective property.
 Extend the reach and relevance of our local brands through digital platforms
 In recent years, we have placed substantial emphasis on enhancing the distribution of our content through digital and mobile platforms. We believe these digital platforms offer excellent opportunities to further enhance the relationships we have with our audiences by allowing them to consume and share our content in new ways and providing us with new distribution channels for one-to-one communication with them.
 Deliver results to advertisers
 Competition for advertising revenue is intense and becoming more so. To remain competitive, we focus on sustaining and growing our audiences, optimizing our pricing strategy and developing innovative marketing programs for our clients that allow them to interact with our audiences in more direct and measurable ways. These programs often include elements such as on-air endorsements, events, contests, special promotions, Internet advertising, email marketing, interactive mobile advertising and online video. Our ability to deploy multi-touchpoint marketing programs allows us to deliver a stronger return-on-investment for our clients while simultaneously generating ancillary revenue streams for our media properties.
 Extend sales efforts into new market segments
 Given the competitive pressures in many of our “traditional” advertising categories, we have been expanding our network of advertiser relationships into not-for-profits, political advertising, corporate philanthropy, environmental initiatives and government agencies. These efforts primarily focus on the health care and education sectors. We believe our capabilities can address these clients’ under-served needs.
 Enhance the efficiency of our operations
 We believe it is essential that we operate our businesses as efficiently as possible. We regularly review our business operations and reduce costs or realign resources as necessary. We have also invested in common technology platforms across all of our radio stations to help further standardize our business processes.

Pursue new businesses that display better growth characteristics
 Advertising revenues in our radio and magazine businesses remain under heavy pressure by new forms of digital media. We have experienced steady declines in our advertising revenues, partially offset by the growth we have been able to generate from our events and digital initiatives. In recent years, we have been divesting radio stations and magazines to repay our indebtedness and reduce our exposure to these businesses. We intend to continue to explore diversification of our business and seek to acquire new businesses with proven business models and strong growth prospects where we can apply our marketing, management and restructuring expertise to accelerate growth.
 RADIO STATIONS
 In the following table, “Market Rank by Revenue” is the ranking of the market revenue size of the principal radio market served by our stations among all radio markets in the United States. Market revenue rankings are from BIA/Kelsey’s Media Access Pro database as of April 13, 2020. “Ranking in Primary Demographic Target” is the ranking of the station within its designated primary demographic target among all radio stations in its market based on the March 2020 Nielsen Audio, Inc. (“Nielsen”) Portable People Meter results. A “t” indicates the station tied with another station for the stated ranking. “Station Audience Share” represents a percentage generally computed by dividing the average number of persons in the primary demographic listening to a particular station during specified time periods by the average number of such persons in the primary demographic for all stations in the market area as determined by Nielsen.

STATION AND MARKET | MARKET RANK BY REVENUE | | FORMAT | | PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET AGES | | RANKING IN PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET | | STATION AUDIENCE SHARE
-------------------+------------------------+----+--------+-------------------------+---------------------------------+-------+---------------------------------------+-----+-----------------------
New York, NY1 | | 2 | | | | | | | |

1 | Our second owned station in New York, WEPN-FM, is being operated pursuant to an LMA. Under the terms of the LMA, New York AM Radio LLC, a subsidiary of Disney Enterprises, Inc., provides the programming for the station and sells all advertising within that programming. Emmis continues to own and operate WEPN-FM.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to our other radio broadcasting operations, we own and operate Network Indiana, a radio network that provides news and other programming to approximately 70 affiliated radio stations in Indiana.
 ADVERTISING SALES
 Our stations derive their advertising revenue from local and regional advertising in the marketplaces in which they operate, as well as from the sale of national advertising. Local and most regional sales are made by a station’s or magazine’s sales staff. National sales are made by firms specializing in such sales, which are compensated on a commission-only basis. We believe that the volume of national advertising revenue tends to adjust to shifts in a station’s audience share position more rapidly than does the volume of local and regional advertising revenue. During the year ended February 29, 2020, approximately 15% of our total advertising revenues were derived from national sales, and 85% were derived from local sales.
NEW TECHNOLOGIES
 We believe that the growth of new technologies not only presents challenges, but also opportunities for broadcasters and publishers. The primary challenge is increased competition for the time and attention of our listeners and readers. The primary opportunity is to further enhance the relationships we already have with our listeners and readers by expanding products and services offered by our radio stations and Indianapolis Monthly and to increase distribution to in-home devices like smart speakers as well as portable devices like smartphones and tablets.
 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
 We believe that to be successful, we must be integrally involved in the communities we serve. We see ourselves as community partners. To that end, each of our radio stations and Indianapolis Monthly participate in many community programs, fundraisers and activities that benefit a wide variety of causes. Charitable organizations that have been the beneficiaries of our contributions, marathons, walkathons, concerts, fairs and festivals include, among others, The Salvation Army, Wish for Heroes, Habitat for Humanity, United Way, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Make-A-Wish Foundation, March of Dimes, American Red Cross, St. Jude, and the Harlem Chamber of Commerce.
 The National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation (“NABEF”) has honored us with the Hubbard Award, honoring a broadcaster “for extraordinary involvement in serving the community.” Emmis was the second broadcaster to receive this prestigious honor, after the Hubbard family, for which the award is named. WIBC-FM was nominated for a national Crystal Award from the National Association of Broadcasters for our efforts in the community in 2014 and 2016. Also, our chief executive officer received the 2017 Michael A. Carroll award, a prestigious award given by the Indianapolis Business Journal to a person who has worked to improve the central Indiana community.

INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT
 We have an active leadership role in a wide range of industry organizations. Our senior managers have served in various capacities with industry associations, including as directors of the National Association of Broadcasters, the Radio Advertising Bureau, the Radio Futures Committee, the Nielsen Audio Advisory Council, the Media Financial Management Association, the City and Regional Magazine Association and as founding members of the Magazine Publishers of America. Our chief executive officer has been honored with the National Association of Broadcasters’ “National Radio Award,” was named Radio Ink’s “Radio Executive of the Year,” and was named the 2017 recipient of the Broadcasters Foundation of America’s “Lowry Mays Excellence in Broadcasting Award.” In 2018, our chief financial officer was awarded Media Financial Management’s “Rainmaker Award” recognizing his efforts and contributions in helping Media Financial Management’s growth initiatives. Our other management and on-air personalities have won numerous industry awards.
COMPETITION
 Radio broadcasting stations compete with the other broadcasting stations in their respective market areas, as well as with other advertising media such as newspapers, cable, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, the Internet, satellite radio, direct marketing and mobile and wireless device marketing. Competition within the broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual market areas, so that a station in one market (e.g., New York) does not generally compete with stations in other markets (e.g., Los Angeles). In each of our markets, our stations face competition from other stations with substantial financial resources, including stations targeting the same demographic groups. In addition to management experience, factors that are material to competitive position include the station’s rank in its market in terms of the number of listeners, authorized power, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other stations in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position with programming and promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our stations. We also seek to improve our position through sales efforts designed to attract advertisers that have done little or no radio advertising by emphasizing the effectiveness of radio advertising in increasing the advertisers’ revenues. The policies and rules of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) permit certain joint ownership and joint operation of local stations. Most of our radio stations take advantage of these joint arrangements in an effort to lower operating costs and to offer advertisers more attractive rates and services. Although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its market, there can be no assurance that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share.
 Although the broadcasting industry is highly competitive, barriers to entry exist. The operation of a broadcasting station in the United States requires a license from the FCC. Also, the number of stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of the frequencies that the FCC will license in that market, as well as by the FCC’s multiple ownership rules regulating the number of stations that may be owned or controlled by a single entity, and cross ownership rules which limit the types of media properties in any given market that can be owned by the same person or company.
 EMPLOYEES
 As of February 29, 2020, Emmis had approximately 234 full-time employees and approximately 178 part-time employees. We lease 65 full time employees and 85 part time employees to MediaCo Holding Inc. under an Employee Leasing Agreement.

FEDERAL REGULATION OF BROADCASTING
 Radio broadcasting in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”), as amended in part by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”). Radio broadcasting is prohibited except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by the grant of such license. The FCC has the power to revoke licenses for, among other things, false statements made in applications or willful or repeated violations of the Communications Act or of FCC rules. In general, the Communications Act provides that the FCC shall allocate broadcast licenses for radio stations in such a manner as will provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of service throughout the United States. The FCC determines the operating frequency, location and power of stations; regulates the equipment used by stations; and regulates numerous other areas of radio broadcasting pursuant to rules, regulations and policies adopted under authority of the Communications Act. The Communications Act, among other things, prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of an entity holding such a license without the prior approval of the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of media that compete with broadcast stations.
 The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act as well as FCC rules, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Legislation has been introduced from time to time which would amend the Communications Act in various respects, and the FCC from time to time considers new regulations or amendments to its existing regulations. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or whether new or amended FCC regulations will be adopted or what their effect would be on Emmis.
 LICENSE RENEWAL. Radio stations operate pursuant to broadcast licenses that are ordinarily granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon approval by the FCC. The following table sets forth our FCC license expiration dates in addition to the call letters, license classification, antenna elevation above average terrain (for our FM stations only), power and frequency of all owned stations as of April 1, 2020:
  
Radio Market | Stations | City of License | Frequency | | Expiration Date of License | | FCC Class | | Height Above Average Terrain (in feet) | | | Power (in Kilowatts) | 
-----------------+----------+------------------+-----------+-------+----------------------------+-------------+-----------+---+----------------------------------------+-----+-----+----------------------+------------
New York, NY | WLIB-AM | New York, NY | 1190 | | June 2022 | | B | | N/A | | | 10 D / 30 N | 
 | WEPN-FM | New York, NY | 98.7 | | June 2022 | | B | | 1362 | | | 6 | 
Indianapolis, IN | WFNI-AM | Indianapolis, IN | | 1070 | | August 2020 | | B | | N/A | | | 50 D / 10 N
 | WLHK-FM | Shelbyville, IN | | 97.1 | | August 2020 | | B | | | 732 | | | 23 
 | WIBC-FM | Indianapolis, IN | | 93.1 | | August 2020 | | B | | | 991 | | | 13.5
 | WYXB-FM | Indianapolis, IN | | 105.7 | | August 2020 | | B | | | 492 | | | 50 

 Under the Communications Act, at the time an application is filed for renewal of a station license, parties in interest, as well as members of the public, may apprise the FCC of the service the station has provided during the preceding license term and urge the denial of the application. If such a petition to deny presents information from which the FCC concludes (or if the FCC concludes on its own motion) that there is a “substantial and material” question as to whether grant of the renewal application would be in the public interest under applicable rules and policy, the FCC may conduct a hearing on specified issues to determine whether the renewal application should be granted. The Communications Act provides for the grant of a renewal application upon a finding by the FCC that the licensee:
  
• | has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | has committed no serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC rules; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | has committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC rules which would constitute a pattern of abuse.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FCC cannot make such a finding, it may deny the renewal application, and only then may the FCC consider competing applications for the same frequency. In a vast majority of cases, the FCC renews a broadcast license even when petitions to deny have been filed against the renewal application.
 REVIEW OF OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS. The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis (i.e., every four years) and to repeal or modify any of its rules that are no longer “necessary in the public interest.”
 Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCC’s rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a local market have remained largely intact since their initial adoption following the 1996 Act. The FCC’s previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. The most recent court decisions were issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in September and November 2019 and concerned the FCC’s 2014 review. On April 17, 2020, the FCC and a group of media industry stakeholders (not including Emmis) filed separate petitions for certiorari requesting that the Supreme Court of the United States review the Third Circuit’s decision. The FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review in December 2018 and that proceeding remains pending.  We cannot predict whether the appeal or forthcoming review proceeding will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business.
 The discussion below reviews the pertinent ownership rules currently in effect.
 7


Local Radio Ownership:
 The local radio ownership rule limits the number of commercial radio stations that may be owned by one entity in a given radio market based on the number of radio stations in that market:

• | if the market has 45 or more radio stations, one entity may own up to eight stations, not more than five of which may be in the same service (AM or FM);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the market has between 30 and 44 radio stations, one entity may own up to seven stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the market has between 15 and 29 radio stations, one entity may own up to six stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the market has 14 or fewer radio stations, one entity may own up to five stations, not more than three of which may be in the same service, however one entity may not own more than 50% of the stations in the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of the markets in which our radio stations are located has at least 30 radio stations.
 For purposes of applying these numerical limits, the FCC has also adopted rules with respect to (i) so-called local marketing agreements, or “LMAs,” by which the licensee of one radio station provides programming for another licensee’s radio station in the same market and sells all of the advertising within that programming and (ii) so-called joint sale agreements, or “JSAs,” by which the licensee of one station sells the advertising time on another station in the market. Under these rules, an entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time, or sells more than 15% of the advertising time, on another radio station in the same market pursuant to an LMA or JSA is generally required to count the station toward its media ownership limits even though it does not own the station. As a result, in a market where we own one or more radio stations, we generally cannot provide programming to another station under an LMA, or sell advertising on another station pursuant to a JSA, if we could not acquire that station under the local radio ownership rule. The FCC has, to date, declined to make other types of agreements such as “shared services agreements” (or “SSAs”) and/or “local news service” agreements, attributable, but has adopted a disclosure requirement for SSAs between commercial television stations.
 On April 26, 2012, a subsidiary of Emmis entered into an LMA with New York AM Radio, LLC pursuant to which, commencing April 30, 2012, it began purchasing from Emmis the right to provide programming on radio station WEPN-FM, 98.7 FM, New York, NY until August 31, 2024, subject to certain conditions. Disney Enterprises, Inc., the parent company of New York AM Radio, LLC, has guaranteed the obligations under the LMA. Emmis’ subsidiary will retain ownership of the 98.7 FM FCC license during the term of the LMA and received an annual fee of $8.4 million for the first year of the term under the LMA, which fee increases by 3.5% each year thereafter until the LMA’s termination.
 In the 2018 quadrennial review order, the FCC is requesting comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule, including whether the rule in its current form remains necessary in the public interest.
 Cross-Media Ownership:
 The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market, subject to certain exceptions and with waivers available in particular cases.
 The radio/television cross-ownership rule limits common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. In general, an individual or entity may hold attributable interests in one television station and up to seven same-market radio stations (or two television stations and up to six same-market radio stations), depending on the number of independently owned radio, television and other specified media “voices” in the market.
 ATTRIBUTION OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. In applying its ownership rules, the FCC has developed specific criteria that it uses to determine whether a certain ownership interest or other relationship with an FCC licensee is significant enough to be “attributable” or “cognizable” under its rules. Specifically, among other relationships, certain stockholders, officers and directors of a broadcasting company are deemed to have an attributable interest in the licenses held by that company, such that there would be a violation of the FCC’s rules where the broadcasting company and such a stockholder, officer or director together hold attributable interests in more than the permitted number of stations or a prohibited combination of outlets in the same market. The FCC’s regulations generally deem the following relationships and interests to be attributable for purposes of its ownership restrictions:
  
• | all officer and director positions in a licensee or its direct/indirect parent(s);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | voting stock interests of at least 5% (or 20%, if the holder is a passive institutional investor, i.e. , a mutual fund, insurance company or bank);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company where the limited partner or member has not been “insulated” from the media-related activities of the LP or LLC pursuant to specific FCC criteria;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | equity and/or debt interests which, in the aggregate, exceed 33% of the total asset value of a station or other media entity (the “equity/debt plus policy”), if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the station’s total weekly programming (usually pursuant to a time brokerage, local marketing or network affiliation agreement) or is a same-market media entity (i.e., broadcast company or newspaper). In December 2007, the FCC increased these limits under certain circumstances where the equity and/or debt interests are in a small business meeting certain requirements. Although the Third Circuit vacated the FCC’s selected definition of small businesses eligible to take advantage of these increased limits in 2011, the FCC reinstated that definition in its August 2016 order.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable, the FCC uses a “multiplier” analysis in which non-controlling voting stock interests are deemed proportionally reduced at each non-controlling link in a multi-corporation ownership chain.
 8


Under existing FCC policy, in the case of corporations having a “single majority shareholder,” the interests of minority shareholders are generally not deemed attributable. Because Jeffrey H. Smulyan’s voting interest in the Company currently exceeds 50%, this exemption appears to apply to the Company. Elimination of the exemption is, however, under consideration by the FCC. If the exemption is eliminated, or if Mr. Smulyan’s voting interest falls to or below 50%, then the interests of any minority shareholders that meet or exceed the thresholds described above would become attributable and would be combined with the Company’s interests for purposes of determining compliance with FCC ownership rules.
 Ownership-rule conflicts arising as a result of aggregating the media interests of the Company and its attributable shareholders could require divestitures by either the Company or the affected shareholders. Any such conflicts could result in Emmis being unable to obtain FCC consents necessary for future acquisitions. Conversely, Emmis’ media interests could operate to restrict other media investments by shareholders having or acquiring an interest in Emmis.
 ALIEN OWNERSHIP. Under the Communications Act, no FCC license may be held by a corporation if more than one-fifth of its capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, a foreign government or representative thereof, or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country (collectively, “Non-U.S. Persons”). Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC license may be granted to an entity directly or indirectly controlled by another entity of which more than one-fourth of its capital stock is owned or voted by Non-U.S. Persons if the FCC finds that the public interest will be served by the denial of such license. The FCC has adopted rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees and has revised the methodology that publicly traded broadcasters must use to assess their compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions. The foregoing restrictions on alien ownership apply in modified form to other types of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. In addition, an LMA with a foreign owned company is not prohibited as long as the non-foreign holder of the FCC license continues to control and operate the station. Our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Code of By-Laws authorize the Board of Directors to prohibit such restricted alien ownership, voting or transfer of capital stock as would cause Emmis to violate the Communications Act or FCC regulations.
 ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF CONTROL. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors, including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the assignee or transferee and those persons holding attributable interests therein and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on alien ownership as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements. When evaluating an assignment or transfer of control application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment of the broadcast license or transfer of control of the licensee to a party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application.
 PROGRAMMING AND OPERATION. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” Beginning in the late 1970s, the FCC gradually relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license. However, licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness.
 Federal law prohibits the broadcast of obscene material at any time and the broadcast of indecent material during specified time periods; these prohibitions are subject to enforcement by the FCC and carry fines of up to more than $400,000 per violation, with a cap exceeding $3.75 million for a continuing violation. The company has received, and may receive in the future, letters of inquiry or other notifications concerning alleged violations of the indecency rules at certain of its stations. We cannot predict the outcome of any indecency complaint proceeding or investigation or the extent or nature of future FCC enforcement actions.
 The FCC’s indecency rules have also been the subject of litigation, and are the subject of a pending proceeding regarding how the agency might revise its indecency enforcement policies.  
 Federal law also imposes sponsorship identification (or “payola”) requirements, which mandate the disclosure of information concerning programming that is paid for by third parties. The company may receive letters of inquiry or other notifications concerning alleged violations of the sponsorship identification rules at certain of its stations. We cannot predict the outcome of any sponsorship identification complaint proceeding or investigation or the extent or nature of future FCC enforcement actions.
 Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identification, equal employment opportunities, contest and lottery advertisements, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation.
 Failure to observe FCC rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary fines, the grant of “short-term” (less than the maximum term) license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.
 ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROPOSED CHANGES. The FCC has adopted rules implementing a low power FM (“LPFM”) service, and approximately 800 such stations are in operation. In November 2007, the FCC adopted rules that, among other things, enhance LPFM’s interference protection from subsequently-authorized full-service stations. Congress then passed legislation eliminating certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and LPFM stations, thereby reducing the interference protection afforded to FM stations. As required by the legislation, the FCC in January 2012 submitted a report to Congress indicating that the results of a statutorily mandated economic study indicated that, on the whole, LPFM stations do not currently have, and in the future are unlikely to have, a demonstrable economic impact on full-service commercial FM radio stations. The FCC has since modified its rules to permit the processing of additional LPFM applications and to implement the legislative requirements regarding interference protection, and has accepted applications seeking authority to construct or make major changes to LPFM facilities.  Although to date there have been very few, if any, instances of LPFM

stations interfering with full-power radio stations, we cannot predict whether any LPFM stations will actually interfere with the coverage of our radio stations in the future.
 In June 2009, the FCC adopted rules that allow an AM radio station to use currently authorized FM translator stations to retransmit the AM station’s programming within the AM station’s authorized service area. In October 2015, the FCC issued an Order that adopted a two-stage process for AM radio stations to acquire additional FM translators. The FCC has also adopted certain changes to its rules that govern AM radio stations, and has sought comment on additional changes to those rules, which remain pending.
 The FCC also previously authorized the launch and operation of a satellite digital audio radio service (“SDARS”) system. The country’s single SDARS operator, Sirius XM, provides nationwide programming service as well as channels that provide local traffic and weather information for major cities.
 In addition, the FCC permits terrestrial digital audio broadcasting (“DAB,” also known as high definition radio or “HD Radio®”) by FM stations, and has pending a proceeding to permit digital operations by AM stations. 
 In order to broadcast musical compositions or to stream them over the Internet, Emmis must pay royalties to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers). These copyright owners often rely on organizations known as performing rights organizations, which negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties, and distribute them to copyright owners. The three major performing rights organizations, from which Emmis has licenses and to which Emmis pays royalties, are the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), and SESAC, Inc. These rates are set periodically, are often negotiated by organizations acting on behalf of broadcasters, and may increase in the future. It also is possible that songwriters or publishers may disassociate with these performing rights organizations, or that additional such organizations could emerge in the future. In 2013 a new performing rights organization, named Global Music Rights (“GMR”), was formed. GMR has obtained the rights to certain high-value copyrights and is seeking to negotiate individual licensing agreements with radio stations for songs within its repertoire. GMR and the Radio Music License Committee, Inc. (“RMLC”), which negotiates music licensing fees with performance rights organizations on behalf of many radio stations, have initiated antitrust litigation against one another, which remains pending. The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is also reviewing consent decrees governing ASCAP and BMI to determine whether those consent decrees should be modified.  If a significant number of musical composition copyright owners withdraw from the established performing rights organizations, if new performing rights organizations form to license compositions that are not already licensed, or if the consent decrees between the DOJ and ASCAP/BMI are materially modified or eliminated, Emmis’ royalty rates or negotiation costs could increase. Emmis’ royalty rates or negotiation costs could also change as a result of GMR/RMLC litigation or the resolution of the full-work licensing issue.
 In order to stream music over the Internet, Emmis must also obtain licenses and pay royalties to the owners of copyrights in sound recordings (typically, artists and record companies). These royalties are in addition to royalties for Internet streaming that must also be paid to performance rights organizations. The Copyright Royalty Board (“CRB”) recently completed its proceeding to set rates for the 2016-2020 license period. The CRB set a rate during this period for performances by non-subscription noninteractive services of 0.17 cent per listener per song, and a rate for noninteractive subscription services of 0.22 cent per listener per song, both of which are subject to changes that mirror changes in the Consumer Price Index. The CRB’s 2016-2020 rates represent a decrease from the 2015 CRB rates applicable to broadcasters and other webcasters.  A proceeding to establish the rates for 2021-2025 began in 2019.
 In addition, lawsuits have been filed under various state laws challenging the right of digital audio transmission services and broadcasters to publicly perform or reproduce sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 (“pre-1972 sound recordings”) without a license. Federal legislation signed into law in October 2018 applies a statutory licensing regime to pre-1972 sound recordings similar to that which governs post-1972 sound recordings. Among other things, the new law extends remedies for copyright infringement to owners of pre-1972 sound recordings when recordings are used without authorization. The public performance right that the new law creates for pre-1972 recordings streamed online may increase our licensing costs.
 Legislation also has previously been introduced in Congress that would require the payment of performance royalties to artists, musicians, or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations, ending a long-standing copyright law exception. If enacted, such legislation could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming.
 Congress and the FCC also have under consideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of additional matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations and/or affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include, but are not limited to:
  
• | proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to repeal or modify some or all of the FCC’s multiple ownership rules and/or policies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to impose requirements intended to promote broadcasters’ service to their local communities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | technical and frequency allocation matters;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | AM stereo broadcasting;
--+------------------------


• | proposals to modify service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to tighten safety guidelines relating to radio frequency radiation exposure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals permitting FM stations to accept formerly impermissible interference;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to reinstate holding periods for licenses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------

• | changes to broadcast technical requirements related to the implementation of SDARS;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to modify broadcasters’ public interest obligations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to regulate violence and hate speech in broadcasts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We cannot predict whether any proposed changes will be adopted, what other matters might be considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business.
 The foregoing is only a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act as well as FCC regulations, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
