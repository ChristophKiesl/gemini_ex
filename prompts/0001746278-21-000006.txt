Item 1. Description of Business
Business Development
 
We are a development-stage company, incorporated on January 29, 2018 in the State of Nevada, with a fiscal year end of December 31. We lease a property at Kemp House, 152 - 160 City Road, London EC1V 2NX, United Kingdom. Our telephone number is: 442038078230. The only employee of the Company is its sole officer and director, Vadim Rata. We are a development-stage company that intends to develop, market and sell a subscription-based income/expense tracking application service. The management is also discussing providing a secure physical wallet that only opens once an expenditure/earning is reflected in the application. To date, our operations have been limited to researching the marketplace for our proposed income/expense application product possibly connected to a physical wallet and the issues entailed in developing these products, as well as the preliminary design and development of our website. We have not yet implemented our business model or undertaken development of our proposed income/expense product nor the possible physical wallet. To date, we have generated no revenues from our operations. There can be no assurances that our efforts to develop our proposed income/expense service will succeed, or that we will be able to market our proposed income/expense service or the potential physical wallet, if developed.
Our Business
 
We intend to develop, launch, market and sell (via subscription), what will be (depending on user preferences) the most secure income/expense tracking system available today. We are considering development of a physical wallet with a Bluetooth lock controlled by our application on effectiveness of its functionality, available pricing of the product, designs and materials to use.

Why physical wallet?
 In future, once we start generating revenues, we plan on developing a physical wallet with a lock on it. The lock will open via Bluetooth at a moment a user makes an entry to the application. That way we will exclude a chance for an expense or an income occur and stay unrecorded, thus, significantly increasing the efficiency of the users budget planning and monitoring of their monies. The scope of the project is huge, and we expect it to take at least 12 months to be completed. 

Monetization of the project:
 We plan on providing one-month free trial for users to look-and-feel its usage comfort and enjoy its design. After that, users will be offered to purchase in-app subscriptions for 6/12/24 months. They will be able to pay simply using a credit/debit card that has been previously linked to the App.

Further, when the business is successful and as the physical wallets are developed, they will be available for sale on our website or purchased through the App. 

The wallets will be delivered to their new owners with a promo-code of one-year App subscription.

Monetization from in-app advertisements will also be one of our income sources. We also maintain website at lovarra.com
