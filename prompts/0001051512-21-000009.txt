Item 1. Business
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) provides high-quality communications services to customers with 5.0 million wireless connections and 1.2 million wireline and cable connections at December 31, 2020. TDS conducts all of its wireless operations through its majority-owned subsidiary, United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular). As of December 31, 2020, TDS owned 82% of the combined total of the outstanding Common Shares and Series A Common Shares of UScellular and controlled 96% of the combined voting power of both classes of UScellular common stock. TDS provides broadband, video and voice services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TDS Telecommunications LLC (TDS Telecom). TDS Common Shares trade under the ticker symbol “TDS” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). UScellular Common Shares trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “USM.”
Under listing standards of the NYSE, TDS is a “controlled company” as such term is defined by the NYSE. TDS is a controlled company because over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of TDS is held by the trustees of the TDS Voting Trust.
TDS has three business segments: UScellular and TDS Telecom’s Wireline and Cable. TDS operations also include the operations of its wholly-owned hosted and managed services (HMS) subsidiary, which operates under the OneNeck IT Solutions brand, and its wholly-owned printing subsidiary Suttle-Straus, Inc. (Suttle-Straus). HMS' and Suttle-Straus’ financial results were not significant to TDS’ operations. TDS operates entirely in the United States. Additional information about TDS’ segments is incorporated herein by reference from Note 19 — Business Segment Information in TDS’ Annual Report to Shareholders, filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.
The map below highlights TDS’ consolidated areas of operations:
UScellular OPERATIONS
General
UScellular provides wireless telecommunications services to customers with 5.0 million connections in portions of 21 states collectively representing a total population of 31 million. UScellular operates in one reportable segment, and all of its wireless operating markets are in the United States. 
Business Development and Community Focus
UScellular’s strategy is to attract and retain customers through a value proposition comprising a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing - all provided with a community focus. 
UScellular operates a regional wireless network. UScellular’s interests in wireless spectrum licenses include both direct interests whereby UScellular is the licensee and investment interests in entities which are licensees; together, these direct and investment interests involve operating and non-operating wireless spectrum licenses covering portions of 30 states and a total population of approximately 51 million at December 31, 2020.
As part of its business development strategy, UScellular may periodically be engaged in negotiations relating to strategic partnerships and/or the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties, investment interests or wireless spectrum, including through FCC auctions. The FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. Historically, UScellular has participated in certain FCC auctions both directly and indirectly through its limited partnership interests. 
UScellular has a longstanding commitment to supporting its local communities through donations and volunteerism. UScellular focuses its Corporate Social Responsibility program on philanthropic investments and volunteer engagement activities on K-12 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) to support youth in the communities UScellular serves through exclusive partnerships with organizations such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America and JASON Learning. Since 2015, The Future of Good program has demonstrated UScellular's commitment to the communities that it serves by highlighting and supporting young humanitarians that have taken extraordinary actions to make their communities a better place. In 2020, UScellular began exploring ways to leverage its assets, brand, partnerships, and resources to begin to close the digital divide with a focus on ensuring all youth in its markets have reliable and fast internet access in school and at home.
Customers, Services, Products and Seasonality
Customers. UScellular focuses on consumer, business and government customers located in its operating markets. These customers are served primarily through UScellular’s retail and direct sales channels. 
Services. UScellular provides a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of handsets and connected devices. A postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. UScellular’s prepaid service enables individuals to obtain services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. Approximately 90% of retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2020.
UScellular offers various service plans tailored to the needs of customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, service plans may include features related to, among other things: unlimited or metered voice and data; high definition video features; the ability to use a device as a Wi-Fi hotspot; and varying data rates depending on the plan and usage on that plan. Service offerings vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions - and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.
UScellular offers advanced wireless solutions to consumers and business and government customers, including a fast-growing and expansive suite of connected Internet of things (IoT) solutions and software applications across the categories of monitor and control (e.g., sensors and cameras), business automation/operations (e.g., e-forms), communication (e.g., enterprise messaging, back-up router for business continuity services), asset management (e.g., navigation system, fleet management), smart water solutions, and custom, bespoke end-to-end IoT solutions et al. Additionally, for first responders, UScellular offers both Wireless Priority Services (WPS) and Quality Priority and Preemption (QPP) options. UScellular intends to continue to further enhance these offerings for customers in 2021 and beyond. 
Products. UScellular offers a comprehensive range of devices such as smartphones and other handsets, tablets, wearables, mobile hotspots, routers, and IoT devices. In addition, UScellular also offers a wide range of accessories, including wireless essentials such as cases, screen protectors, chargers, and memory cards as well as an assortment of consumer electronics such as headphones, smart speakers, and home automation and business management solutions (e.g., cameras, video doorbells, networking and monitoring devices). UScellular allows customers to purchase certain devices and accessories on installment plans, allowing for customers to pay over a specified period of time.
UScellular also offers services that enable customers to replace or repair their devices, including the Device Protection+ program, which provides as soon as next-day delivery of a replacement device for damaged, lost and stolen devices, and AppleCare services for Apple iOS customers. Its Device Protection+ Advanced program also includes local or on-demand repair for eligible devices. In addition, UScellular offers a Trade-In program through which UScellular buys customers' used equipment.
UScellular purchases devices and accessory products from a number of original equipment manufacturers and distributors. UScellular manages relationships with its suppliers to ensure best possible pricing and identifies opportunities for promotional support from its suppliers. UScellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure; rather, it contracts with third party providers for the majority of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities. UScellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device service programs.
Seasonality. Seasonality in operating expenses may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter. UScellular’s operating expenses tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season.
Sales and Distribution Channels
UScellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, telesales, ecommerce, independent agents and third-party national retailers.
Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless services and products to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. Direct sales representatives sell traditional wireless services as well as IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) products and solutions to medium and large-sized businesses and governmental entities. Additionally, the telesales and ecommerce channels enable customers to purchase services and devices via phone and online, respectively.
UScellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents (collectively “agents”), which are independent businesses that obtain customers for UScellular on a commission basis. UScellular provides support and training to its agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience. UScellular’s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service plans and other related products.
In order to expand its retail presence, UScellular also maintains relationships with national retailers. National retailers sell prepaid devices, and some also sell postpaid devices.
Competition
The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive. UScellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets. In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which UScellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In its footprint, UScellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile USA, and an emerging Dish as the fourth national carrier, in addition to smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint. In addition, UScellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar services and products.
Since each of these competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of services and products, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service. Types of services and products include non–wireless related services such as content offerings that are bundled with wireless services. 
Technology
Network Technology. Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice and data signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections. A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, is an important factor for UScellular to remain competitive.
UScellular continues to devote efforts to enhance its network capabilities. UScellular has completed its deployment of VoLTE technology. VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services and offers enhanced services such as high definition voice and simultaneous voice and data sessions. 
5G technology helps address customers’ growing demand for data services and creates opportunities for new services requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. UScellular's 5G deployment is initially focused on mobility services using its low band spectrum. UScellular has acquired high band spectrum, which it will deploy in the future to further enable the delivery of 5G services. UScellular has launched commercial 5G services in portions of California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin and will continue to launch in additional areas in the coming years. In addition to the deployment of 5G technology, UScellular is also modernizing its 4G LTE network to further enhance 4G LTE speeds.
Roaming. Inter-carrier roaming agreements are negotiated between wireless operators to enable customers who are in a service area other than the customer’s home service area to use wireless services in that service area. UScellular has entered into 4G LTE and VoLTE roaming agreements with national wireless companies and, as a result, customers have access to these services on a nationwide basis. In addition, UScellular offers a variety of international roaming options. UScellular is pursuing and expects to introduce 5G roaming in 2021.
TDS TELECOM OPERATIONS
General
TDS Telecom provides communications services to 1.2 million connections in 32 states. TDS Telecom operates through two reportable segments: Wireline and Cable. TDS Telecom has a common growth strategy across all of its businesses to provide high-speed broadband services bundled with video and voice services. TDS Telecom strives to be the dominant broadband provider in the markets it serves by investing into high-quality networks and providing excellent customer service. 
Operations
TDS Telecom operates as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) in 25 states and as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Wireline operations are located across nearly 900 rural, suburban, and metropolitan communities within the U.S, with the largest concentrations of customers in the Upper Midwest and the Southeast. TDS Telecom’s cable business leverages its Wireline core competencies in network management and customer focus and operates under two brand names: TDS Cable in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah; and BendBroadband in Oregon. On December 31, 2019, TDS Telecom extended its Cable operations into North Carolina through the acquisition of substantially all the assets of MI Connection Communications System, dba Continuum. 
TDS Telecom is also investing in a fiber-to-the-home program in new markets to expand its wireline network and drive growth. Regional markets, selected for their favorable growth criteria, have been launched in Central and Southern Wisconsin, and the Pacific Northwest centered around Coeur d'Alene and Meridian, Idaho and Spokane, Washington.
TDS Telecom focuses on broadband as the core component of its service offerings. It believes that both residential and business customers have a strong preference to purchase complementary communications services from a single provider. TDS Telecom’s strategy is to expand its broadband services and to augment that growth by bundling with video and voice services to build customer loyalty. Through investment in plant upgrades and improvements in programming and customer service levels, TDS Telecom intends to strengthen its markets and continue to grow its revenue base.
Through its Wireline markets, TDS Telecom also provides services to wholesale customers, which are primarily interexchange carriers (companies that provide long-distance telephone and data services between local exchange areas) and wireless carriers that compensate TDS Telecom for the use of its facilities to originate and terminate their voice and data transmissions. 
Growth Strategy
Both Wireline and Cable share a common growth strategy to provide high-speed broadband services bundled with video entertainment and voice services. TDS Telecom is investing in fiber in new and existing markets to provide broadband speeds of up to 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps) and to expand its footprint.
Increased fiber deployment provides the opportunity to deliver more robust residential and commercial products which drives future growth. Fiber builds in strategically selected locations allow TDS Telecom to target attractive, growing markets to increase its total footprint. TDS Telecom continues to scale up its out-of-territory fiber builds beginning with a trial market in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin in 2017. 
Construction is nearly complete in six additional communities around TDS Telecom’s headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin which are a natural extension to Sun Prairie and existing ILEC markets. Eight additional communities create a Central Wisconsin cluster, also adjacent to existing ILEC markets. An anchor market in the Pacific Northwest was established in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, and recent additions include Meridian, Idaho and Spokane, Washington. 
Similarly, in its Cable markets, TDS Telecom is focused on providing high-speed broadband services, offering up to 1 Gbps data speeds utilizing DOCSIS 3.1 network upgrades to its network, and investing in fiber-to-the-home construction in new housing developments in these fast-growing communities.
TDS Telecom may also seek to grow its operations through the acquisition of businesses that support and complement its existing markets or create entirely new clusters of markets where TDS Telecom can succeed. TDS Telecom intends to avoid markets served by other fiber overbuilders or municipalities which have constructed their own networks with fiber to the home.
Technology
TDS Telecom continues to upgrade and enhance its networks by utilizing various technologies to increase levels of performance and provide additional speed and security to increase value for its customers.
In order to provide IP-based services, TDS Telecom has developed and deployed an inter-regional data routing infrastructure using owned and leased fiber capacity which allows it to leverage its 100-gigabit core network. This configuration, along with the continued development of an IP network that interconnects substantially all the existing service territories, provides redundancy and allows for next generation IP service offerings.
TDS Telecom utilizes centralized monitoring and management of its core network to reduce costs and improve service reliability. TDS Telecom continues to standardize equipment and processes to increase efficiency in maintaining its network. Network standardization has aided TDS Telecom in operating its 24-hours-a-day/7-days-per-week Network Management Centers, which continuously monitor the network to proactively identify and correct network faults prior to any customer impact. 
Wireline operates an integrated, highly reliable network that consists of central office host and remote sites, primarily equipped with digital and IP switches. Fiber optic and copper cable connect the host central offices with remote switches and ultimately with the end customer. Wireline continues to upgrade and expand its telecommunications network to respond to the needs of its customers for greater bandwidth and advanced technologies. The network is transitioning from its legacy circuit-switched network to a highly reliable IP-based broadband network to facilitate the integration of broadband, video and voice services. 
Since 2012, Wireline has pursued a plan to deploy fiber-to-the-home technology, which enables significantly greater broadband speeds to selected residential subdivisions and to commercial customers, when the investment is economically justified. Fiber technology is deployed to provide internet speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Fiber-to-the-home technology is also used in all out-of-territory builds. In addition, in non-fiber markets, data speeds are increased using fiber-to-the-node and copper bonding/vectoring technology, providing speeds of 10 to 100 Megabits per second (Mbps).
Cable’s telecommunication systems are designed to transmit broadband, video and voice services using a hybrid fiber-coaxial network that consists of optical fiber transport from a headend facility to nodes where coaxial cable is then used to reach residential and business customers. In certain markets, Cable has an all-fiber network to the home or business. Both of these fiber-rich networks offer substantial bandwidth capacity and, leveraging DOCSIS 3.1 technology, enable Cable to offer robust broadband, video and voice services. 
Customers, Services and Products
Residential. TDS Telecom residential customer operations provide high-speed broadband, video and voice services. These services are bundled at competitive prices to encourage cross-selling within the customer base and to attract new customers. Approximately 75% of Wireline and 50% of Cable residential customers have at least two services. 
▪Broadband: TDS Telecom offers reliable high-speed internet connections and all-home WI-FI. Fiber technology is being deployed to select markets to provide internet speeds of up to 1 Gbps. In certain non-fiber markets, TDS Telecom is deploying fiber-to-the-node and copper-based vectoring/pair bonding technology to increase data speeds reaching up to 100 Mbps. DOCSIS 3.1 technology is utilized across nearly all Cable markets and offers speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Premium security and support services are available to enhance the customers’ high-speed internet experience.
▪Video: TDS Telecom provides advanced home TV entertainment that includes basic channels and premium programming available in high-definition television combined with a digital video recording (DVR) service. TDS Telecom offers a next-generation video platform called TDS TV+ which enhances the customer experience by combining linear and non-linear programming, adding interfaces to mobile devices, personalized content recommendations, and network-based DVR functionality. TDS TV+ is an integrated cloud television platform that offers video content and features not available on existing TDS platforms. In certain Wireline markets TDS Telecom partners with a satellite TV provider to offer digital television.
▪Voice: Call plans include local and long-distance telephone service, VoIP and enhanced services like Find-Me/Follow-Me, collaboration, instant messaging and more. Many features are bundled with calling plans to give customers the best value.
Commercial. TDS Telecom commercial customer operations provide secure and reliable broadband, IP-based services, and hosted voice and video collaboration services to small- and medium-sized businesses. TDS Telecom's commercial service focus is to lead with broadband bundled with a voice product from a suite of solutions and TDS TV for business.
Wholesale. Wireline’s wholesale market focus is on access revenues, which is the compensation received from the interexchange carriers for carrying data and voice traffic on TDS Telecom’s networks. Federal Connect America Fund (CAF), including A-CAM, and state Universal Service Fund (USF) revenues, which support the cost of providing communication services in underserved high cost areas, are also included in wholesale service revenues.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution Channels and Customer Service
Marketing. TDS Telecom’s marketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of services and products built around customer needs at fair prices with a local focus. TDS Telecom uses door-to-door selling, digital marketing, targeted mailings and mass advertising to market services and products. TDS Telecom differentiates itself from competitors using a hyper-localized sales marketing effort to maximize broadband penetration. This approach utilizes area specific marketing plans and community events combined with a bundling strategy.
Sales and Distribution Channels. TDS Telecom operates and uses sales contact centers, direct sales forces, retail stores, sales agents and an online platform to sell services and products.
Customer Service. TDS Telecom manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through extensive training of front-line sales and support associates that administer customer-friendly processes. 
Competition
TDS Telecom faces competition from other cable providers, fiber overbuilders, low-cost voice providers, satellite providers, other wireline and wireless providers. Furthermore, the use of alternative communications services such as text messages, video conferencing, and social networks has reduced the demand for traditional voice services.
Cable companies have developed technological improvements that have allowed them to extend their competitive operations beyond major markets and have enabled them to provide a broader range of data and voice services over their cable networks. Cable companies have aggressively pursued the bundling of internet, video, voice and mobile service at discounted prices to attract customers from traditional telephone companies. In addition, cable companies continue to add value to their internet offerings by increasing speeds at little to no additional cost to the customer. Wireline estimates that 80% of its ILEC service addresses face active competition from cable providers at December 31, 2020. Cable companies are increasingly targeting commercial customers.
Wireless telephone service providers offering feature-rich wireless devices and improved networks, including fixed wireless and the latest 5G technology, constitute a source of voice and emerging broadband competition. A growing segment of customers have chosen to completely forego the use of traditional wireline services and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice communications services. This trend is more pronounced among residential voice connections, where those connections comprise approximately 44% of total residential Wireline connections as of December 31, 2020. However, the majority of these voice connections bundle with other products, reducing the risk of churn. Some small businesses have followed the residential path by choosing wireless service and disconnecting wireline voice service. 
Approximately 15% of TDS Telecom's Wireline connections are within CLEC operations using facilities leased from the incumbent carrier. These carriers are continuing to implement technological changes that could impede TDS Telecom's access to facilities used to provide CLEC communications services. In addition, the FCC has issued an order that eliminates the requirements that allow CLECs to access that infrastructure at wholesale rates. To mitigate these risks, TDS Telecom has refocused the business on serving customers who do not require leased facilities. 
The strategy of the Cable segment is focused on broadband to capitalize on the data needs of consumers. Cable seeks to be the leading provider of broadband and video services in its targeted markets. From a broadband perspective, Cable competes against the incumbent local telephone providers which primarily offer DSL-based services. Cable offers a superior, higher bandwidth data product using DOCSIS technology. Video competition is primarily from satellite providers and streaming video providers, and on a limited basis, telephone companies that offer video services and compete for broadband and voice customers. Other telecommunications providers, including internet-based VoIP providers, fiber companies and wireless providers may compete directly for both residential and commercial voice and broadband service customers. Changes in consumer behavior or new technologies or both could cause consumers to reduce or cancel their cable video services and instead seek to obtain video on demand over the internet or through new technologies. Cable systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises; therefore, competing cable systems may be built in the same area.
TDS Telecom continues to develop and maintain an efficient cost structure to ensure that it can compete with price-based initiatives from competitors. In addition to price, TDS Telecom competes based on a variety of factors including the reliability of its network, the diversity and range of its product offerings and customer service. In addition, TDS Telecom is selecting to grow in areas where it has determined customers are underserved in terms of these criteria. 
TDS — REGULATION
TDS’ operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation. Key regulatory considerations are discussed below.
UScellular
The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act). The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of wireless spectrum licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act.
Wireless spectrum licenses segmented by geographic areas are granted by the FCC. The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system, requires prior FCC approval. The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses is in the public interest. Wireless spectrum licenses are granted generally for a ten-year term or, in some cases, for a twelve-year or fifteen-year term. The FCC establishes the standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications. All of UScellular’s wireless spectrum licenses for which it applied for renewal since 1995 have been renewed. UScellular expects to continue to meet the criteria of the FCC’s license renewal process.
As part of its data services, UScellular provides internet access. Such internet access services may be subject to different regulatory requirements than other wireless services.
Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, including billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning, land use, privacy, data security and consumer protection. Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae.
TDS Telecom
The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over all facilities of, and services offered by, TDS Telecom’s ILECs as telecommunications common carriers, to the extent they provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. State public utility commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications facilities and services. In addition, the Wireline business is subject to various other state and local laws, including laws relating to privacy, data security and consumer protection.
The Communications Act requires, among other things, that telecommunications common carriers offer interstate services when requested at just and reasonable rates at terms and conditions that are non-discriminatory. Maximum rates for regulated interstate services are prescribed by the FCC. In many states, local rates paid by end user customers and intrastate access charges paid by carriers continue to be subject to state commission approval.
TDS Telecom’s CLEC and out-of-territory fiber operations are subject to similar but reduced regulation compared to ILECs.
As a cable multiple systems operator (MSO), Cable is subject to regulation by the FCC, covering matters such as technical operations, administrative requirements, consumer protection, access by people with disabilities, customer privacy and content. The operation of cable systems requires the MSO to obtain franchises from state or local governmental authorities to occupy public rights of way with network facilities. These franchises typically are nonexclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations, and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a standard percentage of revenues.
TDS’ Cable operations also provide interconnected VoIP and broadband services, including internet access, while the Wireline operations use a traditional circuit-switched voice service that is regulated as a telecommunications common carrier service. TDS Telecom also provides interconnected VoIP, which is currently subject to less regulation.
General
