ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
nVent Electric plc is a leading global provider of electrical connection and protection solutions. We believe our inventive electrical solutions enable safer systems and ensure a more secure world. We design, manufacture, market, install and service high performance products and solutions that connect and protect some of the world’s most sensitive equipment, buildings and critical processes. We offer a comprehensive range of enclosures, electrical fastening solutions and thermal management solutions across industry-leading brands that are recognized globally for quality, reliability and innovation. 
Our broad range of products and solutions connect and protect our customers’ mission-critical equipment from hazardous conditions, improving their utilization, lowering costs and minimizing downtime. The cost of our products typically represents a small proportion of the total cost of our customers’ end systems. We also are a small cost relative to the potential cost of failure that our products help avoid. We have a portfolio of premier, industry-leading brands, including nVent CADDY, ERICO, HOFFMAN, RAYCHEM, SCHROFF and TRACER, some of which have a history spanning over 100 years, that cover a wide range of verticals, including Industrial, Commercial & Residential, Energy and Infrastructure. 
Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to "nVent," the "Company," and such words as "we," "us," and "our" include nVent Electric plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our principal office is in London, United Kingdom and our management office in the United States ("U.S.") is in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company was incorporated in Ireland on May 30, 2017. Although our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and have our tax residency in the U.K.
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
On April 30, 2018, Pentair plc ("Pentair" or "former Parent") completed the separation of its Water business and its Electrical business into two independent, publicly-traded companies (the "separation"). To effect the separation, Pentair distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of nVent for every ordinary share of Pentair held as of the record date of April 17, 2018. As a result of the distribution, nVent is now an independent publicly-traded company and began "regular way" trading under the symbol "NVT" on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2018. 
Our roots within Pentair trace back to the acquisition of Federal-Hoffman Corporation in 1988, which included the nVent HOFFMAN enclosures brand. From that starting point, we have grown both organically and via acquisition. Our Enclosures business first applied lean principles within the organization in the 1990s, leveraging its culture of customer service and operational excellence. In 2012, Pentair merged with Tyco International Ltd.’s Flow Control division, which included our Thermal Management business and the nVent RAYCHEM brand, a global leader in heat tracing solutions. In 2015, Pentair acquired ERICO Global Company, a leading global manufacturer of superior engineered electrical and fastening products, which operates as our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business, broadening our product offering and enabling us to provide additional global solutions to our combined customers. 
We aim to continue our journey as a “One nVent” organization, with unified focus on commercial excellence, digital transformation, scaled and integrated technology, including Internet of Things (“IoT”), and global presence and capabilities. As we scale our capabilities under our umbrella brand of nVent, we expect to expand our products and solutions and to continue to differentiate our company by creating solutions that solve problems for our customers. 
Our Spark management system defines how we operate. The five elements of Spark are People, Growth, Lean, Digital and Velocity. Together, they provide the mindset and operating system to propel the success of our company. Spark supports the high performance culture we are building at nVent. 
•People are at the core of Spark, positively impacting our business and growing their careers.
•Growth is the foundation of Spark, driving shareholder, customer and employee value.
•Lean is the relentless pursuit of eliminating waste and increasing velocity.
•Digital transforms our products and how we do business, improving both customer and employee experiences.
•Velocity is increasing speed in all we do for each other and our customers.
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
We operate across three segments: Enclosures, Electrical & Fastening Solutions and Thermal Management. The following is a brief description of each of the Company's reportable segments and business activities.

Electrical & Fastening Solutions 
Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business provides fastening solutions that connect and protect electrical and mechanical systems and civil structures. 
We are a global leader in fastening solutions with spring steel and specialty metal fixings and reinforced steel connections, and our products are primarily marketed under the nVent CADDY brand.

We offer a comprehensive range of facility electrical connection and protection solutions to protect against electrical transients to improve safety and reliability of electrical systems. Our products reduce total cost of ownership and provide design flexibility by offering maintenance free and reliable products and global end-user application expertise and intimacy. These products are targeted towards commercial, infrastructure and industrial verticals with applications in telecommunication, power distribution and facility electrical protection. These products and solutions are primarily used by electricians, panel builders, energy contractors and lightning protection installers. 
Thermal Management 
Our Thermal Management business provides electric thermal solutions that connect and protect critical buildings, infrastructure, industrial processes and people. Its highly reliable and easy-to-install solutions lower total cost of ownership to building owners, facility managers, operators and end users.

Impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic 
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 ("COVID-19") in 2020 resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including worldwide travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential work activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets, all of which resulted in COVID-19 having an impact on our financial performance in fiscal 2020. As this pandemic endures and continues to have an impact on global economic activity, the extent to which COVID-19 adversely impacts our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to COVID-19, refer to ITEM 1A "Risk Factors" and ITEM 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", included in this Form 10-K.
Competition 
The markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive. We compete against large and well-established national and global companies, as well as regional and local companies and lower-cost manufacturers. Some of our competitors, in particular smaller companies, attempt to compete based primarily on price, localized expertise and local relationships, especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise. In addition, during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price. Competition focuses on product performance, price, quality and service.
Our success depends on a variety of factors, including technical expertise, reputation for quality and reliability, timeliness of delivery, previous installation history, contractual terms and price. As many of our products sell through electrical distributors, data center contractors, original equipment manufacturers and maintenance contractors, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel and distribution network. 
Seasonality 
We generally experience increased demand for Electrical & Fastening Solutions products during the spring and summer months in the Northern Hemisphere and increased demand for Thermal Management products and services during the fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.
Backlog of Orders by Segment
 | December 31 | | 
In millions | 2020 | 2019 | $ change | % change
Enclosures | $ | 117.0 | | $ | 114.3 | $ | 2.7 | 2.4 | %
Electrical & Fastening Solutions | 34.1 | | 28.8 | | 5.3 | 18.4 | 
Thermal Management | 155.9 | | 156.7 | | (0.8) | (0.5) | 
Total | $ | 307.0 | | $ | 299.8 | $ | 7.2 | 2.4 | %

A substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and products delivered in the same month. Our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order. However, a portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order. We record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. We expect the majority of our backlog at December 31, 2020 will be shipped in 2021.
Raw materials
The principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels.
We purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the future.
Intellectual property
Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Captive insurance subsidiary
We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers' compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Tonka Bay Insurance Company ("Tonka Bay"). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals are established with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Tonka Bay liabilities and those of certain non-U.S. operations.
Matters pertaining to Tonka Bay are discussed in ITEM 3, included in this Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL MATTERS
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 8,800 people worldwide.
Response to COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the evolving impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive steps to help protect the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as maintain the continuity of our business. We quickly created a cross-functional, global Enterprise COVID-19 Response Task Force to track and address COVID cases and impacts in the locations around the world where our employees live and work. Many of our office workers began to, and continue to, work remotely. Within our manufacturing and office areas in each region where we operate, taking into account government guidance and local recommendations, we implemented safety protocols such as face masks, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and temperature checks. In addition, we have implemented new communication channels and increased the level of communication from our leaders to better inform and support our employees. 
Inclusion and Diversity
We aspire to be an equitable, inclusive and diverse company. We believe that the unique contributions of individuals with varying backgrounds and experiences will benefit our businesses. Guided by our Win Right values, we are committed to creating a workplace culture where everyone is included and respected. Our Code of Conduct spells out our commitment to equal opportunity and fair treatment for all. We do not tolerate acts of harassment, including any conduct or statements made on the basis of protected status that are intimidating, hostile or abusive.
Our leaders actively support and encourage employee development and engagement, including through our CEO Inclusion Council and an active Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Council. These councils promote inclusion across all dimensions of diversity.
We also support our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which were created organically by our employees and which provide a support system to foster awareness, promote inclusion and respect and provide a sounding board on strategic initiatives for nVent. Open to all employees, the ERGs are designed to create connections and opportunities for development, training and community involvement. In 2020, we had approximately 400 members globally in the following ERGs:
•Grass Roots – raises awareness and encourages the adoption of sustainable practices among nVent employees, and identifies opportunities for the company to improve its sustainability efforts.
•Global Women’s Network – offers education, networking, development and business opportunities for women at all levels.
•Connecting Cultures – provides a safe, educational, open space for individuals to broaden their understanding and appreciation of multiculturalism, inclusion and diversity.
•Allies – focuses on ensuring a safe space for our LGBTQ+ employees by providing education and awareness such as the use of pronouns and LBGTQ+ 101 training.
In 2020, we expanded our training offerings and mentoring programs, and focused on communications. An Inclusion Index was embedded into our Engagement Survey. Our employees from around the globe engaged in panel discussions on the topics of race and bias. We also built the platform for the beginnings of a Supplier Diversity program in early 2021. Our Chief Executive Officer has signed the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity and Inclusion as we joined the Minnesota Business Partnership on Diversity and Inclusion.
Our culture and values focus on our people. We intentionally built inclusion and diversity into our culture from nVent’s start. During 2020, we provided opportunities for our employees to openly discuss their perspectives about social injustice, and inclusion and diversity with over 50 listening circles, and panel discussions. We are also committed to ongoing efforts to combat racism.
Gender Diversity In The Workplace (as of December 31, 2020):
•44% of our executive leadership team are female; 56% are male
•24% of our global management team are female; 76% are male
•23% of all other employees are female; 77% are male
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to offer our employees across the world comprehensive benefit programs that reflect the market practices in their country of employment. We participate in and review remuneration surveys from leading, independent consultants for all of our countries so that we have the information to set competitive wages and salaries. 
We are dedicated to providing equitable compensation as a commitment to our people. By focusing on equitable pay, we enhance our ability to grow, retain and motivate diverse employees on our team. We believe diverse teams drive innovation, connection and growth for our employees.
As part of this commitment to our people, we conduct pay parity reviews of our compensation systems. The goal of these reviews is to ensure internal pay alignment and equitable treatment for employees, as well as providing competitive and performance-based pay. 
Employee Engagement and Development
We believe it is important to hear from our employees to learn about what we are doing well, and where we can become stronger. In 2020, we completed our second global Employee Engagement Survey with targeted questions about inclusion and our strengths as an employer. All employees were invited to participate in the survey and provide confidential feedback. We had an 85% participation rate, and achieved an eight-point favorability increase in employee satisfaction compared to our 2018 survey. All of our people managers were required to share survey results with their teams, and develop action plans to address specific areas of improvement.
We are also committed to supporting the development of our employees. In 2020, we launched a variety of tools and training to enable our employees to develop a better understanding of their strengths and development opportunities. Our professional employees were asked to create individual development plans identifying key competencies to continue to grow or develop. With the goal of aligning development with retention, we also encourage our employees to regularly engage with their managers to discuss their performance, development and career aspirations.
Code of Conduct Training 
Our Code of Conduct training is completed by approximately 3,600 professional employees each year. The courses are offered in 12 different languages to employees in 34 countries. Topics in 2020 included nVent’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, Unconscious Bias, Harassment and Preventing Fraud. In 2020, we completed the training with 100% completion rate among professional employees. Additionally we launched role-based training in the areas of Trade Compliance and Antitrust.
In 2020, a live Code of Conduct training program for our offline, shop floor employees was introduced to sites in the United States, China and the Netherlands. 
We provide multiple ways for employees to ask for help and report misconduct and illegal or unethical behavior, including doing so anonymously. A Helpline is available on our website (www.nventethics.com) and is available 24/7 and accessible in over 200 languages. We are committed to investigating and responding to reported concerns. nVent prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises concerns or makes good-faith reports regarding possible breaches of law or policy or ethical violations.
Workplace Health and Safety
The safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority. We are committed to preventing workplace injuries and maintaining a positive, healthy work environment. We encourage our employees to put safety first, speak up when they observe unsafe conditions or behaviors and follow all safety practices. We expect our employees to maintain a workplace free from illegal or controlled substances, weapons or potentially dangerous devices, and we strive for all nVent locations to meet or exceed all applicable Environmental, Health, and Safety ("EHS") requirements. We utilize a common safety standard identified within our EHS Lean Assessment highlighting expectations surrounding management commitment, employee engagement, metrics, regulatory compliance and hazard control. 
We monitor and track health and safety data, including employee injuries, environmental releases and regulatory inspections. Additionally, we assess the EHS maturity of our locations by measuring progress against nVent's EHS Lean Assessment and Standards and region specific regulatory compliance evaluations, as well as nVent's employee driven risk notification program. Results are reviewed monthly to reduce recordable injury rates and to drive improvement within our EHS programs. Globally, we have adopted guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) in the United States to determine recordable injuries. 
We believe we have achieved a strong safety track record through employee engagement and proactive risk management.
