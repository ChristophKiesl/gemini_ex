ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Unless we have indicated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “MassRoots,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” or similar terms are to MassRoots, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated, all share and per share information relating to our common stock in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the “Exchange” which occurred during our “Reorganization”. See the section entitled “Fundraising During the Year and Our Reorganization” contained in this “Item 1” for additional discussion of the Exchange and Reorganization.
 
Organization
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry.
 
On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Whaxy Merger”), whereby we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of DDDigtal Inc (“DDDigtal”), a Colorado corporation. Upon consummation of the Whaxy Merger, each share of DDDigtal’s common stock was exchanged for a number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof), based on an exchange ratio, as ultimately calculated, equal to approximately 5.273-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 5.273 shares of DDDigtal’s common stock. At the same time, all shares of common stock of our merger subsidiary, created solely for the purpose of effectuating the Whaxy Merger, was converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of DDDigtal, and all shares of DDDigtal’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Whaxy Merger automatically cancelled and retired. DDDigtal continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary (“Whaxy”), and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist. In connection with the Whaxy Merger, each stockholder of DDDigtal prior to such merger entered into a lock-up agreement with us, thereby prohibiting each such stockholder from offering, selling, contracting to sell, pledging, giving, donating, transferring or otherwise disposing of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock obtained pursuant to the Whaxy Merger for a period of six (6) months following the effective date of such merger, which was January 25, 2017.
 
Our principal executive office is located at MassRoots, Inc., 1624 Market Street, Suite 201, Denver, CO 80202, and our telephone number is (720) 442-0052.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we raised an aggregate of $6,158,770 from the sale of our securities (including the exercise of previously issued warrants for the purchase of our common stock). For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $18,030,124.
 
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for our Company, which includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies.
 
Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.

We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1 billion, as adjusted, or more, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
Background 
 
MassRoots was formed in April 2013 as a technology platform for the medical cannabis community. In July 2013, we launched in the App Store and since that time, have grown into a community of more than 1,000,000 cannabis consumers. Our platform enables medical cannabis patients to review strains and products based on their effect, for example, being effective at treating back-pain or nausea. We then present this information in easy-to-use, actionable formats for everyday cannabis consumers to make purchasing decisions. Our growth has been primarily driven by MassRoots’ increasing popularity as one of the first national cannabis brands and word of mouth virility from our Users.
 
As a technology company, MassRoots is able to rapidly scale its products and services with minimal marginal costs – each additional User or business that we add to our platform only costs negligible server hosting fees. It also allows us to have exposure to every regulated cannabis market without establishing a physical presence in each state. This minimizes the costs of scaling and required capital while, at the same time, offering a direct role in the cannabis industry without ever touching the plant itself.
 
MassRoots has strong relationships in both the technology and cannabis industries. As a semi-finalist for the Extreme Tech Challenge, MassRoots was introduced to some of the leading technology investors and developers in Silicon Valley and became one of the first cannabis-related companies to present on stage at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in early 2016. At the same time, MassRoots raised much of its seed-stage capital from the ArcView Group, the largest network of cannabis investors and businesses in the industry, enabling the Company to develop relationships with the key plays in the cannabis sector.
 
Definitions of Key Metrics
 
Total users (“Users”) is defined as every user who currently has an account with MassRoots. It does not include users who have deleted their account. It does not reflect active usage over any set period of time.
 
User interactions (“Interactions”) is defined as anytime a User follows another User, posts a status, comments on a status, or likes a status.
 
Our Products and Services
 
Our technology platform consists of: our consumer-facing social network (accessible through our Android application, iOS application, and web portal) and our business-facing advertising portal, MassRoots for Business.
The MassRoots Network
 
The MassRoots network is accessible as a free mobile application through the iOS App Store, the Amazon App Store, the Google Play Marketplace, and as a website at www.MassRoots.com. These applications and services work in a similar manner as other social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Vine:

• | Users may create a profile by choosing a username, setting their password and agreeing to our Terms and Conditions. We do not require Users’ real names or phone numbers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


• | | Users have the ability to follow other Users on the network. By “following” an account, Users are essentially “opting-in” to their posts, allowing them to be displayed on their newsfeed. 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | Users have the ability to reviews strains and products based on their quality and other factors. These reviews are then displayed on product pages within the app and on the users’ profile. 
• | | Users’ newsfeed displays all the posts from Users in which they follow in reverse-chronological order, with the most recent posts being at the top. A Users’ profile page displays all the posts from that particular Users. 
• | | Users have the ability to like, comment and report statuses from other Users. By “liking” a status, a User is indicating their approval of the post’s content. By commenting on a status, Users are free to voice their opinions or comments on the post’s content. By reporting a status, Users can flag content that violates our Terms and Conditions, including spam and harassing content. 
• | | Users have the ability to tag other Users and use hashtags to categorize posts. By using the “@” symbol followed by a username, Users can tag other Users in posts they want them to see or if they are included in the picture or post. By using the “#” followed by a categorical word, Users can categorize posts based on their content. 
• | | Users have the ability to post pictures with text captions or just text statuses. 
• | | Users have the ability to search for Users based on their username and the ability to search by hashtag to display all results within a particular category. Users can sort hashtag searches by their popularity or when they were posted. 
• | | Users have the ability to set their profile to public and private. By setting their profile to public, any User on MassRoots’ apps will be able to see the public profile’s posts and follow the account. When a profile is private, another User must request to follow their account and the account owner must grant permission before they can view any of the account’s posts. 

Integration with Dispensary Point of Sale Systems
 
During the third quarter of 2016, we began integrating MassRoots with dispensary point of sale systems, enabling businesses to target advertising to Users based on their purchasing history. For example, if a particular User goes to a dispensary every week for a month and purchases a chocolate brownie edible and then does not come back for two weeks, the dispensary would be able to send them a targeted ad offering them 20% off their next chocolate brownie edible purchase. The dispensary would be able to control the advertising offer, the targeting options, and all other relevant information. This will enable cannabis-related businesses to use data to target advertising directly to the consumers most likely to take action based on them, very similar to other social networks.
 
To facilitate this integration with dispensary point of sale systems, during the second quarter of 2015, MassRoots invested $175,000 in exchange for preferred shares of Flowhub LLC (“Flowhub”), a seed-to-sale system, equal to 8.95% of the then outstanding equity of Flowhub. Since that time, we have been working with Flowhub to integrate their system with our network. We believe that Flowhub has developed the “next generation” of seed-to-sale software and believe there is tremendous amount of synergies between the data both MassRoots and Flowhub collect. We believe that by consolidating data from such cannabis point of sale systems, grow operations, and our consumer-facing social network, we will have some of the most important data available in the cannabis industry.
 
On January 25, 2017, pursuant to the Whaxy Merger, we acquired DDDigtal and its menu management and online ordering platform for licensed cannabis businesses, known as “Whaxy”. Prior to the acquisition, Whaxy had processed over $5 million in volume across 40,000 unique transactions. The acquisition of Whaxy expands our offerings to include a full suite of dispensary software solutions – online ordering, marketing, and real-time inventory management— for cannabis businesses. Additionally, the Company retained Zach Marburger and Micah Davidson, Whaxy’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, respectively, as part of the MassRoots team.
 
User Growth and Product Distribution Channels
 
The MassRoots app is distributed free of charge through the iOS App Store, the Google Play Marketplace and the Amazon App Store. Prospective users can search for MassRoots on these platforms, read user-reviews and make a decision on whether to download and utilize the MassRoots app. The MassRoots network is also accessible through desktop and mobile web browsers by navigating to www.MassRoots.com. Our MassRoots for Business portal is distributed at MassRoots.com/business where companies may request access.

MassRoots has primarily gained Users through organic growth - Users telling their friends to join the network. This is supported by the number of endorsements MassRoots receives on Instagram and Twitter, viewable by searching “#MassRoots”.
 
App/Play Store Issues, User Support and Similar Matters
 
On November 4, 2014, the MassRoots App was removed from Apple’s iOS App Store due to what we originally believed was a compliance issue with the App Store review team. Existing iOS Users were still able to access and use the MassRoots App; however, new Users were prohibited from downloading it. We discovered that this was a result of the App Store review team changing their app enforcement guidelines to prohibit all social cannabis applications.
 
When we learned of the true nature of this policy change, we began organizing the cannabis community and industry against it. In early January 2015, we co-signed a letter to Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, along with several cannabis business leaders, arguing that the App Store’s policies were stifling innovation in the cannabis industry. Over 10,000 of our Users sent personal emails to Apple advocating why MassRoots should return to the App Store - with their arguments ranging from freedom of speech and expression to cannabis patients suffering from anxiety who need social support networks.
 
In early February 2015, an App Store representative informed us Apple had revised its enforcement guidelines - social cannabis applications that were geo-restricted to the 23 states with medical cannabis laws were once again permitted. On February 12, 2015, MassRoots returned to the App Store after we implemented the geo-restrictions.
 
While we are grateful to Apple for reversing its decision, we cannot guarantee this policy will remain in place. The iOS App Store is one of the largest content distribution channels in the world and is the only way to effectively distribute software to the large percentage of the United States population who own iPhones and iPads. The iOS App Store review team is essentially a regulator for our product - they decide what rules all applications in the iOS App Store must operate by and how to enforce those regulations. The rules related to cannabis-related apps are not published, enforcement of those rules is difficult to predict, and the App review and appeal processes are conducted in secret without public oversight. MassRoots will continue to push for a more open and transparent app review process - especially when such policies and decisions directly impact a large portion of the population - but there is no guarantee we will be successful in those efforts.
 
MassRoots, along with most other cannabis apps, regularly encounter issues with the Google Play Store review team in the normal course of business due to Google Play Store’s absence of clear rules and guidelines regarding cannabis-related apps. On November 18, 2016, the MassRoots App was removed from the Google Play Store due to a compliance review. On March 21, 2017, Google Play approved the MassRoots App for distribution to Android devices through the Google Play Store once again.
 
On December 1, 2016, MassRoots’ Android application received approval from the Amazon App Store for listing, and is presently available for download on the Amazon App Store.
 
Under their respective developer license agreements, Apple, Inc., Google, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. have the right to update their iOS App Store, Play Store and Amazon App Store policies, respectfully, to prohibit cannabis-related applications at any time. This could result in many prospective users being unable to access and join our network and existing Users being unable to access our App.
 
Our activities outside of the application stores have also faced backlash and resistance due to our status as a cannabis-related company. For example, our Instagram account has a wide following of over 435,000 followers, one of the most of any cannabis related company, and we utilize this following to help expand our user-base. However, in a situation similar to the iOS App Store removal, our Instagram account (along with several other cannabis related accounts) was suspended in January 2016 without notice or explanation from Instagram. The account was later reinstated on February 26, 2016. While we feel that our platform is at the point where any potential suspension will not affect our User growth, we expect to continue to face similar situations in the future that may cause disruptions, if only temporary, to our business plan.

Market Conditions
 
MassRoots is poised to take advantage of two rapidly growing industries: cannabis and mobile technology.
 
Cannabis Market Growth and Current Trends
 
Since the MassRoots app first launched in July 2013, there have been a series of events that have help further shape the development of the cannabis and mobile technology industries:
 
On August 29, 2013, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo (“The Cole Memo”) in response to certain states passing measures to legalize the medical and adult-use of cannabis. The Cole Memo does not alter the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law, but does recommend that U.S. Attorneys to focus their time and resources on certain priorities, rather than businesses legally operating under state law. These guidelines focus on ensuring that cannabis does not cross state lines, keeping dispensaries away from schools and public facilities, and strict-enforcement of state laws by regulatory agencies, among other priorities.
 
On January 1, 2014, the first sales of cannabis for adult-use permissible under state law took place in Colorado. This event resulted in significant media coverage for the industry. Since that time, three other states and the District of Columbia have made adult-use permissible under their state law and several states have ballot proposals pending at upcoming elections.
 
On February 14, 2014, the Departments of Justice and Treasury issued a joint memo allowing banks and financial institutions to accept deposits from dispensaries operating legally under state law. In most cases, dispensaries had been forced to operate on a cash basis, presenting significant security and accounting issues. This was a major step in legitimizing and accepting the cannabis industry on a national level. Further, the passing of the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment (as defined below) in 2014 and 2015 indicates some level of support in Congress for medicinal cannabis, even if its actual effect is still undetermined.
 
For additional information concerning the Cole Memo, Rohrabacher Farr Amendment and regulatory conditions, see the section entitled “Business – Government Regulation.”
 
Current States With Laws Permitting the Medical or Adult Use of Cannabis
 
As of December 31, 2016, 28 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of cannabis, while eight of those states and the District of Columbia have also legalized the adult-use of cannabis. The states which have enacted such laws are listed below:

28. Vermont | 2004 
29. Washington* | 1998 

 
* State has enacted laws permitting the adult use of cannabis, in addition to medical use.
 
Public Support for Legalization Increasing
 
A Quinnipiac poll conducted in February 2017 found that 93% of the American people supported legalizing the medicinal use of cannabis, 59% supported legalizing the adult-use of cannabis, and 77% of Americans were opposed to federal government interference with state marijuana programs.
 
A 2017 ArcView Market Research report predicts an additional 14 states will legalize the adult-use of cannabis and two states will legalize medical-use within the next five years. If public support for cannabis legalization continues to increase, we believe it is likely that Federal policies towards marijuana will be reformed. The combination of additional states legalizing adult-use under state law, expansion of medical-use provisions in states where it is currently permitted under state law and increased public awareness is projected to cause marijuana sales permitted under state law to grow from $1.43 billion in 2013 to $10.2 billion in 2018, according to ArcView Market Research.

Market Conditions that Could Limit Our Business
 
Cannabis is a Schedule I Controlled Substance under Federal law and, as such, there are several factors that could limit our market and our business. They include, but are not limited to:

• | The Federal government and many private employers prohibit drug use of any kind, including cannabis, even where it is permissible under state law. Random drug screenings and potential enforcement of these employment provisions significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Enforcement of Federal law prohibiting cannabis occurs randomly and often without notice. This could scare many potential investors away from cannabis-related investments and makes it difficult to make accurate market predictions; 
• | There is no guarantee that additional states will pass measures to legalize cannabis under state law. In many states, public support of legalization initiatives is within the margin of error of pass or fail. This is especially true when a supermajority is needed to pass measures, like in Florida where a state constitutional amendment permitting medical cannabis has been proposed, but requires 60% approval to pass. Changes in voters’ attitudes and turnout have the potential to slow or stop the cannabis legalization movement and potentially reverse recent cannabis legalization victories; 
• | There has been some resistance and negativity as a result of recent cannabis legalization at the state level, especially as it relates to drugged driving. The lack of clearly defined and enforced laws at the state level has the potential to sway public opinion against marijuana legalization; and 
• | Even if the Federal government does not enforce the Federal law prohibiting cannabis, the legality of the state laws regarding the legalization of cannabis are being challenged through lawsuits. Oklahoma and Nebraska recently sued Colorado over the legalization of cannabis, and other lawsuits have been brought by private groups and local law enforcement officials. If these lawsuits are successful, state laws permitting cannabis sales may be overturned and significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market and affect our business. 

 
Additional discussion of government regulations is available in the “Government Regulation” section below.
 
Fundraising and Previous Offerings
 
Since our inception, we have spent considerable effort on fundraising to support the operations of the Company.
 
In connection with an offering that occurred in October 2013, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which authorized the issuance of 21 shares of preferred stock (6,397,958 common shares post-Exchange, as defined below) with a par value of $1.00 per share, 17.65 shares (5,377,332 common shares post-Exchange) of which were designated as Series A Preferred Stock. Among other rights and privileges, holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend of 7% annually, preferential payments over common stock in liquidation and other events, and the ability to convert their Series A Preferred Stock to common stock on a one to one basis (taking into account any unpaid dividends).
 
In October 2013, the Company entered into agreements to issue 5.88, 5.88, and 5.89 Series A Preferred shares (1,791,428, 1,791,428, and 1,791,475 common shares post-Exchange) to Bass Point Capital, LLC, WM18 Finance LTD, and Rother Investments, LLC, respectively, in exchange for a $50,000 investment from each. In addition, the Company entered into an agreement to issue as compensation for services provided a total of 2.94 Series A Preferred shares (895,715 common shares post-Exchange) to Douglas Leighton for financial consulting services (collectively, the “Original Offering”).
 
The Reorganization and Exchange
 
In preparation for the March 2014 Offering (as defined herein) and the Company’s intention of becoming a publicly traded entity, on March 18, 2014 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with its shareholders in which the following was effected: (i) on March 21, 2014, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was amended to allow for the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and amended the par value of the Company’s common stock to $0.001 per share; (ii) on March 24, 2014, each of the Company’s preferred shareholders converted their shares into common stock on a one for one basis (including the accrued divided); and (iii) on March 24, 2014, each of the Company’s shareholders surrendered their shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for the pro-rata distribution of 36,000,000 newly issued shares of Company’s common stock, based on the percentage of the total shares of common stock held by the shareholder immediately prior to the exchange (the “Exchange”).

The March 2014 Offering and Registration Rights
 
In March 2014, we raised gross proceeds of $475,000 through an offering of our securities to certain accredited and non-accredited investors consisting of: (i) $269,100 face amount of convertible debentures convertible into up to 2,691,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.10 per share (the “2014 Debentures”), together with warrants, exercisable into an amount of our common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the common stock underlying the 2014 Debentures, at $0.40 per share (the “2014 Debenture Warrants”); and (ii) 2,059,000 shares of our common stock at $0.10 per share with a warrant, exercisable into an amount of our common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the common stock purchased, at $0.40 per share (the “2014 Common Stock Warrants”) (collectively, the “March 2014 Offering”). Five investors received 2014 Debentures and 2014 Debenture Warrants, while 36 accredited and unaccredited investors received the common stock and 2014 Common Stock Warrants. In July 2015, one investor exchanged 1,000,000 shares of our common stock for a warrant exercisable into 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share, with materially the same terms as the $0.001 Consulting Warrants (as defined below).
 
In connection with the March 2014 Offering, we entered into certain registration rights agreements (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), whereby we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC within forty-five (45) days after March 24, 2014, covering all outstanding shares of common stock (including all shares of common stock sold in the March 2014 Offering), in addition to all shares of common stock underlying the 2014 Debentures, 2014 Debenture Warrants, and 2014 Common Stock Warrants.
 
Additionally, as payment for consulting services provided in relation to the March 2014 Offering, we issued Dutchess Opportunity Fund, II LP (“Dutchess”) a warrant exercisable into 4,050,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share, and a warrant exercisable into 2,375,000 shares of our common stock at $0.40 per share. The Company also granted certain registration rights to Dutchess covering all shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of each of the warrants it received in connection to the March 2014 Offering. As of December 31, 2016, all such warrants issued as payment for consulting services had been exercised.
 
On September 15, 2014, our resale registration statement on Form S-1 covering 50,400,000 shares of common stock outstanding or shares of common stock underlying warrants or debentures received in connection to the March 2014 Offering (“2014 Registration Statement”) became effective.
 
In March 2016, holders of the 2014 Debentures agreed to revise the maturity date of the 2014 Debentures from March 24, 2016 to March 24, 2018.
 
Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, holders of the 2014 Debenture Warrants and 2014 Common Stock Warrants exercised such warrants into 1,809,011 shares of the Company’s common stock, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $723,604.
 
Additional Offerings / Private Placements
 
From September 15, 2014 to March 11, 2015, we completed an offering of $861,000 of our securities to certain accredited and non-accredited investors consisting of 1,732,000 shares of our common stock at $0.50 per share and warrants to purchase up to 866,000 shares of common stock at $1 per share.
 
From April 1, 2015 through April 17, 2015, we completed an offering of 960,337 shares of the Company’s common stock to certain accredited and unaccredited investors, pursuant to which, the Company received gross proceeds of $576,200. The Company terminated this offering as of April 17, 2015. The Company compensated Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, its placement agent for the offering, $20,000 in cash and 262,560 shares of common stock as commission for this placement.
 
From June 10, 2015 through July 13, 2015, we sold 1,540,672 shares of unregistered common stock to certain accredited investors for gross proceeds of $1,140,502. In connection with this offering, Chardan Capital Markets LLC, its placement agent for the offering, received $27,200 in cash and 80,560 shares of the Company’s common stock as commission for this placement.

On November 9, 2015, we sold 815,500 shares of common stock, with warrants to purchase 407,475 shares of common stock, in a registered offering to certain unaccredited and accredited investors for gross proceeds of $1,019,375 to the Company. We did not utilize a placement agent in this transaction. 
 
In December 2015, we issued 146,200 three year warrants with an exercise price of $1.06 to our holders of outstanding warrants issued in conjunction with our September 15, 2014 to March 11, 2015 offering. These warrants were issued in exchange for the holder agreeing to waive certain provisions providing price protection of the warrant received in the September 15, 2014 to March 11, 2015 offering. 
 
The March 2016 Note Offering
 
In March 2016, we completed a private offering (“March 2016 Note Offering”) to certain accredited investors of six (6) month secured convertible notes with a principal amount of $1,514,669 (the “Bridge Notes”) together with five year warrants to purchase an amount of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Bridge Notes in full and having an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The Bridge Notes were secured by all the assets of the Company, and each of the executive officers of the Company entered into a lock-up agreement whereby they agreed to not sell or offer any shares of the Company’s common stock owned by them until the Bridge Notes were fully repaid, redeemed or converted. The Bridge Notes were convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share equal to the lower of (i) one dollar ($1.00), and (ii) a 25% discount to the price at which the Company next conducts an offering after the issuance date of the Bridge Note; provided, however, if any part of the principal amount of the Bridge Note remains unpaid at its maturity date, the conversion price would be equal to 65% of the average of the three trading days with the lowest daily weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock occurring during the fifteen days prior to the Bridge Note’s maturity date.
 
On September 14, 2016, upon maturity of the Bridge Notes, the Company was unable to make the required payment of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of $966,384 and was in default under the Bridge Notes. Because the Bridge Notes were not repaid by the maturity date, the investors became entitled to receive, in aggregate, but calculated pro rata to the principal amounts remaining outstanding at the time of maturity, up to five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of the Company’s common stock. Gross proceeds received by the Company for the Bridge Notes and warrants in the March 2016 Note Offering were $1,420,000, while net proceeds were $1,271,600 (excluding any legal fees). In connection with the March 2016 Note Offering, Chardan Capital Markets LLC, our placement agent for the offering, received $123,400 in cash as commission for this placement.
 
On October 7, 2016, the Company announced that the Company had completed the repayment to the holders of all outstanding principal and other amounts due pursuant to the March 2016 Note Offering. In total, the Company made payment to the holders of (i) an aggregate of $1,479,298 in cash and (ii) pursuant to the right of conversion of the notes, issued an aggregate of 2,377,861 shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 65% of the average of the three trading days with the lowest daily weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock occurring during the fifteen days prior to September 14, 2016. The Company believes that it has completed all of its obligations under the Bridge Notes and is no longer in default under the Bridge Notes or any related agreements. The Bridge Notes are now retired.
 
Our 2016 Direct Registered Offering
 
From August 12, 2016 to October 21, 2016, Company completed it registered direct offering to certain investors pursuant to which we raised an aggregate in $5,000,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company’s common stock, together with warrants, with one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price equal to $0.90 per share (the “2016 Direct Registered Offering”). The purchase price paid by investors was $0.50 for one share of common stock and one warrant. The warrants are immediately exercisable and expire three years from the date of issuance. The shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable and are issued separately. This offering was closed on October 21, 2016. A total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock were sold in the offering and have been or will be issued pursuant to the Prospectus dated August 12, 2016, as amended on August 19, 2016 and October 5, 2016.

NASDAQ Application and Withdrawal 
 
On August 20, 2015, we applied to have our common stock listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”). In connection to this application, we also received approval from our shareholders to effect a reverse stock split in order to meet the initial listing requirements of NASDAQ.
 
While we believe the Company would meet the NASDAQ listing requirements, on May 23, 2016, the Company received preliminary notice that its application for listing had been denied. While not confirmed in writing by NASDAQ, the Company believes that this preliminary denial was at least partially related to the cannabis-related nature of our business. On June 7, 2016, the Company formally withdrew its application to list on NASDAQ and reaffirmed its focus on its core business. The Company will continue to evaluate the potential for filing a new application with NASDAQ or other securities exchange going forward; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will ever decide to file a new application, or, even if a new application is filed, that the Company will ever be successful in having its shares listed on a securities exchange.
 
Employees and Consultants
 
MassRoots has 31 full-time employees, two part time employees, and one full time independent contractor.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. However, 28 states and the District of Columbia have passed state laws that permit doctors to prescribe cannabis for medical-use and eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that legalize the adult-use of cannabis for any reason. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that legally operate under certain state laws but in violation of Federal law.
Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under certain state laws, so long as:

• | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
• | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
• | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
• | there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
• | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
• | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 

 
The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. We believe we have implemented procedures and policies to ensure we are operating in compliance with the “Cole Memo”. However, we cannot provide assurance that our actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations. Per MassRoots’ Terms and Conditions:
 

• | Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is legal; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Users must be of legal age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state); 
• | Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state’s laws; 
• | Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through MassRoots unless they are a licensed dispensary (we also do not currently facilitate in-app messaging, forcing all conversations to take place in a public environment); 
• | Posting of any other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills, is prohibited and will result in account termination; 
• | Posting of any violence or threat of violence is prohibited and will result in account termination; 
• | Posting of any drugged-driving content is prohibited and will result in account termination; and 
• | Posting of any copyright-protected content is prohibited and will result in account termination.

We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions. Users have the ability to report any status or account that is in violation of our terms and we encourage Users to do so as any illegal content jeopardizes the network for all our Users. When a status or account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the network until further review. A MassRoots employee then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as within our Terms and Conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the User account.
 
In addition, as part of the agreement to allow our app to return to the Apple App Store, we implemented restrictions to restrict new Users to our mobile apps to the 28 states with medical cannabis laws.
 
Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our network which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo. However, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
Rohrabacher Farr Amendment
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision known as the “Rohrabacher Farr Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015 and remains in effect currently.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws – and has continued to sporadically commence enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being legal under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice’s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what the interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
Potential Changes to Federal Laws and Enforcement Priorities
 
Although the Department of Justice has stated in the Cole Memo that it is not an efficient use of limited resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis, there is no guarantee that the Department of Justice’s position will not change regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. However, the United State Department of Justice is now under new leadership following the 2016 election. The new administration could introduce a less favorable cannabis enforcement policy. To date, the new administration has not affirmed or altered the policies outlined in the Cole Memo. There can be no assurances that the new administration or any future administration would not change the current enforcement policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws.
 
In light of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Gonzales v. Raich, under the commerce clause of the constitution, Congress may pass laws to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states have approved its use for medicinal purposes, which leads to the conclusion that the Controlled Substances Act may preempt state laws relating to any cannabis-related activity. Any such change in the federal enforcement program of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business. While we do not directly harvest or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.

Trademarks
 
On March 31, 2014, we applied for a trademark of the “MassRoots, Inc.” name in the United States. However, several factors, including the Company’s app being removed from Apple’s iOS App Store, required the Company to focus its resources in other areas, away from completing the trademark application process, and the trademark application was deemed to be abandoned. The Company reapplied for this trademark in 2016, and is currently responding to staff comments on its application.
Competitors, Methods of Completion, Competitive Business Conditions
 
MassRoots competes with cannabis information platforms such as WeedMaps and Leafly. All of these services and MassRoots provide information on dispensary locations, strain information, and news relating to the cannabis industry. MassRoots’ primary competitive advantage is the social aspects of our platform – Users have profiles, build an online personality and preferences, and follow other Users with similar interests.
 
Network effects have come to dominate consumer habits, which can provide protection to networks such as MassRoots. For example, Google+ failed to obtain a dominant market share in desktop-based social networking because it wasn’t introduced until Facebook had already conquered the market. Similarly, when Facebook introduced Poke as a competitor to SnapChat in late 2012, it failed to overtake SnapChat due to the market dominance already achieved by SnapChat. Even if a well-financed competitor to MassRoots were to emerge, they would not only have to convince Users on why their platform is superior, but also get them to switch away from the network their friends are already using. Every User that MassRoots gains, every interaction that takes place on our network and every day that we grow, the barrier to entry to competitors becomes higher.
