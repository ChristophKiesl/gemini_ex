Item 1. BUSINESS
General
M/I Homes, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the nation’s leading builders of single-family homes. The Company commenced homebuilding activities in 1976. Since that time, the Company has sold over 127,650 homes. Unless this Form 10-K otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to M/I Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company consists of two distinct operations: homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations are aggregated for reporting purposes into two reporting segments - the Northern and Southern regions. Our financial services operations support our homebuilding operations by providing mortgage loans and title services to the customers of our homebuilding operations and are reported as an independent segment.
Our homebuilding operations comprise the most significant portion of our business, representing 97% of consolidated revenue in 2020 and 98% in 2019. We design, market, construct and sell single-family homes and attached townhomes to first-time, move-up, empty-nester, and luxury buyers. In addition to home sales, our homebuilding operations generate revenue from the sale of land and lots. We use the term “home” to refer to a single-family residence, whether it is a single-family home or attached home. We use the term “community” to refer to a single development in which we construct homes, or, at times, “multiple communities” can exist in a single development where we offer multiple product types. We primarily construct homes in planned development communities and mixed-use communities. We are currently offering homes for sale in 202 communities within 15 markets located in ten states. Our average sales price of homes delivered during 2020 was $381,000, and the average sales price of our homes in backlog at December 31, 2020 was $419,000. We offer homes ranging from a base sales price of approximately $200,000 to $1,045,000 and believe that this range of price points allows us to appeal to and attract a wide range of buyers. We believe that we distinguish ourselves from competitors by offering homes in select areas with a high level of design and construction quality, providing superior customer service and offering mortgage and title services to fully serve our customers. In our experience, our product offerings and customer service make the homebuying process more efficient for our customers.
Our financial services operations generate revenue primarily from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance and closing services. We offer mortgage banking services to our homebuyers through our 100%-owned subsidiary, M/I Financial, LLC (“M/I Financial”). We offer title services through subsidiaries that are 100%-owned by the Company. Our financial services operations accounted for 3% of our consolidated revenues in 2020 and 2% in 2019. See the “Financial Services” section below for additional information regarding our financial services operations.
Our principal executive offices are located at 4131 Worth Avenue, Suite 500, Columbus, Ohio 43219. The telephone number of our corporate headquarters is (614) 418-8000 and our website address is www.mihomes.com. Information on our website is not a part of and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.
Markets
For reporting purposes, our 15 homebuilding divisions are aggregated into the following two segments:

Region | Market/Division | Year Operations Commenced
Northern | Columbus, Ohio | 1976 
Northern | Cincinnati, Ohio | 1988 
Northern | Indianapolis, Indiana | 1988 
Northern | Chicago, Illinois | 2007 
Northern | Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota | 2015 
Northern | Detroit, Michigan | 2018 
Southern | Tampa, Florida | 1981 
Southern | Orlando, Florida | 1984 
Southern | Sarasota, Florida | 2016 
Southern | Charlotte, North Carolina | 1985 
Southern | Raleigh, North Carolina | 1986 
Southern | Houston, Texas | 2010 
Southern | San Antonio, Texas | 2011 
Southern | Austin, Texas | 2012 
Southern | Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas | 2013 

We believe we have experienced management teams in each of our divisions with local market expertise. Our business requires in-depth knowledge of local markets to acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms, engage subcontractors, plan communities that meet local demand, anticipate consumer tastes in specific markets, and assess local regulatory environments. Although we centralize certain functions (such as accounting, human resources, legal, land purchase approval, and risk management) to benefit from economies of scale, our local management, generally under the direction of an Area President and supervised by a Region President, exercises considerable autonomy in identifying land acquisition opportunities, developing and implementing product and sales strategies, and controlling costs.
Industry Overview and Current Market Conditions
Following a substantial decline in new contracts in the latter half of March and April as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a sharp recovery and an increase in sales activity commencing in May as pandemic-related restrictions began to ease. This trend of increasing sales volume continued through our third and fourth quarters, resulting in the Company achieving a record for new contracts in 2020, along with records in a number of other operating and financial metrics. We believe that the homebuilding industry benefited from record-low interest rates, a continued undersupply of available homes and a desire of many consumers to move from rental apartments and densely populated areas to single family homes in suburban locations. We believe these factors will continue to support demand into 2021, subject to the economic uncertainties caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Company-wide, our absorption pace of sales per community in 2020 improved to 3.7 per month compared to 2.6 per month in 2019. Our average sales price in backlog increased in 2020 by 6%. Partially as a result of this accelerated sales pace, we sold out of some communities earlier and our number of active communities declined to 202 at the end of 2020 from 225 at the end of 2019. We continued to place additional land under contract for communities that will be brought online in future periods, and controlled approximately 39,500 lots at December 31, 2020. Our ability to timely replace existing communities could further impact our number of active communities. We continue to work to open new communities, and we are also actively managing sales pace, in part by selectively increasing prices, to better match our availability of lots and production schedule.
Business Strategy
We remain focused on increasing our profitability by generating additional revenue, continuing to expand our market share, shifting our product mix to include more affordable designs, and investing in attractive land opportunities to increase our 
number of active communities. Consistent with our focus on improving long-term financial results, we expect to continue to emphasize the following strategic business objectives in 2021:
•managing our land spend and inventory levels;
•accelerating the opening of new communities wherever possible;
•maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity levels;
•expanding the availability of our more affordable Smart Series homes; and
•emphasizing customer service, product quality and design, and premier locations.
However, we can provide no assurance that the positive trends reflected in our financial and operating metrics in 2019 and 2020 will continue in 2021, especially given the uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the timing and extent of the associated decline in economic activity and subsequent recovery.
Sales and Marketing
During 2020, we continued to focus our marketing efforts on first-time and move-up homebuyers, including home designs targeted to first-time, millennial and empty-nester homebuyers. We market and sell our homes primarily under the M/I Homes brand. Our marketing efforts are directed at driving interest in and preference for the M/I Homes brand over other homebuilders or the resale market.
We provide our homebuyers with the following products, programs and services which we believe differentiate our brand: (1) homes with high quality construction located in attractive areas and desirable communities that are supported by our transferable structural warranty, which is a 15-year warranty in all of our markets other than Texas and a 10-year warranty in our Texas markets; (2) our Whole Home Building Standards which are designed to deliver features and benefits that satisfy the buyer’s expectation for a better-built home, including a more eco-friendly and energy efficient home that we believe will generally save our customers up to 30% on their energy costs compared to a home that is built to minimum code requirements; (3) our Design Studios and Design Consultants that assist our homebuyers in selecting product and design options; (4) fully furnished model homes and highly-trained sales consultants to build the buyer’s confidence and enhance the quality of the homebuying experience; (5) our mortgage financing programs that we offer through M/I Financial, including competitive fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans; (6) our Ready Now Homes program which offers homebuyers the opportunity to close on certain new homes in 60 days or less; and (7) our unwavering focus on customer care and customer satisfaction.
By offering Whole Home Energy-Efficient Homes to our customers, we enable our homebuyers to save on their energy costs (the second largest cost of home ownership) compared to a home that is built to minimum code requirements. We use independent RESNET-Certified Raters and the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) Index, the national standard for energy efficiency, to measure the performance of our homes, including insulation, ventilation, air tightness, and the heating and cooling system. Our divisions’ average scores are generally lower (and, therefore, better) than the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star target standard of 72-75 or the average score for a resale home (130 or higher).
To further enhance the homebuying process, we operate Design Studios in a majority of our markets. Our Design Studios allow our homebuyers to select from a variety of product and design options that are available for purchase as part of the original construction of their homes. Our centers are staffed with Design Consultants who help our homebuyers select the right combination of options to meet their budget, lifestyle and design sensibilities. In most of our markets, we offer our homebuyers the option to consider and make design planning decisions using our Envision online design tool. We believe this tool is helpful for prospective buyers to use during the planning phase and makes their actual visit to our Design Studios more productive and efficient as our consultants are able to view the buyer’s preliminary design selections and pull samples in advance of the buyer’s visit. 
We also invest in designing and decorating fully-furnished and distinctive model homes intended to create an atmosphere reflecting how people live today and help our customers imagine the possibilities for a “home of their own, just the way they dreamed it.” We carefully select the interior decorating and design of our model homes to reflect the lifestyles of our prospective buyers. We believe these models showcase our homes at their maximum livability and potential and provide ideas and inspiration for our customers to incorporate valuable design options into their new home.
Our company-employed sales consultants are trained and prepared to meet the buyer’s expectations and build the buyer’s confidence by fully explaining the features and benefits of our homes, helping each buyer determine which home best suits the buyer’s needs, explaining the construction process, and assisting the buyer in choosing the best financing option. We give significant attention to the ongoing training of all sales personnel to assure a high level of professionalism and product knowledge. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 257 home sales consultants.
We also offer specialized mortgage financing programs through M/I Financial to assist our homebuyers. We offer conventional financing options along with programs offered by the Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”), U.S. Veterans Administration (“VA”), United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and state housing bond agencies. M/I Financial offers our homebuyers “one-stop” shopping by providing mortgage and title services for the purchase of their home, which we believe saves our customers both time and money. By working with many of the major mortgage providers in the country, we seek to offer our homebuyers unique programs with below-market financing options that are more competitive than what homebuyers could obtain on their own. With respect to title services, the Company’s title subsidiaries work closely with our homebuilding divisions so that we are able to provide an organized and efficient home delivery process.
We also build inventory homes in most of our communities to offer homebuyers the opportunity to close on certain new homes in 60 days or less. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who require a home delivery within a short time frame and allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market. We determine our inventory homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of inventory homes in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust inventory homes on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant.
We seek to keep our homebuyers actively involved in the construction of their new home, providing them with continued communication throughout the design and construction process. Our goal is to put the buyer first and enhance the total homebuying experience. We believe prompt and courteous responses to homebuyers’ needs throughout the homebuying process reduce post-delivery repair costs, enhance our reputation for quality and service, and encourage repeat and referral business from homebuyers and the real estate community.
Finally, we believe our ultimate differentiator comes from the principles our company was founded upon -- integrity and delivering superior customer service and a quality product. Our customer satisfaction scores are measured by an independent third-party company at both 30 days and 6 months after delivery to hold us accountable for building a home of the highest quality. 
We market our homes using digital and traditional media. The particular media used differs from market to market based on area demographics and other competitive factors. We market directly to consumers via newspaper, direct mail, billboards, radio, and television as well as internet marketing using our website, search engine optimization, paid search, and display advertising. We leverage our presence on referral sites, such as Zillow.com and NewHomeSource.com, to drive sales leads to our internet sales associates. We also use email marketing to maintain communication with existing prospects and customers. We use our social media presence to communicate to potential homebuyers the experiences of customers who have purchased our homes and to provide content about our homes and design features.
In response to the changing needs of consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we made several adjustments to our sales and marketing strategy. First, we encouraged consumers to shop for a new home from the comfort of their existing home by mailing a free VR Headset to them upon request. Each of our home plans was professionally scanned in 3D, creating an immersive Virtual Tour experience. Second, as many consumers expressed discomfort visiting public spaces, we began offering Virtual Appointments. This enabled our New Home Sales Consultants to provide a live home tour while engaging in personalized selling conversation. Finally, we launched flexABILITY across many of our existing home plans which allows our customers to take existing space in the home and create the room they most need, like a home office, classroom, multigenerational suite, or home gym.
Product Lines, Design and Construction
Our residential communities are generally located in suburban areas that are easily accessible through public and personal transportation. Our communities are designed as neighborhoods that fit existing land characteristics. We strive to achieve diversity among architectural styles within a community by offering a variety of house models and several exterior design options for each model. We also preserve existing trees and foliage whenever practicable. Normally, homes of the same type or color may not be built next to each other. We believe our communities have attractive entrances with distinctive signage and landscaping and that our attention to community detail avoids a “development” appearance and gives each community a diversified neighborhood appearance.
We offer homes ranging from a base sales price of approximately $200,000 to $1,045,000 and from approximately 1,100 to 5,500 square feet. In addition to single-family detached homes, we also offer attached townhomes in several of our markets. We believe that offering a wide range of homes enables us to attract first-time, millennial, move-up, empty-nester and luxury homebuyers. It is our goal to sell more than one home to our buyers, and we believe we have had success in this strategy.
We devote significant resources to the research, design and development of our homes to meet the demands of our buyers and evolving market requirements. For example, in 2020, our customers expressed increased interest in additional bedroom suite opportunities on the main floor, open bright spaces, improved work-from-home spaces and get-away spaces within the home such as lofts or bonus room options. Across all of our divisions, we currently offer over 600 different floor plans designed to reflect current lifestyles and design trends. 
We continue to change and update our plan portfolio based on trends and market conditions. In addition, we continue to develop new floor plans and communities specifically for the growing empty-nester market. These plans (primarily ranch and main floor master bedroom type plans) focus on move-down buyers, are smaller in size, and feature outdoor living potential, fewer bedrooms, and better community amenities. Our homebuilding divisions often share successful plans with other divisions, when appropriate.
We have successfully implemented our “Smart Series” across all of our divisions, and it represented approximately 34% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our “Smart Series” is intended to offer buyers excellent value, great locations, and pre-selected packages of upgraded finishes and appliances. Our “Smart Series” targets entry-level and move-down buyers and focuses significant attention on affordability, livability and offering some design flexibility to our customers. This series has become an important and successful part of our overall product lineup. Within the last year, we introduced several new townhome options into the Smart Series Collections. Our new townhome Smart Series programs are intended to be more affordable and take advantage of higher-density opportunities as stand-alone communities or paired with our conventional Smart Series single-family neighborhoods.
Our “City Collection” floor plans offer a unique and upscale urban lifestyle by utilizing narrow lots, detached rear garages and thoughtfully designed interiors. Our City Collection enables us to participate in new infill development opportunities that extend beyond our traditional suburban markets.
We design all of our product lines to reduce production costs and construction cycle times while adhering to our quality standards and using materials and construction techniques that reflect our commitment to more environmentally conscious homebuilding methods. All of our homes are constructed according to proprietary designs that meet the applicable FHA and VA requirements and all local building codes. We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials. Our raw materials consist primarily of lumber, concrete and similar construction materials, and while these materials are generally available from a variety of sources, we have reduced construction and administrative costs by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. Our homes are constructed according to standardized prototypes which are designed and engineered to provide innovative product design while attempting to minimize costs of construction and control product consistency and availability. We generally employ subcontractors for the installation of site improvements and the construction of homes. The construction of each home is supervised by a Personal Construction Supervisor who reports to a Production Manager, both of whom are employees of the Company. Our Personal Construction Supervisors manage the scheduling and construction process. Subcontractor work is performed pursuant to written agreements that require our subcontractors to comply with all applicable laws and labor practices, follow local building codes and permits, and meet performance, warranty, and insurance requirements. The agreements generally specify a fixed price for labor and materials and are structured to provide price protection for a majority of the higher-cost phases of construction for homes in our backlog. 
We begin construction on a majority of our homes after we have obtained a sales contract and preliminary oral confirmation from the buyer’s lender that financing should be approved. In certain markets, contracts may be accepted contingent upon the sale of an existing home, and construction may be authorized through a certain phase prior to satisfaction of that contingency. The construction of our homes typically takes approximately four to six months from the start of construction to completion of the home, depending on the size and complexity of the particular home being built, weather conditions, and the availability of labor, materials, and supplies. We also construct inventory homes (i.e., homes started in the absence of an executed contract) to facilitate delivery of homes on an immediate-need basis under our Ready Now Homes program and to provide presentation of new products. For some prospective buyers, selling their existing home has become a less predictable process and, as a result, when they sell their home, they often need to find, buy and move into a new home in 60 days or less. Other buyers simply prefer the certainty provided by being able to fully visualize a home before purchasing it. Of the total number of homes closed in both 2020 and 2019, 49% were inventory homes which include both homes started as inventory homes and homes that started under a contract that were later cancelled and became inventory homes as a result. 
Backlog
We sell our homes under standard purchase contracts, which generally require a homebuyer deposit at the time of signing the contract. The amount of the deposit varies among markets and communities. We also generally require homebuyers to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrades for their homes. Most of our home purchase contracts stipulate that if 
a homebuyer cancels a contract with us, we have the right to retain the homebuyer’s deposits. However, we generally permit our homebuyers to cancel their obligations and obtain refunds of all or a portion of their deposits (unless home construction has started) in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within the period specified in their contract to maintain goodwill with the potential buyer.
Backlog consists of homes that are under contract but have not yet been delivered. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net new contracts (new contracts for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes delivered during the current period. The backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations. Due to the seasonality of the homebuilding industry, the number of homes delivered has historically increased from the first to the fourth quarter in any year. Additionally, given the disruption in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 may not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve in future periods.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 4,389 homes in backlog with an aggregate sales value of $1.8 billion, in various stages of completion, including homes that are under contract but for which construction had not yet begun. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 2,671 homes in backlog, with an aggregate sales value of $1.1 billion. Homes included in year-end backlog are typically included in homes delivered in the subsequent year.
Warranty
We provide certain warranties in connection with our homes and also perform inspections with the buyer of each home immediately prior to delivery and as needed after a home is delivered. The Company offers both a transferable limited warranty program (“Home Builder’s Limited Warranty”) and a transferable structural limited warranty. The Home Builder’s Limited Warranty covers construction defects for a statutory period based on geographic market and state law (currently ranging from five to ten years for the states in which the Company operates) and includes a mandatory arbitration clause. The structural warranty is for 10 or 15 years for homes sold after December 1, 2015 and 10 or 30 years for homes sold after April 25, 1998 and on or before December 1, 2015. We also pass along to our homebuyers all warranties provided by the manufacturers or suppliers of components installed in each home. Although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects during their respective warranty periods, we are ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs during our applicable warranty period. Accordingly, we have estimated and established reserves for both our Home Builder’s Limited Warranty and potential future structural warranty costs based on the number of home deliveries and historical data trends for our communities. In the case of the structural warranty, we also employ an actuary to assist in the determination of our future costs on an annual basis. Our warranty expense (excluding stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities in 2020 and 2018 (as more fully discussed in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)) was approximately 0.7% of total housing revenue in both 2020 and 2019, and 0.8% of total housing revenue in 2018.
Land Acquisition and Development
We continuously evaluate land acquisition opportunities in the normal course of our homebuilding business, and we focus on both replenishing our lot positions and adding to our lot positions in key submarkets to expand our market share. Our goal is to maintain an approximate three to five-year supply of lots, including lots controlled under option contracts and purchase agreements, which we believe provides an appropriate horizon for addressing regulatory matters and land development and the subsequent build-out of the homes in each community, and allows us to manage our business plan for future home deliveries. 
We seek to meet our need for lots by obtaining advantageous land positions in desirable locations in a cost effective manner that is responsive to market conditions and maintains our financial strength and liquidity. Before acquiring land, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses, which assist us in evaluating the economic feasibility of each land acquisition. We consider a number of factors, including projected rates of return, estimated gross margins, and projected pace of absorption and sales prices of the homes to be built, all of which are impacted by our evaluation of population and employment growth patterns, demographic trends and competing new home subdivisions and resales in the relevant sub-market.
We attempt to acquire land with a minimum cash investment and negotiate takedown options when available from sellers. We also restrict the use of guarantees or commitments in our land contracts to limit our financial exposure to the amounts invested in the property and pre-development costs during the life of the community we are developing. We believe this approach significantly reduces our risk. In addition, we generally obtain necessary development approvals before we acquire land. We acquire land primarily through contingent purchase agreements, which typically condition our obligation to purchase land upon approval of zoning and utilities, as well as our evaluation of soil and subsurface conditions, environmental and wetland conditions, market analysis, development costs, title matters and other property-related criteria. All land and lot purchase agreements and the funding of land purchases require the approval of our corporate land acquisition committee, which is 
comprised of our senior management team and key operating and financial executives. Further details relating to our land option agreements are included in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In 2020, we continued to increase our investments in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to meet demand and expand our operations in certain markets. In 2020 and 2019, we developed over 83% and 81%, respectively, of our lots internally, primarily due to a lack of availability of developed lots in desirable locations in the market. Raw land that requires development generally remains more available. In order to minimize our investment and risk of large exposure in a single location, we have periodically partnered with other land developers or homebuilders to share in the cost of land investment and development through joint ownership and development agreements, joint ventures, and other similar arrangements. For joint venture arrangements where a special purpose entity is established to own the property, we enter into limited liability company or similar arrangements (“LLCs”) with the other partners. Further details relating to our joint venture arrangements are included in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the development of lots, we are required by some municipalities and other governmental authorities to provide completion bonds or letters of credit for sewer, streets and other improvements. The development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as homes are built and sold. In locations where development has progressed, the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit. 
Our ability to continue development activities over the long-term will depend upon, among other things, a suitable economic environment and our continued ability to locate suitable parcels of land, enter into options or agreements to purchase such land, obtain governmental approvals for such land, and consummate the acquisition and development of such land.
In the normal course of our homebuilding business, we balance the economic risk of owning lots and land with the necessity of having lots available for construction of our homes. The following table sets forth our land position in lots (including lots held in joint venture arrangements) at December 31, 2020:

 | Lots Owned | | 
Region | Developed Lots | Lots Under Development | Undeveloped Lots (a) | Total Lots Owned | Lots Under Contract | Total
Northern | 3,193 | | 370 | | 3,223 | | 6,786 | 7,801 | 14,587
Southern | 2,289 | | 1,878 | | 5,846 | | 10,013 | 14,909 | 24,922
Total | 5,482 | | 2,248 | | 9,069 | | 16,799 | 22,710 | 39,509

(a)Includes our interest in raw land held by joint venture arrangements expected to be developed into 700 lots.
Financial Services
We sell our homes to customers who generally finance their purchases through mortgages. M/I Financial provides our customers with competitive financing and coordinates and expedites the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application, loan approval, and closing and title services. M/I Financial provides financing services in all of our housing markets. We believe that our ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales.
M/I Financial has been approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA and USDA to originate mortgages that are insured and/or guaranteed by these entities. In addition, M/I Financial has been approved by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) as a seller and servicer of mortgages and as a Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) issuer. Our agency approvals, along with a sub-servicing relationship, allow us to sell loans on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis. This option provides flexibility and additional financing options to our customers.
We also provide title and closing services to purchasers of our homes through our 100%-owned subsidiaries, TransOhio Residential Title Agency Ltd., M/I Title Agency Ltd., and M/I Title LLC. Through these entities, we serve as a title insurance agent by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to purchasers of our homes in the Columbus, Cincinnati, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Tampa, Orlando, Sarasota, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin and Indianapolis markets.  In addition, TransOhio Residential Title Agency Ltd. provides examination and title insurance services to our housing markets in the Raleigh, Charlotte and Chicago markets. We assume no underwriting risk associated with the title policies.
Corporate Operations
Our corporate operations and home office are located in Columbus, Ohio, where we perform the following functions at a centralized level:
•establish strategy, goals and operating policies;
•ensure brand integrity and consistency across all local and regional communications;
•monitor and manage the performance of our operations;
•allocate capital resources;
•provide financing and perform all cash management functions for the Company, and maintain our relationship with lenders;
•maintain centralized information and communication systems; and
•maintain centralized financial reporting, internal audit functions, and risk management.
Competition
The homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We operate as a top ten builder in the majority of our markets. We compete with numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly-owned builders and developers, some of which have greater financial, marketing, land acquisition, and sales resources than us. Previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. 
Our financial services operations compete with other mortgage lenders to arrange financings for homebuyers. Principal competitive factors include pricing, mortgage loan terms, underwriting criteria, interest rates, customer service and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our homebuilding operations are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment, including storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws and existing conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.
Our homebuilding operations are also subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building, design, construction, sales, and similar matters. These regulations increase the cost to produce and market our products, and in some instances, delay our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. In addition, our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. We may also experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities. During 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced some delays in receiving governmental and municipality approvals and expect that trend to continue.
Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (including requirements for participation in programs offered by FHA, VA, USDA, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). These regulations restrict certain activities of our financial services operations as further described in our description of “Risk Factors” below in Item 1A. In addition, our financial services operations are subject to regulation at the state and federal level, including regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices.
Seasonality
Our homebuilding operations experience significant seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels. In general, homes delivered increase substantially in the second half of the year. We believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter, as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions. Our financial services operations also experience seasonality because their loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations. 
Additionally, given the disruption in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve in future periods.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, we employed 1,515 people (including part-time employees), including 1,201 in homebuilding operations, 206 in financial services and 108 in management and administrative services. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
We believe that our employees are our most important resource. To fuel our success, we seek to recruit the best talent in the homebuilding industry, whether they be new or seasoned homebuilding professionals, and advance all of our employees through training, development, mentoring, and career advancement. Our workforce development strategy is rooted in building a workforce in which individuals from a diverse mix of backgrounds, experiences and talents can thrive and contribute. We recognize the value of creating a collaborative, inclusive workplace, and to help foster such an environment, we promote a culture of mutual understanding and respect among employees, customers and building partners.
We believe in developing each employee’s professional skill set and promoting career development. Our operating divisions assign training to our employees based upon their particular roles and responsibilities. In addition, all of our employees must adhere to our code of conduct and participate in mandatory company-wide training sessions to ensure all employees follow the same set of safety and ethical standards. These training sessions cover topics such as workplace safety, cyber security, risk mitigation, harassment and discrimination.
We pay our employees competitively and offer a comprehensive set of benefits to full-time employees, including a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan to help employees plan for retirement, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry.
During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous safety protocols and procedures to protect our employees, customers and building partners, including complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards required by federal, state and local government agencies and taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. We implemented appointment-only customer interactions and sold homes via our digital platform and virtual correspondence. Our mortgage operations were also able to continue to close loans, at times utilizing drive-through closings. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in our description of “Risk Factors” below in Item 1A.
