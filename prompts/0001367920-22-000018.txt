Item 1. | Business

OVERVIEW
We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is developing CTP-543, a Janus Kinase 1 and Janus Kinase 2 (JAK 1/2) inhibitor that we discovered through the application of our DCE Platform® (deuterated chemical entity platform). We are evaluating CTP-543 in a Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of alopecia areata, a serious autoimmune dermatological condition. If these trials are successful, we intend to file a New Drug Application, or NDA, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2023. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for alopecia areata.
OUR STRATEGY
We are focused on conducting our Phase 3 clinical program for CTP-543 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe alopecia areata, seeking approval for CTP-543 from the FDA and subsequently commercializing CTP-543 in the United States. CTP-543 is currently progressing in two fully-enrolled Phase 3 clinical trials in adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. If we receive positive outcomes from these trials, we intend to file an NDA with the FDA in the first half of 2023. We are conducting pre-commercial activities, with the intent of selling CTP-543 in the United States ourselves or with strategic partners. 
If we are successful in gaining FDA approval for CTP-543 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe alopecia areata, we intend to evaluate CTP-543 in younger patients with alopecia areata and explore expanding CTP-543 into additional indications. We are also assessing both internal and potential in-licensed candidates for pipeline expansion.
CTP-543
Background on Alopecia Areata
Alopecia areata is a serious, chronic autoimmune disease that results in partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and/or body. Alopecia areata occurs when the immune system attacks the hair follicles and is characterized as non-scarring hair loss. It presents in a number of patterns including:
•Patchy: coin-sized or larger patch or patches of hair loss;
•Totalis: no hair on the scalp; and
•Universalis: no hair anywhere on the body.
Onset can occur at any age including childhood, and it affects both women and men equally. The average age of onset is between 25-35 years. The emotional effect of alopecia areata can be considerable and may result in anxiety and depression or affect personal attributes such as self-esteem and confidence. Alopecia areata may also be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis and vitiligo. The most common form of treatment is corticosteroids, including intralesional injections or topical application. However, corticosteroids are typically not well tolerated and often provide limited efficacy. There are currently no treatments approved by the FDA for alopecia areata.
CTP-543 Opportunity
We believe that the market opportunity to treat alopecia areata within the United States is significant. Based on a recent large cross-sectional survey study, it is estimated that the current prevalence of alopecia areata in the United States is up to approximately 1.5 million persons (Benigno M. Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2020). The study also estimates that about 43% of the alopecia areata population in the United States has 50% or greater loss of scalp hair. Given this prevalence and the substantial impact of alopecia areata on quality of life, the burden of alopecia areata within the United States is considerable. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for alopecia areata, and we believe that the market opportunity within the United States could support multiple approved treatments.
CTP-543 is an oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor that we are developing for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata. The FDA has granted CTP-543 Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia 
areata and Fast Track designation for the treatment of alopecia areata. CTP-543 is currently in Phase 3 development and could be one of the first treatments on the market if approved by the FDA.
Clinical Development of CTP-543
We have completed multiple Phase 2 trials of CTP-543 for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata to support the advancement of the program into Phase 3 development. In September 2019, we announced results from a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, dose-ranging trial to evaluate three sequential doses of CTP-543 (4, 8 and 12 mg twice-daily) and a placebo control in 149 patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. Patients treated with either 8 mg twice-daily or 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 met the primary efficacy endpoint with statistically significant differences (p <0.001) relative to placebo in the percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 50% relative change from baseline at 24 weeks. The 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily dose groups were also significantly different from placebo in the number of patients achieving ≥ 75% and ≥ 90% relative change in Severity of Alopecia Tool, or SALT, score between baseline at 24 weeks. A numerically but not statistically greater percentage of patients treated with the 4 mg twice-daily dose of CTP-543 met the primary efficacy endpoint. At 24 weeks, patients treated with 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily doses compared to placebo also rated significantly greater improvement in their alopecia areata on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale. Treatment with CTP-543 was generally well tolerated. The most common side effects in the 8 mg or 12 mg twice-daily dose groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, acne, nausea and low-density lipoprotein increase. One serious adverse event of facial cellulitis was reported in the 12 mg twice-daily dose group as possibly related to treatment; however, after a brief interruption, treatment continued and this patient completed the trial. No thromboembolic events were reported during the trial.
In June 2020, we released new data analyses from our Phase 2 dose-ranging trial of CTP-543 supporting the design of our Phase 3 program. The new data analyses revealed that statistically significant results were reported for the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 at more stringent response thresholds, which may be more clinically meaningful to patients, and positive findings were reported for clinician and patient reported outcome measures of scalp hair loss. At 24 weeks, 26% and 42% of patients who received CTP-543 in the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily cohorts, respectively, achieved an absolute SALT score ≤ 20 (p <0.05 vs. placebo), indicating a clinically-meaningful 80% or greater scalp hair present. Data from the Clinician Global Impression of Improvement scale showed 75% of clinicians rated the response in the 12 mg twice-daily cohort and 61% of clinicians rated the response in the 8 mg twice-daily cohort as "much improved" or "very much improved" at 24 weeks. For both doses, there was a statistically significant difference from placebo (p <0.001).
In addition, we completed two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating twice-daily dosing of CTP-543 compared to once-daily dosing of CTP-543. Based on the findings from those trials, we are utilizing the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily doses in our ongoing clinical development program for CTP-543. The 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily arms of those studies provided efficacy comparable to the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily arms, respectively, of our Phase 2 dose-ranging trial.
We conducted an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in March 2020 and initiated the CTP-543 Phase 3 clinical program in November 2020, beginning with the THRIVE-AA1 trial. The THRIVE-AA1 trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of CTP-543 to evaluate hair regrowth using the SALT score after 24 weeks of dosing in 708 adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. The trial is evaluating 8 mg and 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 compared to placebo at sites in the United States, Canada and Europe. We announced the completion of enrollment of the THRIVE-AA1 trial in October 2021 and expect to report topline results in the second quarter of 2022.
In May 2021, we initiated the THRIVE-AA2 trial, which is our second Phase 3 clinical trial of CTP-543. The THRIVE-AA2 trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of CTP-543 to evaluate hair regrowth using the SALT score after 24 weeks of dosing in 517 adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. The trial is evaluating 8 mg and 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 compared to placebo at sites in the United States, Canada and Europe. We announced the completion of enrollment of the THRIVE-AA2 trial in January 2022 and expect to report topline results in the third quarter of 2022.
Eligible patients from our efficacy and safety studies with CTP-543 may also enroll in one of our open label, long-term extension studies. In July 2021, we provided an update showing that, relative to our Phase 2 clinical trials of CTP-543, hair regrowth using the SALT score was maintained or improved in the great majority of patients through one year of continuous dosing with 12 mg twice-daily of CTP-543.
Additional clinical trials are ongoing to support the submission of an NDA, which is currently planned for the first half of 2023.
EARLIER-STAGE PIPELINE
We are currently assessing earlier-stage pipeline candidates as potential development candidates, including a once-daily, modified release formulation of CTP-543.
COLLABORATION PRODUCT CANDIDATES
In addition to our wholly-owned development programs, we have entered into collaborative arrangements with companies to develop deuterium-modified versions of their marketed products. Our partners are currently responsible for all development and future commercialization activities under these arrangements. In each of these collaborations, the deuterium-modified compound was independently discovered by us.
For example, in February 2012, we entered into a development and license agreement, or the Avanir Agreement, with Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Avanir, a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., for the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize AVP-786. AVP-786 is a combination of deudextromethorphan hydrobromide (d6-DM) and quinidine sulfate (Q), a CYP2D6 inhibitor, being investigated for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In 2019, Avanir completed two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating AVP-786 for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. The second of the Phase 3 clinical trials did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints; however, following additional data analysis, Avanir decided to continue developing AVP-786 for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. Three additional Phase 3 clinical trials and an open label, long-term extension study for Alzheimer’s agitation are ongoing. Additionally, Avanir is conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating AVP-786 for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Under the Avanir Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $2.0 million and have received milestone payments of $6.0 million. We are eligible to earn up to $37.0 million in regulatory and commercial launch milestone payments with respect to AVP-786 and up to $125.0 million in sales-based milestone payments. Avanir is also required to pay us royalties at defined percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits below 20% on net sales of licensed products on a country-by-country basis. The royalty rate is reduced, on a country-by-country basis, during any period within the royalty term when there is no patent claim covering the licensed product in the particular country. We sold a portion of our right to receive these royalties in connection with a financing that we completed in November 2021. The purchasers will collectively own 35% of such royalties, with the percentage increasing incrementally up to 50% if all of the warrants issued in connection with the financing are exercised by the purchasers. 
ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CTP-656
In July 2017, we completed the sale of worldwide development and commercialization rights to CTP-656, now known as VX-561, and other assets related to the treatment of cystic fibrosis to Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vertex. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Vertex, or the Vertex Agreement, we received $160.0 million in cash. Additionally, upon the achievement of certain milestone events, Vertex agreed to pay us an aggregate of up to $90.0 million, or the Milestone Obligation.
In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Vertex Agreement, or the Vertex Amendment, pursuant to which Vertex paid us $32.0 million in cash in exchange for the removal of the Milestone Obligation. As a result of the Vertex Amendment, we are not entitled to receive any further payments pursuant to the Vertex Agreement.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We protect our product candidates through the use of patents, trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary know-how. The expected expiration dates listed below are before any patent term extension to which we may be entitled under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) or equivalent laws in other jurisdictions where we have issued patents.
CTP-543
We hold various patents and pending applications covering the composition of matter of deuterated analogs of ruxolitinib, including CTP-543, and methods of treating hair loss, including alopecia areata, with certain doses of CTP-543.
We hold U.S. Patent No. 9,249,149, or the '149 patent, covering the composition of matter of deuterated analogs of ruxolitinib, including CTP-543, and we have a corresponding U.S. patent application. We also have a corresponding patent and patent application in Europe and corresponding patents in Japan. Such patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2033.
We also hold U.S. Patent No. 10,561,659, or the '659 patent, covering methods of treating hair loss, including alopecia areata, with certain doses of CTP-543, and we have a corresponding U.S. patent application. We have corresponding patent applications in Europe and Japan. Such patent and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2037.
In April 2018, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, instituted an inter partes review, or IPR, brought against the '149 patent by Incyte Corporation, or Incyte. In April 2019, the PTAB issued a final written decision in connection with the IPR that held that the claims of the '149 patent were unpatentable as obvious. In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or Federal Circuit, granted our motion to vacate and remand the PTAB final written decision in light of the Federal Circuit ruling on the Constitution’s Appointments Clause in Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc. The Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, sought review of both Arthrex and the decision in our case in the Supreme Court. In June 2021, the Supreme Court decided that the remedy for a violation of the Appointments Clause should not be a hearing before a new panel of PTAB judges, but a remand to the PTO to allow the Director to consider whether to modify the decision of the PTAB. The Supreme Court remanded our case to the Federal Circuit in light of Arthrex, and the Federal Circuit granted our request for a remand to the PTO Director. We filed a request to have the PTO Director review the final written decision; however, that request was denied in January 2022. As a result, we intend to proceed with our appeal to the Federal Circuit. The '149 patent remains valid and enforceable until any appeals by us have been exhausted. In November 2021, Incyte also filed an opposition against the corresponding European patent to the '149 patent.
In addition, on May 12, 2021, the PTAB instituted a post grant review, or PGR, brought against the '659 patent by Incyte. We expect the PTAB to issue a final written decision in connection with the PGR by May 2022. We intend to vigorously defend the '149 and '659 patents.
Earlier-Stage Pipeline
We also have patent portfolios that are related to a number of earlier-stage pipeline candidates. These patent portfolios are wholly owned by us and include issued patents or patent applications that claim deuterated analogs of a number of non-deuterated drugs and drug candidates.
AVP-786
We granted Avanir exclusive licenses under our patent rights related to AVP-786 pursuant to the Avanir Agreement. These licensed patent rights include U.S. patents and pending applications covering the composition of matter and methods of use of deudextromethorphan and other deuterated dextromethorphan analogs. Such U.S. patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2028 and 2030. We have also licensed to Avanir corresponding patents and patent applications in Europe and Japan. Such foreign patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2028.
Patent Term
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the United States and other countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
Under U.S. patent law, the patent term may be extended by patent term adjustment due to certain failures of the PTO to act in a timely manner. The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents that we believe are eligible for such extension. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in other jurisdictions where these are available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of product candidates for our clinical trials. We obtain these manufacturing services, including both the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, on a purchase order basis and have not yet entered into long-term supply contracts with any of these third-party manufacturers. We expect to rely on third parties for commercial manufacturing for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval.
When manufacturing our product candidates, we incorporate deuterium using either deuterium oxide or deuterated chemical reagents (which themselves are derived from deuterium oxide). As a result, we rely on being able to obtain and transport deuterated materials in order to manufacture our product candidates.
We purchase our raw materials on a purchase order basis and have not entered into long-term supply contracts with any of these third-party suppliers. We believe that the raw materials for our product candidates are readily available and that the cost of manufacturing for our product candidates will not preclude us from selling them profitably, if approved for sale.
COMMERCIALIZATION
We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. We plan to use a combination of third-party collaboration, licensing and distribution arrangements and a focused in-house commercialization capability to sell any of our products that receive marketing approval. With respect to the United States, we plan to seek to retain full commercialization rights for products that we can commercialize with a specialized sales force and to retain co-promotion or similar rights when feasible in indications requiring a larger commercial infrastructure. We plan to collaborate with third parties for commercialization in the United States of any products that require a large sales, marketing and product distribution infrastructure. We also plan to collaborate with third parties for commercialization outside the United States.
We plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. We expect the responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine.
COMPETITION
The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We expect that we, and our collaborators, will face significant competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to our product candidates that we, or they, may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Specifically, there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, simpler to use, have fewer or more tolerable side effects or are less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop or acquire, which could render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we, or our collaborators, may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other marketing approval for their products before we, or our collaborators, are able to obtain approval for ours, which could reduce our ability to utilize expedited regulatory pathways and could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we, or our collaborators, are able to enter the market. In addition, our competitors may succeed in obtaining and asserting patents that dominate our products, preventing our operational freedom.
Many of our existing and potential future competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We are developing CTP-543 as an oral agent for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata. If CTP-543 receives marketing approval for this indication, it may face competition from a number of other product candidates that are being studied for alopecia areata. Other companies in late-stage development of oral JAK inhibitors for the treatment of alopecia areata include Eli Lilly and Company and Pfizer Inc.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, sales, distribution, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
•production of well-characterized drug substance and drug product, and potentially matching placebos;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND application, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA otherwise informs the drug’s sponsor within 30 days;
•agreement by clinical investigators and their clinical trial sites, followed by approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site, before the clinical trial may be initiated at that site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient or active ingredients thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
Nonclinical Studies and an IND
Before testing any investigational drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous nonclinical testing. Nonclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for efficacy and adverse events and, in some cases, to 
establish a rationale for human therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the relevant nonclinical tests, including all tests conducted under GLPs, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans, and it must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A clinical trial on partial clinical hold may begin, but under the limitations set forth by FDA. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence or commence as originally requested.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a partial or complete clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institute of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCPs, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Human clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

Phase 1: | The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
Phase 2: | The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and dosage for Phase 3 studies. 
Phase 3: | The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as the data monitoring committee or board. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on review of certain data from the trial. The FDA will often inspect one or more clinical sites in late-stage clinical trials to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track product or regenerative advanced therapy.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMPs. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a user fee, which is adjusted on an annual basis.
Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, or its affiliate submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third party controls, or has the power to control, both entities.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission of its decision whether to accept the NDA for filing. Such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. The FDA may also request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards, including cGMPs. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals under PDUFA in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process may be extended by the FDA for three 
additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMPs and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
The FDA also may require submission and agreement of a REMS to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks prior to approving an NDA. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
The FDA may also refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not required. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and clinical sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, the FDA could require that a “black box” warning be included in the product label at the time of approval of a product or following approval of a product based on the drug class, even if the safety concern is not known to be associated with that specific product.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or facilitate the development and review of new drugs that meet certain criteria and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
New drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate early and frequent meetings between the FDA and the sponsor company during development and the FDA may agree to review sections of an NDA on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted. A drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides for frequent meetings between the sponsor and the FDA, involving senior and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-functional review and the assignment of an FDA project lead to facilitate efficient review of the development program and serve as a scientific liaison with the sponsor. Although Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not affect the regulatory standards for approval, the frequent interactions with the FDA may facilitate a more efficient development program. In addition, the NDAs for drugs granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation may become eligible for priority review. Priority review is designed for drug candidates that offer significant improvements in safety or effectiveness or fill an unmet medical need and provides for an initial review within six months of acceptance of the NDA for filing, as compared to a standard review of ten months after acceptance for filing. Accelerated approval provides an earlier 
approval of drugs that treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need, based on a surrogate endpoint that the FDA determines is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that the sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period.
Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review will not be shortened. Regardless of any accelerated review period under these programs, the review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are generally submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This latter type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar reference product, or may rely on published literature for a previously approved drug product, also known as a listed drug. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for which the applicant relies, as part of its application, on certain investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe and effective for use “that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain nonclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the listed drug has been approved, subject to any regulatory exclusivities or patents for the listed drug (as further described below), as well as for any new indication or use sought by the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
If our partners submit NDAs for approval of deuterated analogs of marketed compounds for which they are the NDA holder, we believe that in certain cases the FDA may allow referencing of data from the non-deuterated compound in support of the application for approval of the deuterated product. Since this referencing by our partners would involve use of their own data and not require the use of another party’s data, it would constitute a Section 505(b)(1) application.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also is an annual prescription drug user fee for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with 
a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or withdrawal of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the nonclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the "reference listed drug." To reference that information, however, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate, and the FDA must conclude, that the generic drug does, in fact, perform in the same way as the reference listed drug it purports to copy.
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the reference listed drug with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a reference listed drug if “the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the reference listed drug. . .”
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the reference listed drug and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider the therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the reference listed drug. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of a therapeutic equivalence rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of data exclusivity for new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been previously approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such new chemical entity exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied 
by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five year new chemical entity exclusivity, an award of three year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product.
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
•the required patent information has not been filed;
•the listed patent has expired;
•the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
•the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earliest of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans within 60 days of an end of Phase 2 meeting, or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after efficacy and safety has been established in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Generally, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Those Amendments permit a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and ultimate approval. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. The PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for issuing an Opinion following the initial assessment of an MAA. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, 
when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. Following a positive opinion by the CHMP, the final authorization is issued by the European Commission.
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days after receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical tests, nonclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Factors considered by payors in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: 
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary; 
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and 
•neither experimental nor investigational.
The containment of healthcare costs has also become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment 
programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products and re-importation of products sold outside of the United States. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, including importation of drugs into the United States from lower-cost countries, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Outside of the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for products remains challenging. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, included changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA included provisions of importance to our potential product candidate that: 
•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
•expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
•expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
•addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
•establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending;
•established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
•created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
There remain numerous judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the Supreme Court, and the former Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or biologics. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, effective as of January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, eliminating the implementation of certain of the ACA’s mandated fees and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administrations or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps and by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the federal government pays for drugs and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and 
the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. 
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, we may face competition in the United States for our product candidates, if approved, from therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the FDA issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The market implications of the final guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability. Further, legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates or put pressure on our product pricing.
In addition, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, on April 18, 2020, CMS announced that qualified health plan issuers under the ACA may suspend activities related to the collection and reporting of quality data that would have otherwise been reported between May and June 2020 given the challenges healthcare providers are facing responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. For example, in Canada, price control legislation for patented medicines is currently undergoing significant change that may have significant effects on profitability for companies selling products in Canada. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements 
and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which imposes civil monetary penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
•the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•the federal anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
•the federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•the federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
•the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers may also be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and that potentially harm consumers. 
The distribution of drugs and biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
The full scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have continued to increase their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
