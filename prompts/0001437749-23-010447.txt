Item 1. Business
General
 
We are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the development and production of oil and gas.  At December 31, 2022, our estimated net proved reserves were 7.9 MMBoe, 42% were oil and 92% of which (on a Boe basis) were operated by us.  Our daily net production for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2,231 Boepd, of which 51%, on a BOE basis, was oil. Abraxas Petroleum Corporation was incorporated in Nevada in 1990. Our address is 19100 Ridgewood Parkway, Suite 1200, San Antonio, Texas 78259 and our phone number is (210) 490-4788.
 
Our oil and gas assets were located in the Permian/Delaware Basin as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Recent Activity
 
Our business strategy is to extract resources from our core operated basin.  
 
  Our primary source of capital is cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding debt.
 
Profitably grow production and reserves. We have a substantial low-decline legacy production base as evidenced by our approximate 21-year average reserve life as of year-end 2022. 
 
Further Recent Activity 
 
 Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of January 3, 2022, between the Company and AG Energy Funding, LLC (“AGEF”) and certain other agreements entered into by the Company on January 3, 2022, we effectuated a restructuring of the Company’s then-existing indebtedness through a multi-part interdependent deleveraging transaction consisting of: (i) an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the Company sold to Lime Rock Resources V-A, L.P. certain oil, gas, and mineral properties in the Williston Basin region of North Dakota and other related assets belonging to the Company and its subsidiaries for $87.2 million in cash ($73.3 million after customary closing adjustments), (the “Sale”), (ii) the pay down of the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the First Lien Credit Facility; and (iii), a debt for equity exchange of the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the $100.0 million Second Lien Credit Facility, and all related loan and security documents (the “Exchange” and, together with the transactions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), the “Restructuring”). 

 AGEF was issued 685,505 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Preferred Shares") in the Exchange. The Series A Preferred Stock has the terms set forth in the Company’s filed Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (the “Certificate").  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock vote together as a single class with the Company’s common stock, and each share of Series A Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to 69 votes. Accordingly, AGEF’s ownership of the Series A Preferred Stock entitled it to approximately 85% of the voting power of the Company’s then outstanding capital stock. 
  
On September 13, 2022, AGEF and Biglari Holdings Inc, ("Biglari Holdings") entered into the a preferred stock purchase agreement (the "Preferred Purchase Agreement"), and an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which AGEF agreed to sell and assign to Biglari Holdings (the "Sales and Assignment Agreement"), and Biglari Holdings agreed to purchase, acquire, and assume from AGEF, the Preferred Shares and all of AGEF’s rights, title, and interests in, and duties and obligations under, the Exchange Agreement. Biglari Holdings’ ownership of the Preferred Shares resulted in its beneficial ownership, both directly and indirectly, of the approximately 85% of the Company’s voting securities that AGEF owned prior to effecting the Sale and Assignment.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Purchase Agreement, the four directors of the Company appointed by AGEF resigned from the Board. Also, in accordance with the terms of the Preferred Purchase Agreement, on September 13, 2022, the Board voted to appoint Messrs. Sardar Biglari, Philip Cooley, and Bruce Lewis as members of the Board to fill three of the vacancies created by the resignations of the AGEF appointed directors. All three newly appointed members of the Board are affiliated with Biglari Holdings.
 
Subsequent to the Sale and Assignment, Biglari Holdings proposed an exchange of the Preferred Shares for shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to which the Company would issue Biglari Holdings 90,631,287 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Stock Consideration”) in exchange for the Preferred Shares (such transaction, the “Second Exchange”).
 
    5 

  

To issue the Stock Consideration to Biglari Holdings as contemplated by the Second Exchange, an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation was needed to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance from 20,000,000 shares to 150,000,000 shares (the “Amendment”).
 
On September 23, 2022, the Board approved the Company’s entry into an exchange agreement with Biglari Holdings defining the terms of the Second Exchange (the “Second Exchange Agreement”). The Company and Biglari Holdings entered into the Second Exchange Agreement on September 27, 2022, with the consummation of the Second Exchange subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders of the Amendment and the acceptance of the Amendment of the Nevada Secretary of State.
 
On October 24, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved the Amendment, and the Company caused the Amendment to be filed with the Nevada Secretary of State that same day. The Nevada Secretary of State accepted the Amendment on October 25, 2022, and on October 26, 2022, the Second Exchange Agreement was consummated by the following transactions: (i) the Company caused 90,631,287 shares of common stock to be registered in the name of Biglari Holdings with the Company’s transfer agent in book-entry form, and (ii) Biglari Holdings assigned and transferred the Preferred Shares to the Company, constituting all of the Preferred Shares of the Company then outstanding, by delivering a Stock Power and Assignment to the Company. The Company cancelled the Series A Preferred Stock and the Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation, such that only common stock of the Company remains outstanding. 
 
As a result of the Sale and Assignment and Second Exchange, the Company is a consolidated subsidiary of Biglari Holdings, which has the power to exert significant control over the Company by controlling both 90% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock and a majority of the Company’s Board. 
 
Markets and Customers
 
The revenue generated by our operations is highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our oil and gas production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control including seasonality, the condition of the world wide economy (particularly the manufacturing sector), foreign imports, political conditions in other petroleum producing countries, the actions of OPEC, domestic regulation, legislation and policies, and the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious diseases, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak.  Decreases in the prices we receive for our oil and gas have had, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves, our revenue, profitability and cash flow from operations. Refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Industry — Market conditions for oil and gas and particularly volatility of prices for oil and gas, could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows from operations, profitability and growth” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies” for more information relating to the effects that decreases in oil and gas prices have on us. 
 
Substantially all of our oil and gas is sold at current market prices under short-term arrangements, as is customary in the industry. During the year ended December 31, 2022, three purchasers of production accounted for approximately 90% of our oil and gas sales. During the year ended December 31, 2021, four purchasers of production accounted for approximately 83% of our oil and gas sales.

Regulation of Oil and Gas Activities
 
The exploration, production and transportation of all types of hydrocarbons are subject to significant governmental regulations. Our properties are affected from time to time in varying degrees by political developments and federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and gas production operations and economics are, or in the past have been, affected by industry specific price controls, taxes, conservation, safety, environmental and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, and by changes in such laws and by periodically changing administrative regulations.
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern oil and gas activities. Operators of oil and gas properties are required to have a number of permits in order to operate such properties, including operator permits and permits to dispose of salt water. In addition, under federal law, operators of oil and gas properties are required to possess certain certificates and permits in order to operate such properties. We possess all material requisite permits required by federal, state and other local authorities in which we operate properties.
 
Development and Production
 
The operations of our properties are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulations include requiring the operator of oil and gas properties to possess permits for the drilling and development of wells, post bonds in connection with various types of activities, and file reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities in which we operate, regulate one or more of the following:

• | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the flaring of gas;
--+--------------------


• | the method of completing and fracture stimulating wells;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | the notice to surface owners and other third parties.
--+------------------------------------------------------

The gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other gas producers, gatherers and marketers.
 
Generally, intrastate gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, although FERC does regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of service provided by intrastate pipelines that transport gas subject to FERC’s NGA jurisdiction pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. The basis for state regulation of intrastate gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship gas on an intrastate basis will not affect the operations of our properties in any way that is materially different from the effect of such regulation on our competitors.
 
Regulation of Transportation of Oil in the United States
 
We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, the adoption of any regulations that impact the testing or handling of shipments of oil by rail transportation could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the United States, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business if new federal or state rail transportation regulations are enacted.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Oil and gas operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the generation, use, treatment, storage and disposal of materials and the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may: 

• | require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impose design, construction and permitting requirements on facilities in conjunction with oil and gas operations, including the construction of pollution control devices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require protective measures to prevent certain fluids from coming into contact with ground water;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production, and gas processing activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspend, limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities in certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species and other protected areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from historical and on-going operations such as the use of pits and plugging of abandoned wells;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require disclosure of chemicals injected into wells in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrict injection of liquids into subsurface strata that may contaminate groundwater or increase seismic activity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrict the availability of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impose substantial penalties for violations of environmental rules or pollution resulting from our operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | curtail production in association with permit limits; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | curtail or prohibit production for exceeding gas flaring limits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Environmental permits that the operators of properties are required to possess may be subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and permits, and violations are subject to injunction, civil fines, and even criminal penalties. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, and that we will not be required to make material capital expenditures to comply with existing laws. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our operations as well as the oil and gas industry in general, and thus we are unable to predict the ultimate cost and effects of future changes in environmental laws and regulations.
 
We are not currently involved in any administrative, judicial or legal proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental protection laws and regulations, or under federal or state common law, which would have a material adverse effect on our respective financial positions or results of operations. Moreover, we maintain insurance against the costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. A serious incident of pollution may result in the suspension or cessation of operations in the affected area.

Abandonment Costs.    All of our oil and gas wells will require proper plugging and abandonment at some time in the future. We have posted bonds with most regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with our plugging responsibility. Plugging and abandonment operations and associated reclamation of the surface site are important components of our environmental management system. We plan accordingly for the ultimate disposition of properties that are no longer producing.
Title to Properties
 
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we make only a cursory review of title to undeveloped oil and gas leases at the time we acquire them. However, before drilling commences, we make a thorough title search, and any material defects in title are remedied prior to the time actual drilling of a well begins. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects, we, rather than the seller/lessor of the undeveloped property, are typically obligated to cure any title defect at our expense. If we were unable to remedy or cure any title defect of a nature such that it would not be prudent to commence drilling operations on the property, we could suffer a loss of our entire investment in the property. We believe that we have good titles to our properties, some of which are subject to immaterial encumbrances, easements and restrictions. The oil and gas properties we own are also typically subject to royalty and other similar non-cost bearing interests customary in the industry. We do not believe that any of these encumbrances or burdens will materially affect our ownership or use of our properties.
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the exploration and production of oil and gas are leasehold prospects under which oil and gas reserves may be discovered, drilling rigs and related equipment and services to explore for such reserves and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of oil and gas operations. We must compete for such resources with both major oil and gas companies and independent operators. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Although we believe our current operating and financial resources are adequate to preclude any significant disruption of our near-term operations, we cannot assure you that such materials and resources will be available to us in the future.
Employees
 
As of March 18, 2023, we had 18 full-time employees. We retain independent geological, land, marketing, engineering and health and safety consultants from time to time and expect to continue to do so in the future.
