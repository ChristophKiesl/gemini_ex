Our Business
Our Mission.  Diversey’s mission is to protect and care for people through leading hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning solutions. We develop and deliver innovative, mission-critical products, services and technologies that save lives and protect our environment.
Our Foundation. Over the course of 100 years, the Diversey brand has become synonymous with product quality, service and innovation. Our fully-integrated suite of solutions combines patented chemicals, dosing and dispensing equipment, cleaning machines, services and digital analysis and serves more than 85,000 customers in over 80 countries via our vast network of approximately 9,000 employees globally. We are the leading global pure play provider to the approximately $46 billion cleaning and hygiene industry for the Institutional and Food & Beverage markets, where we hold the first or second position in the key markets in which we operate. We are also one of only two large, global players able to serve global strategic accounts (“GSAs”). We consider our scale to be a distinct competitive advantage given the fragmentation of our industry, and our customer relationships are deep and longstanding, resulting in highly recurring revenue streams.
Our Value Proposition.  We are a trusted partner to our customers in delivery of hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning solutions that provide peace of mind and help our customers maintain their brand integrity and grow their businesses. Through our end-to-end, repeatable services, we focus on achieving the following outcomes for our customers:
• Improved hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning results
• Improved operational efficiency and environmental sustainability
• Reduced costs
• High consistency and high standards across customer locations and geographies
Our customer engagement model drives a virtuous circle of customer acquisition, service expansion, and long-term retention that enables our history of strong growth and resiliency. Through our customer engagement model we strive to:
• Understand Customer Needs and Goals. We partner with customers to determine what matters most to them, with a focus on outcomes rather than specific products.
• Design Custom Solutions.  We then design custom solutions, leveraging our 1,300 patents and patent applications from our library of more than 2,000 unique chemical formulations as well as our extensive and differentiated suite of dosing and dispensing equipment and floor care machines.
• Integrate Solutions with Customer Workflows. We train our customers’ end users on how to operate the products and equipment that make up our customized solutions, with a specific focus on health and safety considerations, sustainability, and service requirements.
• Optimize Performance.  After implementation, we remain engaged with our customers on a regular basis and leverage our digital monitoring capabilities to ensure their equipment is operating properly, the workforce is fully trained, and solutions are optimized.
• Expand the Value Proposition. As we continue to engage with our customers, we continually review our performance, compare ourselves against benchmarks, and work to identify ways to expand or enhance our services through new products and innovation, creating ‘win-win’ solutions for us and our customers, and further solidifying our partnership.

Initial Public Offering. On March 29, 2021, we completed an initial public offering of 46,153,846 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $15.00 per Ordinary Share, receiving $654.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses (the "IPO"). On April 9, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,000,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, receiving an incremental $71.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expense. Our Ordinary Shares trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "DSEY".

Prior to the formation of Diversey Holdings, Ltd., the organizational structure consisted of Constellation (BC) 2 S.à r.l ("Constellation"), which was incorporated on June 30, 2017, and organized under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société à Responsabilité Limitée for an unlimited period under the direction of Bain Capital, LP (“Bain Capital”). Diamond (BC) B.V., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation, was formed on March 15, 2017 for the purpose of consummating the acquisition of the Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business of Sealed Air Corporation (“Sealed Air”) (together, the “Diversey Business”), including certain assets and all the capital stock of certain entities engaged in the Diversey Business (the “Diversey Acquisition”), which acquisition closed on September 6, 2017. 
Business Developments: Take-Private Merger Agreement
On March 8, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“Parent”) and Diamond Merger Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into us (the “Merger”). We will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, our Ordinary Shares will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and we will cease to be a reporting company. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (“Platinum”), and affiliates of Solenis LLC, which is a portfolio company of Platinum. Parent will acquire all of our Ordinary Shares (except for Ordinary Shares held by BCPE Diamond Investor, LP (“BCPE”), our controlling shareholder and an affiliate of Bain Capital, LP) for $8.40 in cash per Ordinary Share. Ordinary Shares held by BCPE (other than the Rollover Shares, as defined below) will be purchased by Parent for $7.84 in cash per Ordinary Share. 
On March 8, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, BCPE and Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“Topco”), an affiliate of Platinum and, following the consummation of the Merger, our indirect parent, entered into the Rollover Contribution Agreement (the “Rollover Agreement”), pursuant to which BCPE will contribute certain of its Ordinary Shares (the “Rollover Shares”) to Topco (such Rollover Shares being valued at $7.84 per Ordinary Share), and Topco will accept such Rollover Shares in exchange for certain common and preferred units of Topco.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including receipt of the vote in favor of the authorization of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or by proxy at the shareholders’ meeting (the “Requisite Shareholder Approval”), expiration of waiting periods (and any extensions thereof), if any, applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain other specified regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Subject to the satisfaction (or, if applicable, waiver) of such conditions, the Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2023. 
Upon termination of the Merger Agreement by us or by Parent upon specified conditions, we will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $92.0 million. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement by us under other specified conditions, Parent will be required to pay us a termination fee of $125.0 million.

Our Sustainability Strategy
Protect. Care. Sustain. Our sustainability strategy will guide our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") priorities and actions. ESG is core to how we create value and drive growth. The strategy is supported by both 2030 goals and near-term targets which will further reduce our environmental footprint, address social inequality and deliver solutions to help our customers reach their own sustainability goals.
Our strategy builds upon Diversey’s longstanding sustainability mission:
We protect our planet and conserve natural resources. We care about our people, our partnerships, and our customers and are committed to address critical social challenges and reduce risk in our operations. We work tirelessly to sustain the highest standards in responsible business practices and transparency.
In the development of all products and services, we adhere to a green cleaning philosophy. This is defined as the use of cleaning products, equipment and methods that protect the health of building occupants, lower the total cost of cleaning and prevent environmental impacts. Green cleaning also considers chemicals’ and materials’ end of life to ensure that their disposal does not harm the environment. This ensures that all Diversey products and services are designed to enhance not only cleanliness and efficiency, but also safety and environmental sustainability for our customers and communities.
Hundreds of Diversey products are third-party certified, verifying that they meet the highest health, safety and sustainability standards. Among the certifications that our products feature:
• Cradle-to-Cradle
• EPA (Safer Choice)
• EU Ecolabel
• Green Seal
• Nordic Swan
• UL Environment: ECOLOGO, GREENGUARD
Sustainability is core to the value proposition we provide our customers. We partner with our customers to design solutions that enable them to meet their effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability goals. Given how engrained our products and services are in our customers’ operations, we are in a position to help them improve their performance in many key environmental areas, including reducing water, transportation, energy, greenhouse gas, packaging, waste, and chemical usage, as well as helping them extend equipment and product life and improve chemical and employee safety.
Our comprehensive approach to sustainability is also reflected in our commitment to our own employees. We have set internal goals to eliminate workplace injuries, train 100% of our employees on our Code of Conduct, and strengthen our community relations in the locations in which we operate. Protecting and caring for our people also means investing in their future. We believe in providing our employees with resources to help them develop leadership capabilities and advance their careers. We seek to maintain a company culture that fosters a true sense of purpose among our people that we believe will drive long-term success.
Finally, we lead by example by improving the environmental impact of our own operations. We have identified ambitious operational goals to continue to reduce and improve the impact we have on our planet. Key goals include, but are not limited to, achieving 100% compliance with our Responsible Chemistry Policy, Net zero carbon emissions by 2050, 100% of our packaging contributing to a circular economy by 2030, and a net positive ratio which demonstrates that our products save more energy, water, waste, and greenhouse gases for our customers than our operational footprint generates.
As we look to the future, we believe sustainability will continue to grow in importance for our customers. We are investing heavily and are well positioned to support our customers’ growing needs in this area, and as we do so, we will have the opportunity to further embed ourselves in their operations and grow with them.
We team up with our customers to forge socially responsible circularity. Our three social impact initiatives, Soap For Hope, Linens For Life, and Coffee Briques, illustrate our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Instead of discarding materials in landfills at the end of their useful life, we repurpose, or “upcycle,” soap products, linens and coffee briques in ways that create economic and social value, particularly for people in need. In recognition of the value of these initiatives and their benefit to the community, we were named winner of the "Profit with Purpose" award at the World Sustainability Awards 2022 for our Soap For Hope program, and were previously awarded "Asia's Best Community Care Company of the Year".
We believe our mission, culture, and social impact initiatives increase our employee engagement and ultimately lead to creating value and innovation for our employees, customers, and stakeholders.
Our Business Operations
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Inputs.  We manufacture a diverse portfolio of finished goods utilizing a combination of internal manufacturing facilities and strategic contract manufacturing. We maintain a global manufacturing network, operating twenty facilities on a global basis, with six factories in North America, six factories in Europe, three factories in Latin America, three factories in the Asia-Pacific region, and two factories in the Middle East and Africa region. Our facilities provide a strong base of owned and leased production facilities in established geographies and key emerging markets.
Our manufacturing strategy consists of using both internal and external manufacturing, which enables a flexible and geographically effective supply chain network for our solutions. Contract manufacturing complements our internal manufacturing capabilities and supports our existing offerings as well as innovations and new product launches, while also allowing us to pursue an asset-light business model. We contract with approximately 50 large strategic contract manufacturers which we believe efficiently augment our global supply chain network with additional geographic coverage and production capabilities. In developed markets, we use these strategic contract manufacturers to leverage variable capacity for unique production capabilities. In emerging markets, contract manufacturers provide strategic capacity where we do not yet have critical mass. Where contract manufacturing is used, the production processes mirror those of our internal manufacturing plants to ensure quality control.
Our primary raw material inputs include caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates, surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates, fragrances and wipes substrate material, all of which are generally available from multiple suppliers. Our packaging purchases include bag-in-the-box containers, bottles, corrugated boxes, drums, pails, totes, aerosol cans, caps, triggers and valves. Our equipment and accessories purchases include dilution control equipment, warewashing and laundry equipment, floor care machines, air care dispensers, floor care applicators, mops, microfiber, buckets, carts and other items used in facility maintenance.
We have long-term relationships with an extensive network of suppliers. Supplier contracts are typically multiyear, with set pricing and renewal features built in and flexibility to adjust prices on the basis of underlying fluctuations in raw material costs. The majority of our critical raw material inputs are common to the industry and produced in all regions by multiple large, global suppliers, ensuring attractive input prices. We believe most components related to raw materials, equipment and accessories are readily available from multiple sources and to the extent possible, we offset higher costs of materials through pricing increases.
We generally operate on a yearly contracting cycle, using competitive request for proposal processes, e-auctions and open market events to select suppliers. Supply agreements are generally requirement-based, linked to demand in the annual operating plan and contain no or minimal contingent liability extending beyond one to two years.
Sales and Marketing.  We reach customers through a combination of direct sales channels and distribution channels. Direct sales channels represented approximately 80% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, including “ship-through” sales, where the customer relationship is managed by Diversey, while distribution channels represented the remaining 20% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. We employ a balanced marketing strategy with a global direct sales force as well as a broad network of third-party distributors in key locations, whereas many of our competitors sell solely or primarily through third-party distributors. We believe that this hybrid sales approach differentiates us, as our direct-sales capability is highly valued by many of our customers given the increasing importance of hygiene, while our use of third-party distributors helps us optimize operations in a cost-effective manner.
Our manufacturing network is supported by a global customer facing team of approximately 6,000 sales, marketing, technical service and customer service representatives. Our direct sales force manages relationships with our large global and regional customers while our third-party distributor partners enable us to reach end-users that would not be as efficient for us to serve on a direct basis. We have invested in extensive training for our direct sales force and the management of our distributor network, and we support our sales force with a deep bench of technical service representatives.
Our global strategic accounts help differentiate us from many of our competitors and are a source of significant market insight and growth through our “acquire, retain, and grow strategy”. Global strategic accounts help us build long-term contractual relationships, set standards of hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning, facilitate adoption of industry best practices, and provide a platform for local growth. In our Institutional business we have approximately 70 global strategic accounts, representing approximately 20% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a robust pipeline of strategic accounts with projects under implementation and opportunities to win substantial incremental sales. Sales for our global strategic accounts in 2022 were above 2021.
Research and Development. We maintain significant R&D capabilities to ensure we continue to remain an innovator and technological leader. We develop new products, applications, services, and processes while providing technical assistance to improve our customers’ operations.

Our value proposition is rooted in the integration of our proprietary technologies with our customers’ manufacturing and service delivery value chain. We have R&D and application support facilities in locations around the globe, including in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, to facilitate hands-on interaction with our customers. Our R&D engineering personnel innovate through both internal creation and development as well as through identifying and integrating third-party resources and technologies. We maintain a robust pipeline of new product development projects, which are in various stages of discovery and development.
Customers. Our Institutional and Food & Beverage segments serve customers across a wide variety of stable and growing end-markets. We are one of only two global players with the capabilities to serve GSAs, which represents more than 20% of our revenues. Approximately 84% of our customer relationships exceed 10 years in length. We have minimal customer concentration and high customer diversity as our largest customer accounted for 2.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, while our top 10 and top 50 customers represented 12% and 26% of our net sales over the same period, respectively. Our highly fragmented customer base adds to the stability of our revenue streams as activity across different customer groups is diverse and independent of activity among other customer verticals.
Our end-users span a wide range of business verticals, including, among other, healthcare, food service, retail and grocery, educational institutions, food and beverage, building service contractors, cash and carry establishments, government institutions, industrial plants, and on-premises laundry.
Our customers value both the products we sell as well as our application expertise, deep industry process knowledge, and project engineering capabilities. These capabilities maximize product and operational efficiency for our customers, resulting in sticky relationships. Additionally, we provide customized solutions for customers that are 
integrated into their sites, which encourage mutual investment in infrastructure and expands our value proposition, resulting in customer loyalty and retention.
Our Competition
In general, the markets in which we operate are led by two large companies: Diversey and Ecolab Inc., with the rest of the markets served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our business competes on the basis of its demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, chemical formulations, customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and dispensing equipment. Given our scale and global reach, we are able to uniquely service GSAs and provide consistent, quality solutions across sites. Our machines also differentiate us from our competitors, as no other competitor offers an equivalent range of product and service offerings, as well as machines, allowing us to provide our customers with end-to-end solutions.
Our scale provides a competitive benefit versus smaller local or regional competitors, as we are able to leverage our distribution network to service smaller customers in a cost-effective way.
Given the size and fragmented nature of the markets in which we operate, we do not currently have significant concern about our competition.
We believe that the fragmented nature of our markets, combined with our flexible go-to-market strategy and diverse product and solution set, should enable Diversey to grow organically and via an acquisition strategy.
Our Intellectual Property
We strategically manage our portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. Specifically, we rely upon trade secrets to protect the formulation of many of our chemical products, as well as our manufacturing processes. We own or license patents and trademarks which are used in connection with our business. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulations and processes used to manufacture our products. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 1,300 patents in the United States and in countries throughout the world, and have numerous pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.
The trademarks of major products in each business are registered in key jurisdictions or licensed from third parties. Certain intellectual property is also protected by confidentiality agreements or other agreements with suppliers, employees and other third parties. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and trade secrets.
The Diversey trademark and a select number of major sub-brands, including CLAX, SUMA and TASKI are material to our business. We own the Diversey and sub-brand trademarks used in our business. While the Diversey trademark and certain other assets in our intellectual property portfolio are important, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual trade name, trademark or patent.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 9,000 employees worldwide, including full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 1,000 of these employees were in the U.S., and approximately 8,000 employees were outside the U.S. In various countries, certain of our employees are unionized and, where local law requires, participate in works councils. Our customer facing team is comprised of approximately 6,000 employees and includes sales, marketing, technical service and customer service representatives. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
Our employees are at the heart of our mission and strategies, and we focus on our culture to drive both.
Our Core Values.
Our culture starts, first and foremost, with our mission: “To protect and care for people through providing leading hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning solutions.” Our mission unites and aligns our employees to serve a greater good in this world. This unity has been most evident during the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, as our employees have worked heroically to help protect and care for people around the world. In 2022, we reaffirmed the behaviors that we want Diversey to be known for as part of the way we work and hold each other accountable. Our behaviors are not empty words to be hung on a wall. The things we do, and the way we behave, define our culture. They empower us to deliver what we promise.
These behaviors are:
Inclusive.  A culture of collaboration. Diversey is a place that welcomes thoughts and ideas from all of our employees. People who feel comfortable coming to work and being themselves can achieve more. We hire and promote based on merit and develop talent within the organization. Our customers are diverse and operate in many different industries; therefore, we cannot be an organization with just one way of thinking. Our culture is inclusive of ideas and people. Sharing information and best practices improves all that we do.
Customer driven.  Delighting customers is at the heart of our business. Diversey elevates our customers and their experiences. We engage with our customers to know how we can protect them; how we can take care of them and how we can help solve their problems.
Bias for Action. Action unleashes our potential. Without action, achievement is impossible. Diversey is rightly proud of its place as an industry thought leader. Thoughts are seeds for action. We plan, we act with speed - all while taking calculated risks. 
Always improving.  Experience drives our improvement every day, and we are committed to continuously evolving. We believe that we can always find ways to improve. We take our experience, in the form of data and insights, and use it to drive customer satisfaction, revenue growth, and margins.
Accountable for results. Results inform our actions. We are responsible for owning our results and we commit to understanding them, good or bad. We speak clearly and honestly about our accomplishments and help each other avoid failure and replicate success. Being accountable for results is the end and beginning of everything we do.
Diversity and Inclusion
We seek to protect and care for our employees by creating a diverse, equitable & inclusive work environment where everyone feels free to be themselves. We have a goal to increase diverse representation in our workforce, starting with achieving gender diversity in our leadership population of 40% globally and ethnic diversity of 25% in the United States by 2030. We have also established Employee Representation Groups, which are grassroots employee networks that bring people together who share common interests and/or backgrounds and offer our employees a variety of benefits that support employees, including paid parental leave, flexible time off and solutions for nursing mothers.
Environmental Matters, Health and Safety and Governmental Regulations
As a manufacturer, we are subject to many laws, rules, standards and regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities in which we operate. These cover: the safe procurement, processing, storage and use of chemical raw materials and parts for tools, equipment and packaging; the potential release of materials into the environment; standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In some jurisdictions in which our products are sold or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate, among other things, minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed material and, more generally, the 
design for reuse of packaging materials. We maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to closely monitor their evolution.
Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regulate our products and often require us to obtain pre-market approval of our products and comply with specified requirements. In the U.S., we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and products intended for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and processed foods with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Such products are regulated in a similar way at the European Union level by the European Chemical Agency or by member state competent authorities. Similar requirements exist in other countries such as China, Russia and South Korea. To date, the cost of complying with such product registration requirements has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “can have”, “likely” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. For example, all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or our plans and objectives for future operations, growth initiatives, or strategies are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including:
• uncertainties associated with the proposed Merger, including the failure to complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all, restrictions on business conduct and potential lawsuits related to the proposed Merger;
• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;
• the inability to complete the proposed Merger due to the failure to satisfy conditions precedent, including satisfaction of the Requisite Shareholder Approval;
• risks related to disruption of management’s attention from our ongoing business operations due to the proposed Merger;
• the effect of the announcement of the proposed Merger on our relationships with our customers and on our operating results and business generally;
• the costs of the proposed Merger if the proposed Merger is not consummated;
• uncertain global economic conditions which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations;
• the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations;
• fluctuations between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations;
• political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows;
• raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins;
• if we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results would be negatively affected;
• cyber risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure;
• the introduction of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may adversely affect our effective rate of tax in future periods;
• the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations;
• we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate;
• instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our business;
• new and stricter regulations may affect our business and consolidated condition and results of operations; and
• the other risks described under “Risk Factors” below.
We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
We are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in our Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures.

•Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our shares of common stock.
•The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.
•We are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

•Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted geopolitical stability, increased economic uncertainty and disrupted capital markets.
Operational Risks

•Fluctuations in raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins and net sales.
•If we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our intellectual property, and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity.
•Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Strategic Risks

•A failure of our internal controls over financial reporting or our regulatory compliance efforts could harm our financial and operating results or could result in fines or penalties.
•Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.
Financial Risks 
•Our substantial indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain.
•Despite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.
•The terms of the financing documents governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.
•We entered into a tax receivable agreement that required us to make payments in relation to certain tax attributes of Constellation and its subsidiaries to persons who were shareholders of Constellation prior to the initial public offering and to certain other members of management, which payments are expected to be substantial.
