Industry Background
​
Conventional manufacturing processes have numerous shortcomings.
Historically, processes such as casting, stamping, molding and machining have dominated global manufacturing, which is a $12 trillion industry, according to estimates by A.T. Kearney. These conventional and subtractive manufacturing techniques have numerous limitations. Most require high upfront expenses in the form of tools, such as molds, dies, jigs or fixtures. Designing and manufacturing these tools can result in long lead times for parts as well as minimum volume requirements in order to achieve cost efficiencies. Tooling requirements associated with casting, stamping, and molding also leave little room for design iteration without increasing time-to-market and development costs. New parts and design changes often require a new mold, thereby slowing the pace at which businesses can introduce new products and react to shifts in market preferences and making it difficult to compete effectively. Computer numerical controlled machining, or CNC machining, is an alternative to stamping, casting and molding that does not require a mold or die, enabling lower-volume production with reduced lead times. However, because CNC machining is a subtractive process in which material is removed from a solid block to create a part, it typically results in higher part costs and significant material waste. In addition, the CNC machining process often requires heavy involvement from specialist technicians, and machine programming can be time intensive. Each of these conventional manufacturing processes also creates design restrictions that can result in significantly higher part weights and costs or require assemblies, adversely impacting performance in favor of manufacturability and driving additional manufacturing and supply chain complexity.
Additive manufacturing has the potential to address the limitations of conventional manufacturing.
Additive manufacturing addresses many of the limitations of conventional manufacturing through a combination of flexibility, ease of use and cost, making it an efficient and effective process across the product life cycle, from design and prototyping to production. Additive manufacturing is a digital manufacturing process that produces 3D objects from digital models through the repeated deposition of thin layers of material. This process eliminates the need for tooling inputs and provides a range of benefits including:

• | Accelerated time-to-market. Businesses can manufacture design files at the push of a button with no tooling required. While design cycles for conventional manufacturing can take weeks or months, additive manufacturing can shorten this cycle to days due to the ability to rapidly switch between or iterate on designs without excessive delay. Such improvements in time-to-market for new products can help businesses react more rapidly to shifts in customer demand. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design flexibility. Conventional manufacturing can force design comprises as a result of subtractive manufacturing processes or the use of tools. While 3D printing may involve design guidelines primarily to reduce dependency on supports and optimize process success, designers generally have freedom to produce geometries not possible or economically feasible with conventional manufacturing. As an example, with additive manufacturing, designers can produce intricate organic or complex, lattice shapes that are optimized for strength and functional performance to reduce weight and material usage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assembly consolidation. Improved design flexibility enables the consolidation of sub-assemblies into single parts, which can improve reliability by reducing the number of failure points in a product. Decreasing part quantity is also a productivity breakthrough for many businesses. With fewer unique parts to fabricate, procure, store and assemble, businesses can drastically simplify their supply chains. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mass customization. Additive manufacturing enables the customization and production of designs at scale, eliminating costs traditionally associated with multiple tools and tooling changeover as well as reducing the risk of excess inventory and material obsolescence. Each part printed using additive manufacturing can be identical to or radically different from the other parts within a given print. Several end markets, including audiology and dental, have already leveraged mass customization through additive manufacturing to improve the aesthetics and performance of parts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply chain re-engineering. Additive manufacturing suitable for end-use parts production can improve supply chains by enabling on-demand manufacturing in distributed locations. Decentralized networks of additive manufacturing systems with low tooling and set-up costs can replace centralized facilities with conventional manufacturing equipment. In addition, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6



producing parts near the point and time of demand can significantly reduce lead times, inventories, and dependencies on forecasting without incurring additional costs related to logistics and customs.

• | Sustainable manufacturing. Additive manufacturing is a more efficient production process than subtractive techniques, such as CNC machining. It requires fewer material inputs and reduces material waste. By enabling optimized geometries lighter than conventionally manufactured counterparts, additive manufacturing can also lead to downstream sustainability benefits, including reduced fuel consumption in industries such as automotive and aerospace. In addition, by reducing supply chain complexity, additive manufacturing can reduce emissions from transporting physical goods around the world. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many businesses are motivated to deploy additive manufacturing to improve production processes at-scale.
Many businesses faced with increased global competition and rapidly changing market preferences are turning to additive manufacturing to overcome the limitations of conventional manufacturing and provide a competitive advantage. According to an Ernst & Young global survey, 83% of industrial businesses in 2019 were either already applying or considering applying additive manufacturing technologies, a significant increase from 36% in 2016. According to the Wohlers Report 2020, spending on additive manufacturing products and services roughly doubled from $6 billion to $12 billion during this same period. While many businesses still value the rapid prototyping benefits of additive manufacturing, they are also eager to realize benefits largely related to end-use part production. According to Ernst & Young, over 50% of industrial businesses expect to use additive manufacturing to produce products that better meet customer requirements; reduce logistics efforts, transport and inventories; and manufacture existing products at lower costs.
Most existing additive manufacturing technologies primarily focus on design & prototyping applications.
Most commercially available 3D printers leverage legacy additive manufacturing technologies including fused filament fabrication, or FFF, stereolithography, or SLA, and PBF. These first-generation additive technologies build parts by tracing each layer using a single point or multiple points, such as an extrusion nozzle in FFF printers or a laser in SLA and PBF systems. While these technologies have evolved significantly since the early 2000s, they can typically only increase part throughput with additional time or systems, which limits customers’ ability to increase production without also increasing their equipment costs. Many existing additive manufacturing solutions consequently continue to focus on design and prototyping use cases or other low volume production applications where design flexibility and turnaround time are important to customers, but costs and throughput are not.
As a result, businesses still face hurdles in adopting legacy additive manufacturing for end-use production.
While the growth of additive manufacturing has accelerated in recent years, many companies still hesitate to fully adopt the existing, legacy technologies to produce end-use parts, preventing them from realizing the full benefits of additive manufacturing. Ernst & Young found that only 18% of industrial businesses in 2019 used additive manufacturing for end-use parts, lagging other use cases such as rapid prototyping. Because these existing, legacy technologies are better suited to design and prototyping applications, businesses pursuing additive manufacturing solutions face significant barriers to adopting these technologies for end-use applications. Using legacy additive manufacturing technologies to make end-use parts can be expensive, particularly for businesses under margin pressure. This is due to the high costs of legacy additive manufacturing equipment and related consumable materials, which are often priced at high levels by vendors to compensate for the low productivity of their systems. When combined with the limited throughput of these legacy additive manufacturing technologies, high upfront and operating costs result in part costs that typically cannot compete with conventional manufacturing. Consequently, business in industries that require inexpensive parts in large quantities, such as automotive and consumer products, face challenges in adopting additive manufacturing for end-use parts production.
​

As a result, we believe we are at the 

7



forefront of the next generation of companies that will drive the accelerated adoption of additive manufacturing for end-use parts, whereas legacy additive manufacturing technologies are primarily focused on enabling rapid prototyping. According to the Wohlers Report 2020 and management estimates, this market is expected grow from $12 billion in 2019 to $146 billion in 2030 at compound annual growth rate of approximately 25%, as additive manufacturing displaces conventional manufacturing across a growing range of applications.
​
Our Growth Strategy
​
The key elements of our strategy for growth include the following:
Expand our product offerings with a focus on integrated solutions that make additive manufacturing suitable for production applications and accessible to a broad audience.
We believe the adoption of additive manufacturing, particularly for end-use parts, is driven by the availability of solutions that offer a tool-free, digital path to producing large quantities of parts that are both higher performance and lower cost than achievable through conventional manufacturing processes. Our product portfolio includes additive manufacturing technologies designed for volume production, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in enhancing these solutions and developing technologies with breakthrough advances in print speed and other process parameters to deliver the highest throughput systems and lowest part costs in the additive manufacturing market. We believe that such improvements will encourage customer investment in additive manufacturing across a range of industrial applications and vertical markets where conventional manufacturing has customarily held cost and volume advantages. Improved system productivity and economics will expand our market opportunity and enable customers to enjoy the benefits of additive manufacturing at-scale, including lighter, more sustainable parts and a digital supply chain. Our solutions focused on volume production also enable us to capture recurring revenue streams through the sales of consumables and service contracts. We are also committed to lowering the barriers to adopting such additive manufacturing solutions by providing integrated, turnkey experiences that reduce workflow complexity and include all the software, hardware and materials required to produce end-use parts. To accomplish this, we intend to continue investing in software, materials and sintering technologies complementary to our 3D printers that enable ease of use and broad adoption across a wide set of customers with varying levels of experience with additive manufacturing.
Pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships
We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and/or equity investments in businesses that represent a strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy. We believe such transactions would allow us to accelerate market penetration of our additive manufacturing solutions by enabling expansion of our product portfolio, access to new markets, and a stronger value proposition for our customers while delivering margin improvements and increased customer lifetime value. We believe that because of our core focus on engineering and technology development as well as our unique distribution network, we will be able to integrate and drive adoption of new technologies and capabilities acquired via strategic transactions.
​
Qualify additional materials to reach new verticals and expand our addressable market
Our current product portfolio supports 3D printing using an array of materials, including Polyetheretherketone, or PEEK, and Polyetherketoneketone, or PEKK, composites, stainless steels, tool steels, low alloy steels, copper, precious metals and ceramics, and we are in the process qualifying additional materials for printing. Our metal additive manufacturing systems are designed using sintering-based, powder metallurgy processes, for which there are hundreds of metal alloys and ceramics with well-characterized and high-quality material properties. These powder metallurgy materials offer a broad set of materials for us to evaluate and qualify for use with our metal additive manufacturing solutions. Our Production System solutions also provide open platforms for customers to develop and print with specialized materials that are either proprietary to them or not included on our internal development roadmap. By qualifying additional industrial materials on our systems and enabling customers to do the same, we believe we can serve a broader customer base and address new applications and vertical markets, thereby expanding market share of our solutions and helping drive adoption of additive manufacturing.
Establish a robust parts-as-a-service offering

8



We envision establishing a parts-as-a-service offering in which we directly manufacture parts for sale to our customers with a focus on key applications and verticals in which additive manufacturing can provide significant performance and cost advantages relative to conventional manufacturing. This offering will enable us to provide a more holistic suite of solutions for our customers. For example, providing parts-as-a-service enables customers to leverage our technology with a lower initial capital expenditure investment before bringing their production in-house when they are ready to purchase our additive manufacturing systems. We believe such services will facilitate lead generation for our additive manufacturing systems at-scale and enable high-performance and specialized applications using new materials ahead of broader market introduction. In addition, as we expand our use of innovative business models such as hardware-as-a-service, in which we provide customers access to our systems on a limited time basis for a recurring annual subscription fee, a parts-as-a-service offering will enable us to leverage depreciated additive manufacturing systems returned by customers upgrading to a newer generation of systems. To date we have not recognized any material revenues from either the parts-as-a-service or the hardware-as-a-service business models.
Extend our distribution channels and reach
We have a leading global distribution network consisting of over 265 resellers, covering more than 60 countries around the world. We intend to extend this distribution network by adding further geographic coverage and sales capacity as well as developing industry-specific expertise to drive penetration in vertical markets such as automotive, aerospace, medical and dental, and consumer products. We also expect to continue building out a high-velocity sales channel for lower price point products, such as Fiber, by partnering with additional volume distributors of software and hardware as well as expanding our internal sales infrastructure and online sales presence. To augment the reach of our distribution network, we intend to grow our direct sales efforts focused primarily on selling our higher priced solutions and serving major accounts and expanding our footprint within multinational and Fortune 500 organizations.
Build a diverse, global customer base
We believe that our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop a diverse, global customer base to reduce risks associated with revenue concentration in any single geographic region or industry. Our customers today include businesses of all sizes, ranging from small and medium enterprises to Fortune 500 organizations and span many industries and applications, including aerospace, automotive, consumer products, medical devices, heavy industry, and research and development. We aim to leverage our global distribution network to reach new customers broadly as well as opportunities in targeted industries and geographies. We believe this diversification will also allow us to identify new applications for which our solutions are appropriate and provide us with customer feedback to assist our product development efforts and ensure we are addressing a broad range of market needs.
Promote awareness through training and education
As businesses increasingly embrace additive manufacturing over the next decade, we intend to educate the market on best practices for adoption of the technology across the entire product life cycle. Our leadership position provides a platform to deliver this education both for our existing customers and the market as a whole. Such education is a critical component of our sales and marketing efforts. We believe businesses that are well-informed or that have firsthand experience of the benefits of our additive manufacturing solutions relative to conventional manufacturing are more likely to purchase and expand their use of our products and services over time. To drive such awareness, we are developing rich additive manufacturing content and curricula for delivery through both online and in-person media, including classes, programs, certifications, and professional services.

Differentiated and proprietary technology platform
We have invested significant resources in developing proprietary technologies across hardware, software and materials science to accelerate the widespread adoption of additive manufacturing. These technologies serve as the foundation of our additive manufacturing solutions. Our key print process innovations include:

• | Single Pass Jetting, or SPJ. A powder metallurgy-based process in which all the sequential steps of conventional binder jetting are combined and applied with each pass of a single print carriage, leading to significant increases in printer throughput and improvements in part costs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bound Metal Deposition, or BMD. A powder metallurgy-based process in which loose powders and dangerous lasers commonly associated with 3D printing are eliminated in favor of bound metal rods to shape parts layer-by-layer, leading to reductions in requirements for special facilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Micro Automated Fiber Placement, or Micro AFP. A process in which tape pre-impregnated with continuous fiber, or continuous fiber prepreg tape, is deposited along a part’s critical load paths in combination with chopped fiber filament to build high-strength and high-resolution parts with aerospace- and industrial-grade materials. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to these process innovations, we have developed purpose-built, proprietary sintering technology that delivers industrial-strength sintering in an office-friendly package as well as breakthrough sintering process simulation software. These fundamental technologies represent the cornerstones of our future product introductions and are critical to enhancing our existing offerings. Elements of these technologies and processes are protected by our know-how and by over 202 patents or pending patent applications.
Broad product portfolio
Every organization has a different challenge or application that drives its consideration of additive manufacturing. We offer our customers a range of solutions spanning multiple price points, materials, throughput levels, operating environments, and technologies to enable businesses to find the solution that solves their specific pain point and achieves their goals. Our broad product portfolio covers a spectrum of use cases, scaling with customer needs from entry-level, office-friendly additive manufacturing systems for low volume production of metal or composite parts to high-end, industrial additive manufacturing systems for mass production of low-cost metal parts. In addition, it eliminates the need for customers to source products for different applications from multiple third-party vendors, giving us a market advantage relative to competitors with a more limited set of solutions.
High printer throughput
We believe that our proprietary SPJ technology and each of our binder jet product platforms enables the highest rate of metal parts production among competing additive manufacturing systems for a given layer resolution. The Production System P-50, which is designed to achieve print speeds of up to 12,000 cubic centimeters per hour at a 65-micron printed layer height, can enable customers to manufacture up to hundreds of thousands or even millions of parts per year using additive manufacturing, unlocking new applications due to improved part costs and enhanced design flexibility. Our additive manufacturing solutions employ additional, proprietary technology innovations as a means to overcome some of the challenges that arise with high-speed metal 3D printing and ensure part consistency and accuracy. Through continued advances in underlying hardware and our own technology and processes, we believe that our products’ print speeds will continue to increase, driving down the cost of parts produced on our additive manufacturing systems. This will further differentiate our solutions from competitors while also improving our ability to compete with conventional manufacturing processes at larger quantities of parts and across a wider range of applications.
Integrated, turnkey solutions
We provide our customers with easy-to-use and end-to-end, turnkey solutions for additive manufacturing without the need for additional third-party equipment. We believe our compelling user experience across our product portfolio begins with cohesive and modern software applications for efficient printer build preparation and communication with our additive manufacturing systems, which receive feature enhancements via over-the-air or offline firmware updates.

​
Our Product Platforms
​
​
Production System
Created by leading inventors of binder jetting and single-pass inkjet technology, Production System technology is designed to be the fastest way to 3D print metal parts at scale. The Production System platform consists of two printer models. The P-1, which began commercial shipments in the fourth quarter of 2020, is a small form factor solution for process and materials development and serial production applications. The P-50, which is scheduled to begin commercial shipments in 2021 and is operational at select early customers today, is a large form factor mass production solution for end-use parts.
Both the Production System P-1 and P-50 leverage our patented SPJ technology, which can achieve print speeds up to 12,000 cubic centimeters per hour at a 65-micron printed layer height. SPJ represents a significant step forward from conventional binder jetting, which uses multiple carriages to complete the steps required to print each layer, including depositing, spreading, and compacting a thin layer of powder in a “build box” and then depositing and drying liquid binding agent, or binder, in the regions that will form parts. The sequential nature of this conventional process adds time per layer and reduces productivity. SPJ consolidates 

11



these steps into the motion of a single print carriage over the build box while advance binder chemistry eliminates the drying step. As a result, SPJ dramatically reduces print time and increases mechanical efficiency. In addition, the Production System P-50 print carriage features a mirrored design that allows it to print bi-directionally, removing wasted motion during printing and delivering speeds up to 100 times those of legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies. This throughput advantage is reinforced by an open material platform on both Production System models that allows customers to use low-cost, third-party metal injection molding, or MIM, powders. As a result, the Production System P-50 can produce parts at costs competitive with conventional mass production techniques such as casting or MIM for quantities up to hundreds of thousands of units. In addition, the Production System platform enables the re-use of reclaimed metal powder, resulting in near zero waste and further improving part costs.
The Production System platform also leverages other proprietary innovations to ensure accuracy and reliability at high print speeds, including:

• | Constant wave spreading. During printing, the Production System maintains a constant powder wave in front of printhead carriage, designed to ensure uniform layer thickness and density throughout the entire build box and resulting in more consistent parts within each build. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anti-ballistics technology. Using patented technology, the Production System maintains a controlled environment below the printhead to minimize binder and powder particle splash back, which can occur during high-speed printing, designed to drastically reduce variability in the printing process while increasing the longevity of the printhead. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real-time optical bed inspection. An overhead camera monitors each layer to determine print defects and nozzle performance during printing, facilitating part inspection and detects when automated printhead cleaning is required, minimizing and preventing part defects within each build. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inert processing environment. The Production System operates using an inert, chemically inactive processing environment across the printer and auxiliary processing equipment, including the powder processing unit and powder station. This enables support for a range of both non-reactive and reactive metals in a controlled fashion while also promoting consistent characteristics and quality across printed parts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Production System benefits include:

• | Excellent part quality. The Production System’s 1200 dots per inch, or DPI, native printhead works in conjunction with constant wave spreading technology to enable the production of dense, high-quality parts capable of performing in the most demanding end-use applications. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive part costs. Customers can achieve part costs competitive with conventional mass production techniques as a result of the Production System’s high-speed 3D printing combined with the ability to densely nest many parts in a single build and support for low-cost MIM powders readily available from third parties. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leading repeatability. Leveraging patented anti-ballistics technology and real-time optical print bed inspection, the Production System is designed to achieve the robust repeatability required to operate on the factory floor and produce end-use parts at-scale. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wide material compatibility. An inert processing environment, open material platform, and array of proprietary binders enable the Production System to support a variety of metals, ranging from stainless steels to reactive metals and high-performance super alloys. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shop System
The Shop System introduces high-quality binder jetting to the machine shop market. With the Shop System, businesses can reliably produce serial batches of complex, end-use metal parts in a fraction of the time and cost of conventional manufacturing and comparably priced additive manufacturing technologies.

12



Shipping commercially since the fourth quarter of 2020, the Shop System prints using a single-pass binder jetting architecture, in which a high-resolution, page-wide printhead deposits binder in a single pass over the build box and a separate carriage is used for powder spreading.

Studio System
The Studio System platform is designed for office-friendly 3D printing. We introduced Studio System 2 in February 2021 as the second generation of this platform. Integrated through Desktop Metal’s cloud-based Fabricate software, this turnkey solution delivers a streamlined and automated workflow for producing complex metal parts in-house via additive manufacturing.
The Studio System 2 leverages our proprietary BMD technology, a powder metallurgy-based additive manufacturing process in which loose powders and dangerous lasers associated with legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies are eliminated in favor of bound metal rods extruded through a nozzle to shape parts layer-by-layer. BMD minimizes requirements for special facilities or expensive EHS equipment as compared to legacy technologies and improves ease-of-use while enabling new features such as use of closed-cell triply periodic minimal surface, or TPMS, infill for lightweight strength. The Studio System 2 consists of two key components, the printer and furnace, each of which has been designed in-house for simple installation and ease-of-use. In addition, the furnace, which is fully-automated and sized to fit through ADA-compliant doors, is built using proprietary technology that provides industrial-strength, vacuum-enabled sintering in an office friendly package, designed to ensure uniform heating and cooling without the residual stresses introduced into parts by legacy PBF additive manufacturing processes, which can result in poor part performance. Parts produced using the Studio System 2 also feature our patented Separable Supports technology, which enables simplified post-processing and support removal relative to legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies.
Key Studio System 2 benefits include:

• | High-quality parts. Users can easily 3D print difficult-to-machine parts with up to 98% density and featuring excellent surface finish and complex geometry like undercuts and internal channels. Fabricate software automates complicated metallurgical processes to produce high-quality parts with densities and feature accuracy similar to casting. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy to use. Designed to simplify the otherwise complicated powder metallurgy process, the Studio System 2 is built to make 3D printing metal parts as easy as uploading a design to Fabricate software and pressing print with no guesswork or manual calculations required. Material changeovers are quick and easy, enabled by our unique, hot-swappable material cartridge design. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designed for the office. The Studio System 2 is designed to seamlessly integrate 3D printing into design and engineering workflows. By eliminating lasers, loose metal powders, and liquid solvents, the system is easy to use in a team’s work environment with no third-party equipment and minimal facilities investment required.

Fiber
Shipping since the fourth quarter of 2020, Fiber is the world’s first desktop 3D printer to fabricate high-resolution parts with aerospace- and industrial-grade continuous fiber composite tape materials used in industrial Automated Fiber Placement, or AFP, processes. Based on our breakthrough Micro AFP technology, customers can now print parts with a superior level of strength and stiffness and in a broad range of materials that traditionally required expensive, industrial AFP systems.
During the Micro AFP process, one Fiber printhead deposits a continuous fiber prepreg tape along critical load paths of a part to build dense, reinforced sections while a second printhead extrudes chopped fiber filament to build a high-resolution exterior shell. The materials used to make the resulting parts are up to two times stronger than steel at one-fifth its weight and up to 75 times stiffer and 60 times stronger than standard FFF polymer materials such as Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, or ABS. To switch between the printheads, Fiber uses a robotic tool changer architecture, which enables future expandability and can store up to four tools, including additional FFF heads for different materials or future enhancements.
Key Fiber benefits include:

• | Strong parts. Fiber combines the ease-of-use and strong surface finish of FFF printing with the exceptional performance of continuous fiber tape prepreg with high fiber loading and the ability to be layered in multiple orientations based on specific loading conditions, resulting in high-strength parts for demanding applications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wide range of materials. To enable a broad set of applications from consumer electronics to automotive, Fiber supports a wide range of fiberglass and carbon fiber-reinforced composites, including PEEK, PEKK, and Nylon (Polyamide 6, or “PA6”) composites, which exhibit excellent mechanical properties, are temperature, chemical, and corrosion resistant, and electrostatic discharge, or ESD, compliant. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accessible to all. With its easy-to-use platform featuring both entry-level and advanced software settings, and affordable annual subscription pricing models, Fiber offers high-quality composite 3D printing starting at an accessible price point.

In addition, depending on the product, our consumables may include wear components for our additive manufacturing systems, which require replacement after a specified usage amount or in accordance with predetermined replacement cycles, in order to maintain the proper operations of the equipment.
Software
Software is a key component of our additive manufacturing solutions and is at the core of their accessibility and ease-of-use. Built on cloud, desktop, and mobile technologies, our build preparation software, Fabricate, streamlines the process of setting up prints and provides a cohesive, modern user interface and experience across our product portfolio. In addition to basic features such as automatic support generation, part scaling and positioning, Fabricate also enables the unique features of each of our additive manufacturing systems, such as the ability to configure the quantity, placement, and orientation of continuous fiber tape for Fiber, to adjust closed-cell infill for the Studio System, and to densely nest multiple parts into a build for the Shop System and Production System platforms. The software natively reads commonly used 3D CAD file formats as well as traditional 3D printing file formats, such as STLs.
Our systems each feature onboard, color touchscreen controls and a user-friendly experience consistent with Fabricate. For our cloud-enabled systems, these onboard controls facilitate remote over-the-air updates delivered directly to the equipment, allowing for continuous improvement via new features and enhancements.
In addition, we are developing Live Sinter, a proprietary sintering process simulation software designed to improve part accuracy, reduce sintering support structures and associated costs and minimizing printing trial and error for powder metallurgy-based additive manufacturing processes. We introduced Live Sinter to customers in late 2020 as a companion software product for our Shop System and Production System solutions prior to broader commercialization efforts. This software dynamically simulates the results of the sintering process by leveraging a GPU-accelerated, multi-physics engine in combination with finite element analysis, or FEA, and artificial intelligence. It also automates the compensation of geometries for the distortion and shrinkage that typically occurs during sintering, further optimizing the printing process to create high-accuracy parts.
