Item 1. Business
Overview
CarLotz operates a consignment-to-retail used vehicle marketplace that provides our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers of used vehicles with the ability to easily access the retail sales channel. Our mission is to create the world’s greatest vehicle buying and selling experience. We operate a technology-enabled buying, sourcing and selling model that offers an omni-channel experience and diverse selection of vehicles. Our proprietary technology provides our corporate vehicle sourcing partners with real-time performance metrics and data analytics along with custom business intelligence reporting that enables vehicle triage optimization between the wholesale and retail channels. 
Our consignment model facilitates the sale of a vehicle by individuals and businesses alike. For our consignment partners we offer a physical location to display the vehicle, detailing, photography, marketing, a degree of separation between the seller and buyer, and the consumer confidence associated with a national dealership. Our asset-light model is designed to allow us to obtain vehicles through consignment, thereby limiting capital risk, as those vehicles consigned to us for sale (as opposed to purchased vehicles) are still owned by our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers.
We offer our products and services to (i) corporate vehicle sourcing partners, (ii) retail sellers of used vehicles and (iii) retail customers seeking to buy used vehicles. Our corporate vehicle sourcing partners include fleet leasing companies, vehicle rental companies, banks, finance companies, third-party remarketers, wholesalers, corporations managing their own fleets and OEMs. We offer our corporate vehicle sourcing partners a pioneering, Retail Remarketing™ service that is designed to fully integrate with their existing technology platforms. For individuals who are our retail sellers, our goal is to offer a hassle-free selling experience that allows them to stay fully informed by tracking the sale process through our easy to navigate online portal. Buyers can browse our inventory online through our website or at our locations as well as select from our integrated financing and insurance products with ease.
Founded in 2011, CarLotz currently operates twenty-two retail hub locations in the U.S., initially launched in the Mid-Atlantic region and since expanded to the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, West and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States. Our current facilities are located in Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington State. Generally, our hubs act as both physical showrooms with retail sales and as consignment centers where we can source, process and recondition newly acquired vehicles. With the aim of improving our operating and financial results, we are planning to pause our real estate growth efforts in 2022, except for one hub we expect to open in 2022. 
Inventory Sourcing
We source vehicles from both corporate and consumer sellers, auctions and other wholesale channels. We source vehicles non-competitively (i.e. vehicles sourced other than from auctions) through our consignment to retail sales model, through purchases directly from consumers and through arrangements with corporate vehicle sourcing partners. We also source vehicles competitively through purchase at auction, as necessary, to provide inventory at our newer hub locations, to round out our inventory and during periods of tight supply. 
We expect to maintain long-term sourcing relationships with a number of national accounts and to pursue sales from new accounts. We support our corporate vehicle sourcing partners by offering a technology platform designed to allow our supply partners to track the sale process of their vehicles in real-time, along with a custom system for managing customer leads and leads from third party providers. Our proprietary application includes a suite of tailored features designed to create value for sellers with tools for documenting and transmitting vehicle information.
We generally charge our retail sellers and some corporate vehicle sourcing partners a flat fee for our consignment services. In addition to our flat fee model, we also enter into alternative fee arrangements, such as profit sharing programs or programs with fees based on a return above a wholesale index. The profit sharing programs generally include arrangements where we share a percentage of vehicle sale proceeds and, in some cases, fees with our corporate sourcing partners. The programs with fees based on a return above a wholesale index generally include a payment above the wholesale price. Under these alternative fee arrangements, our gross profit for a particular unit could be higher or lower than the gross profit per unit we would realize under our flat fee pricing model depending on, among other things, the unit’s sale price, shipping and reconditioning costs, and fees we are able to charge in connection with the sale. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and, under arrangements with them, they are not required to make vehicles available to us. For these and other reasons, our volume and mix of vehicles from our corporate vehicle sourcing partners has fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate over time. In addition, our gross profit per unit has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate from 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

period to period, perhaps significantly, due to, among other reasons, our mix of competitively sourced and non-competitively sourced inventory, and the sales prices and fees we are able to collect on the vehicles.
We also have dealer owned inventory, which includes inventory purchased at wholesale auctions or purchased from consumers and our corporate partners, that operates in a similar manner to traditional used car dealers and which exposes us  directly to the effects of changes in vehicle prices (generally price depreciation) more directly than inventory sourced through consignment. 
Our gross profit per unit has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate from period to period, perhaps significantly, due to, among other things, our mix of competitively sourced and non-competitively sourced inventory, acquisition costs and the sales prices and fees we are able to collect on the vehicles.
Revenue Generation
CarLotz generates a significant majority of its revenue from contracts with retail customers related to the sales of vehicles. We sell used vehicles to our retail customers from our hubs located throughout the U.S. Customers also may trade-in their existing vehicle to apply toward the transaction price of a used vehicle, for which we generate revenue on the sale of a used vehicle to the customer trading-in their vehicle and on the traded-in vehicle when it is sold to a new owner. CarLotz generates revenue from providing retail vehicle buyers with options for financing, insurance, extended warranties, and other vehicle protection products; these services are provided by third parties that CarLotz either marks up or earns a commission based on our customers’ purchases. Since we do not control these products before they are transferred to the consumer, we recognize net commission revenue at the time of sale.
We also sell vehicles to wholesalers or other dealers, primarily at auctions. Generally, the vehicles sold through the wholesale channel are vehicles acquired via trade-in, acquired via consignment that do not meet our quality standards for sale to retail customers, vehicles that remain unsold at the end of the consignment period, retail vehicles that did not sell through the retail channel within a reasonable period of time, or vehicles that the Company determines offer greater financial benefit through the wholesale channel.
Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $258.5 million, $118.6 million, and $102.5 million, respectively. 
Regional Hub Network
Through our e-commerce website and twenty-two regional hubs, we aim to provide a shopping experience for today’s modern vehicle buyer, allowing our nationwide retail customers to transact online, in-person or a combination of both. We aim to offer a full-spectrum of inventory, including high-value and commercial vehicles, available for delivery anywhere in the U.S. Our regional hubs allow for test drives and on-site purchase. Our current facilities are located in Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington State.
Technology
We are constantly reviewing our technology platform, and our goal is to enhance our online platform for seamless end-to-end transactions and to continually enhance both the car buying and selling experience. Our B2B portal and integration framework are designed to support the assignment, re-conditioning, sale and remittance of vehicles from our corporate vehicle sourcing partners. 
Seasonality
Used vehicle sales generally experience seasonality with sales typically peaking late in the first calendar quarter of each year and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter. Used vehicle prices also historically have exhibited seasonality, with used vehicle prices declining at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year, all other factors being equal. 
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and other intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property (including our technology and confidential information) through a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as contractual commitments and security procedures. We generally require certain of our 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. We regularly review our technology development efforts and branding strategy to identify and assess the protection of new intellectual property. We own certain trademarks important to our business, such as the CarLotz trademark.
We currently hold rights to the “CarLotz.com” Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name CarLotz or are otherwise relevant to or descriptive of our business.
While software can be protected under copyright law, we have chosen to rely primarily on trade secret law in order to protect our proprietary software and have chosen not to register any copyrights in these works. In the United States, copyright must be registered in order to enforce certain rights. Therefore, the remedies and damages available to us for unauthorized use of our software may be limited.
Intellectual property laws, contractual commitments and security procedures provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary materials may be independently developed by our competitors or revealed to the public or our competitors and no longer provide protection for the related intellectual property. In addition, intellectual property laws vary from country to country, and we have not sought trademark registrations outside of the United States. We may therefore be unable to protect certain of our proprietary technology, brands or other intellectual property in other jurisdictions.
Government Regulation
Our business is and will continue to be subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The advertising, sale, purchase, financing and transportation of used vehicles is regulated by every state in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. We also are subject to state laws related to titling and registration and wholesale vehicle sales, and our sale of value-added products is subject to state licensing requirements, as well as federal and state consumer protection laws. These laws can vary from state to state. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our e-commerce business depends on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them, and we may face regulatory action if regulators believe that we are not in compliance with such obligations.
In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e-commerce and regulations and laws governing the collection, storage and use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunities Act and prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the FTC, the Department of Transportation, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products and the collection, storage and use of consumer personal information. Additionally, we are subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies. We also are subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.
State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles and add-on products, including financing, by dealers within their respective states. We are licensed as a dealer in Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington and all of our transactions are conducted under our respective state licenses.
Some states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All vehicle sale transactions and applicable retail installment financings are conducted under our dealer licenses. As we seek to expand our operations and presence into other states, we may be required to obtain additional finance or other licenses, and we may not be able to obtain such licenses within the timeframe we expect or at all.

In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the sale and financing of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information-reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. We are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and exchange listing rules.

Competition
The used vehicle market in the United States is highly competitive and fragmented. There are approximately 43,000 used vehicle dealers nationwide as well as a large number of transactions occurring in the peer-to-peer market. Competitors in the used vehicle market include:
•traditional used vehicle dealerships, including those that may increase investment in their technology and infrastructure or leverage original equipment manufacturing services to market and sell used vehicles online;
•large national car dealers, such as CarMax and AutoNation, which are expanding into online sales, including omni-channel offerings;
•on-line and physical auction businesses, such as ADESA (which recently signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Carvana, subject to customary closing conditions), Manheim, ACV, BackLotCars and several smaller independent auctions that compete with us for the supply of our vehicles;
•sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles that were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales;
•used car dealers or marketplaces with e-commerce business or online platforms such as Carvana, Vroom and Shift; and
•the peer-to-peer used vehicle sales market, utilizing sites such as Google, Facebook, Craigslist.com, eBay Motors and Nextdoor.com.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability and umbrella insurance in each of the states that we have operations.
All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers with financial ratings of A or better. We and our insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 492 employees. All of our teammates are paid via W-2 and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. Most of our staff are at-will employees that can terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry may be difficult to replace.
