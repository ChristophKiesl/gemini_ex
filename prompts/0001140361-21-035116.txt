Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a shock wave technology company using a patented system of noninvasive, high-energy, acoustic shock waves for regenerative medicine and other applications. Our initial focus is regenerative medicine utilizing noninvasive, acoustic shock waves to produce a biological response resulting in the body healing itself through the repair and regeneration of tissue, musculoskeletal, and vascular structures.
 
Our lead regenerative product in the United States is the dermaPACE® device, used for treating diabetic foot ulcers, which was subject to two double-blinded, randomized Phase III clinical studies. On December 28, 2017, the U.S. FDA granted the Company’s request to classify the dermaPACE® System as a Class II device via the de novo process.  As a result of this decision, the Company was able to immediately market the product for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) as described in the de novo request, subject to the general control provisions of the FD&C Act and the special controls identified in this order.
 
On August 6, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Celularity Inc. (“Celularity”) pursuant to which we acquired Celularity’s UltraMIST assets (“UltraMIST” or the “Assets”).  The UltraMIST® System provides through a fluid mist a low-frequency, non-contact, and pain free ultrasound energy deep inside the wound bed that promotes healing from within. The ultrasound acoustic waves promote healing by reducing inflammation and bacteria in the wound bed, while also increasing the growth of new blood vessels to the area.  The UltraMIST® System treatment must be administered by a healthcare professional.  This proprietary technology has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the promotion of wound healing through wound cleansing and maintenance debridement combined with ultrasound energy deposited inside the wound that stimulated tissue regeneration.
 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, on August 6, 2020, we entered into a license and marketing agreement with Celularity pursuant to which Celularity granted to us a license to the Celularity wound care biologic products, Biovance® and Interfyl® (the “License Agreement”). The License Agreement provides us with an exclusive license to use, market, distribute and sell Biovance® in the “Field” and “Territory” (each as defined in the License Agreement), and a non-exclusive license to use, market, distribute and sell Interfyl® in the Field in the Territory. The License Agreement has an initial five-year term, after which it automatically renews for additional one-year periods, unless either party gives written notice at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the current term.
 
Our portfolio of healthcare products and product candidates activate biologic signaling and angiogenic responses, including new vascularization and microcirculatory improvement, helping to restore the body’s normal healing processes and regeneration. We intend to apply our Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE®) technology in wound healing, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac conditions. The Company is marketing its dermaPACE® System for treatment usage in the United States and will continue to generate revenue from sales of the European Conformity Marking (CE Mark) devices and accessories in Europe, Canada, Asia,,Brazil , Mexico,  and Asia/Pacific.  The Company generates revenue streams from dermaPACE® treatments, product sales, licensing transactions and other activities, and with its recent acquisition of the UltraMIST® assets, SANUWAVE now combines two highly complementary and market-cleared energy transfer technologies used in the dermaPACE® and UltraMIST® Systems and two human tissue biologic products (Biovance® and Interfyl®), creating a platform of scale with an end-to-end product offering in the advanced wound care market.

      Our lead product candidate for the global wound care market, dermaPACE®, has received FDA clearance for commercial use to treat diabetic foot ulcers in the United States and the CE Mark allowing for commercial use on acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue. We believe we have demonstrated that our patented technology is safe and effective in stimulating healing in chronic conditions of the foot and the elbow through our United States FDA Class III Premarket Approvals (“PMAs”) approved OssaTron® device, and in the stimulation of bone and chronic tendonitis regeneration in the musculoskeletal environment through the utilization of our OssaTron, Evotron®, and orthoPACE® devices in Europe and Asia.
 
We are focused on developing our Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) technology to activate healing in:
 

• | wound conditions, including diabetic foot ulcers, venous and arterial ulcers, pressure sores, burns and other skin eruption conditions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | orthopedic applications, such as eliminating chronic pain in joints from trauma, arthritis or tendons/ligaments inflammation, speeding the healing of fractures (including nonunion or delayed-union conditions), improving bone density in osteoporosis, fusing bones in the extremities and spine, and other potential sports injury applications; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | plastic/cosmetic applications such as cellulite smoothing, graft and transplant acceptance, skin tightening, scarring and other potential aesthetic uses; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cardiac applications for removing plaque due to atherosclerosis improving heart muscle performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to healthcare uses, our high-energy, acoustic pressure shock waves, due to their powerful pressure gradients and localized cavitational effects, may have applications in secondary and tertiary oil exploitation, for cleaning industrial waters and food liquids and finally for maintenance of industrial installations by disrupting biofilms formation. Our business approach will be through licensing and/or partnership opportunities.
 
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus is expected to result in a global slowdown of economic activity which is likely to decrease demand for a broad variety of products, including from our customers, while also disrupting supply channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time until the disease is contained.  Also, the pandemic may cause continued or additional actions by hospitals and clinics such as limiting elective procedures and treatments and limiting clinical trial activities and data monitoring.  We expect all of these factors to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict.
 
We were formed as a Nevada corporation in 2004.  We maintain a public internet site at www.sanuwave.com.  The information on our websites is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are not incorporated by reference.
 
Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) Technology for Regenerative Medicine
 
Our PACE product candidates, including our lead product candidate, dermaPACE®, deliver high-energy acoustic pressure waves in the shock wave spectrum to produce compressive and tensile stresses on cells and tissue structures. These mechanical stresses at the cellular level have been shown in pre-clinical work to promote angiogenic and positive inflammatory responses, and quickly initiate the healing cascade. This has been shown in pre-clinical work to result in microcirculatory improvement, including increased perfusion and blood vessel widening (arteriogenesis), the production of angiogenic growth factors, enhanced new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and the subsequent regeneration of tissue such as skin, musculoskeletal and vascular structures. PACE procedures trigger the initiation of an accelerated inflammatory response that speeds wounds into proliferation phases of healing and subsequently returns a chronic condition to an acute condition to help reinitiate the body’s own healing response. We believe that our PACE technology is well suited for various applications due to its activation of a broad spectrum of cellular events critical for the initiation and progression of healing.

      High-energy, acoustic pressure shock waves are the primary component of our previously developed product, OssaTron, which was approved by the FDA and marketed in the United States for use in chronic plantar fasciitis of the foot in 2000 and for elbow tendonitis in 2003.  Previously, acoustic pressure shock waves have been used safely at much higher energy and pulse levels in the lithotripsy procedure (breaking up kidney stones) by urologists for over 25 years and has reached the care status of “golden standard” for the treatment of kidney stones.
 
We research, design, manufacture, market and service our products worldwide and believe we have already demonstrated that our technology is safe and effective in stimulating healing in chronic musculoskeletal conditions of the foot and the elbow through our United States FDA Class III PMA approved OssaTron device, and in the stimulation of bone and chronic tendonitis regeneration in the musculoskeletal environment through the utilization of our orthoPACE, Evotron and OssaTron devices in Europe, Asia and Asia/Pacific.
 
We believe our experience from our preclinical research and the clinical use of our predecessor legacy devices in Europe and Asia, as well as our OssaTron device in the United States, demonstrates the safety, clinical utility and efficacy of these products. In addition, we have preclinical programs focused on the development and better understanding of treatments specific to our target applications.
 
Currently, there are limited biological or mechanical therapies available to activate the healing and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue and vascular structures. As baby boomers age, the incidence of their targeted diseases and musculoskeletal injuries and ailments will be far more prevalent. We believe that our pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that our PACE technology will be effective in targeted applications.  We anticipate that future clinical studies should lead to regulatory approval of our regenerative product candidates in the Americas, Middle East and Africa.  If approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, we believe that our product candidates will offer new, effective and noninvasive (extracorporeal) treatment options in wound healing, orthopedic injuries, plastic/cosmetic uses and cardiovascular procedures, improving the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from injuries or deterioration of tissue, bones and vascular structures.
 
dermaPACE® – Our Lead Product Candidate
 
The FDA granted approval of our Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to conduct two double-blinded, randomized clinical trials utilizing our lead device product for the global wound care market, the dermaPACE® device, in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.
 
The dermaPACE® system was evaluated using two studies under IDE G070103. The studies were designed as prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled, multi-center 24-week studies at 39 centers. A total of 336 subjects were enrolled and treated with either dermaPACE® plus conventional therapy or conventional therapy (a.k.a. standard of care) alone. Conventional therapy included, but was not limited to, debridement, saline-moistened gauze, and pressure reducing footwear. The objective of the studies was to compare the safety and efficacy of the dermaPACE® device to sham-control application. The prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint for the dermaPACE® studies was the incidence of complete wound closure at 12 weeks post-initial application of the dermaPACE® system (active or sham). Complete wound closure was defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements, confirmed over two consecutive visits within 12-weeks. If the wound was considered closed for the first time at the 12-week visit, then the next visit was used to confirm closure. Investigators continued to follow subjects and evaluate wound closure through 24 weeks.
 

6
 
      Between the two studies there were over 336 patients evaluated, with 172 patients treated with dermaPACE® and 164 control group subjects with use of a non-functional device (sham). Both treatment groups received wound care consistent with the standard of care in addition to device application. Study subjects were enrolled using pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to obtain a homogenous study population with chronic diabetes and a diabetic foot ulcer that has persisted a minimum of 30 days and its area is between 1cm2 and 16cm2, inclusive. Subjects were enrolled at Visit 1 and followed for a run-in period of two weeks. At two weeks (Visit 2 – Day 0), the first treatment was applied (either dermaPACE® or Sham Control application). Applications with either dermaPACE® or Sham Control were then made at Day 3 (Visit 3), Day 6 (Visit 4), and Day 9 (Visit 5) with the potential for 4 additional treatments in Study 2. Subject progress including wound size was then observed on a bi-weekly basis for up to 24 weeks at a total of 12 visits (Weeks 2-24; Visits 6-17).
 
We retained Musculoskeletal Clinical Regulatory Advisers, LLC (MCRA) in January 2015 to lead the Company’s interactions and correspondence with the FDA for the dermaPACE®, which have already commenced. MCRA has successfully worked with the FDA on numerous Premarket Approvals (PMAs) for various musculoskeletal, restorative and general surgical devices since 2006.
 
Working with MCRA, we submitted to FDA a de novo petition on July 23, 2016. Due to the strong safety profile of our device and the efficacy of the data showing statistical significance for wound closure for dermaPACE® subjects at 20 weeks, we believe that the dermaPACE® device should be considered for classification into Class II as there is no legally marketed predicate device and there is not an existing Class III classification regulation or one or more approved PMAs (which would have required a reclassification under Section 513(e) or (f)(3) of the FD&C Act). On December 28, 2017, the FDA determined that the criteria at section 513(a)(1)(A) of (B) of the FD&C Act were met and granted the de novo clearance classifying dermaPACE® as Class II and available to be marketed immediately.
 
Finally, our dermaPACE® device has received the European CE Mark approval to treat acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue, such as in the treatment of pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and traumatic and surgical wounds. The dermaPACE® is also licensed for sale in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. Additionally our joint venture partner in Brazil, Diversa SA, received approval from the Brazilian Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (“National Health Surveillance Agency” or “ANVISA”) to market dermaPACE® to treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in Brazil.
 
We are actively marketing the dermaPACE® to the European Community, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Asia/Pacific, utilizing distributors in select countries.
 
Clinical Studies

A post-market pilot study to evaluate the effects of high energy focused, acoustic shock wave therapy on local skin perfusion and healing of DFUs was changed to a 15 patient case study with the same primary objective of determining the effects of high-energy focused, acoustic shock wave therapy on oxygen saturation levels was completed.  A near-infrared spectroscopy device was used to measure the oxygen saturation levels prior to treatment and after the full treatment regimen. Treatment with the dermaPACE® System resulted in all patients demonstrating a statistically significant increase in tissue oxygen saturation within the wound bed, a key component of wound healing.  Additionally, the results showed all 15 wounds demonstrated a decrease in wound area and seven of the wounds healed. The results of this case study are another indication that treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers with the dermaPACE® System prepares the wound bed via oxygenation and neo-vascularization, facilitating accelerated wound resolution via the body’s natural healing process or preparing the wound to more readily respond to other advanced healing modalities.

      UltraMIST - Ultra sound healing Therapy
 
UltraMIST is an FDA approved powerful, non-contact and non-thermal ultrasound therapy device used to promote wound healing.  UltraMIST is FDA approved to treat malaises such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous leg ulcers, deep tissue pressure injuries, and surgical wounds. Currently, the Company’s dermaPACE® is only approved to treat diabetic foot ulcer.
 
UltraMIST currently has over 900 customers in 46 states providing the Company with a robust product offering in the advanced wound care market and an end-to-end advanced wound care product portfolio that addresses the entire care pathway.
 
Biologic Products
 
BIOVANCE is a graft skin substitute product that provides a natural foundation for wound healing. The product is an allograft that is prepared from the amnion, the part of the amniotic sac closest to the developing embryo. Key cells and proteins move into the BIOVANCE material so that tissues can regenerate and wounds can continue to heal. The product is adaptable and flexible, it can conform to irregular surfaces. It is also adaptable in that it can be sutured or glued if determined by the clinician to be a better option. The product also has a 5-year shelf life at room temperature conditions and is available in multiple sizes for application flexibility.
Interfyl is a liquid product that replaces damaged integumental soft tissue and augments / supplements inadequate connective tissues. Interfyl is comprised of allogenic decellularized particulate human placental connective tissue matrix that is placed on a wound. The product repairs small surgical defects resulting from either medical or surgical conditions, including patients with exposed vital structures such as bone, tendon, ligament, or nerves. Interfyl is able to fill irregular spaces or soft tissue deficits resulting from trauma or surgery. The filler also allows for cell adherence and growth during tissue repair and affords structural support and elasticity in the tissue. The product is offered in a 1.5mL flowable format in a 3-mL syringe. 50mg and 100mg particulates are in each vial.
Growth Opportunity in Wound Care Treatment
 
We are focused on the development of products that treat unmet medical needs in large market opportunities. Our FDA approval in the United States for our lead product candidate, dermaPACE®, is the first step in providing an option to a currently unmet need in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetes is common, disabling and deadly. In the United States, diabetes has reached epidemic proportions. Based on our research, foot ulcerations are one of the leading causes of hospitalization in diabetic patients and lead to billions of dollars in health care expenditures annually.  According to a 2020 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on estimated 2018 data, approximately 34.1 million people aged 18 years or older (diagnosed and undiagnosed), roughly 13.0% of the United States population, have diabetes and 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 18 years or older.  In 2016, there were 7.8 million hospital discharges with diabetes as a listed diagnosis.  The estimated total direct and indirect costs of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2017 was $327 billion.  Between 2012 and 2017, medical costs per person associated with diabetes increased from $8,417 to $9,601.   Approximately 2 - 7% of diabetics will develop a DFU each year.  Foot ulcers are a significant complication of diabetes mellitus and often precede lower-extremity amputation. The most frequent underlying etiologies are neuropathy, trauma, deformity, high plantar pressures, and peripheral arterial disease. Over 50% of DFUs will become infected, resulting in high rates of hospitalization, increased morbidity and potential lower extremity amputation and up to 80% of DFUs that have healed will re-ulcerate within 12 months. According to the International Diabetes Federation 2019 Global Fact Sheet, approximately 463 million people has diabetes and 10% of global health expenditure is spent on diabetes (approximately $760 billion).

      A majority of challenging wounds are non-healing chronic wounds and in addition, chronic diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers are often slow-to-heal wounds, which often fail to heal for many months, and sometimes, for several years. These wounds often involve physiologic, complex and multiple complications such as reduced blood supply, compromised lymphatic systems or immune deficiencies that interfere with the body’s normal wound healing processes.  These wounds often develop due to a patient’s impaired vascular and tissue repair capabilities.  Wounds that are difficult to treat do not always respond to traditional therapies, which include hydrocolloids, hydrogels and alginates, among other treatments.  We believe that physicians and hospitals need a therapy that addresses the special needs of these chronic wounds with high levels of both clinical and cost effectiveness.
 
We believe we are developing a safe and advanced technology in the wound healing and tissue regeneration market with PACE.  dermaPACE® is noninvasive and does not require anesthesia, making it a cost-effective, time-efficient and painless approach to wound care.  Physicians and nurses look for therapies that can accelerate the healing process and overcome the obstacles of patients’ compromised conditions, and prefer therapies that are easy to administer.  In addition, since many of these patients are not confined to bed, healthcare providers want therapies that are minimally disruptive to the patient’s or the caregiver’s daily routines. dermaPACE’s noninvasive treatments are designed to elicit the body’s own healing response and, followed by simple standard of care dressing changes, are designed to allow for limited disruption to the patients’ normal lives and have no effect on mobility while their wounds heal.
 
Developing Product Opportunities - Orthopedic
 
The orthoPACE System, which is intended for use in orthopedic, trauma and sports medicine indications, continues to be a viable and effective treatment solution in Europe and South Korea.  The device features four types of applicators including a unique applicator that is less painful for some indications and may reduce or completely eliminate anesthesia for some patients.  In the orthopedic setting, the orthoPACE System is being used to treat tendinopathies and acute and nonunion fractures, including the soft tissue surrounding the fracture to accelerate healing and prevent secondary complications and their associated treatment costs
 
We believe there are significant opportunities in the worldwide orthopedic market, driven by aging baby boomers and their desire for active lifestyles well into retirement and the growth in the incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, diabetes and other diseases that cause injury to musculoskeletal tissues and/or impair the ability of the body to heal injuries.
 
We have experience in the sports medicine field (which generally refers to the non-surgical and surgical management of cartilage, ligament and tendon injuries) through our legacy devices, OssaTron and Evotron.  Common examples of these injuries include extremity joint pain, torn rotator cuffs (shoulder), tennis elbow, Achilles’ tendon tears and torn meniscus cartilage in the knee.  Injuries to these structures are very difficult to treat because the body has a limited natural ability to regenerate these kinds of tissues.  Cartilage, ligament and tendons seldom return to a pre-injury state of function.  Due to a lack of therapies that can activate healing and regenerate these tissues, many of these injuries will result in a degree of permanent impairment and chronic pain.  Prior investigations and pre-clinical work indicate that PACE can positively affect the body’s inflammatory process and activate various cell types and may be an important adjunct to the management of sports medicine injuries.  We plan to submit to U.S. FDA a 510(k) seeking clearance for general indications to address this growing field.

      Additionally, we have developed and introduced Profile by SANUWAVE as an immediately available solution for pain management in sports medicine and physical therapy in the U.S. market.  Profile by SANUWAVE is a therapeutic massager intended for the relief of minor muscle aches and pains via SANUWAVE’s Diffused Acoustic Pressure (DAP®) technology.  DAP® delivers the beneficial, therapeutic field of the acoustic pressure waves without the impact and potential pain of a focused pulse.  There is a significant need in the U.S. for pain management products and the non-invasive delivery of therapeutic shockwaves for its treatment can help to serve this market.
 
Non-Medical Uses for Our Shockwave Technology
 
We believe there are significant license/partnership opportunities for our acoustic pressure shockwave technology in non-medical uses, including in the energy, water, food, and industrial markets.
 
Due to their powerful pressure gradients and localized cavitational effects, we believe that high-energy, acoustic pressure shockwaves can be used to clean, in an energy efficient manner, contaminated fluids from impurities, bacteria, viruses, and other harmful micro-organisms, which provides opportunities for our technology in cleaning industrial and domestic/municipal waters.  Based on the same principles of action of the acoustic pressure shockwaves against bacteria, viruses, and harmful micro-organisms, we believe our technology can be applied for cleaning or sterilization of various foods such as milk, natural juices, and meats.
 
In the energy sector, we believe that the acoustic pressure shockwaves can be used to improve oil recovery (IOR), as a supplement to or in conjunction with existing fracking technology, which utilizes high pressurized water/gases to crack the rocks that trapped oil in the underground reservoir.  Through the use of our high-energy, acoustic pressure shockwaves the efficiency can be improved and in the same time the environmental impact of the fracking process can be reduced.  Furthermore, we believe our technology can be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) based on the changes in oil flow characteristics resulting from acoustic pressure shockwave stimulation, as a tertiary method of oil recovery from older oil fields.
 
Additionally, we demonstrated through three studies performed at Montana State University that high-energy, acoustic pressure shockwaves are disrupting biofilms and thus can be used for surface cleaning monuments, ship hulls, and underwater structure cleaning, or to unclog pipes in the energy industry (shore or off-shore installations), food industry, and water management industry, which will reduce or eliminate down times with significant financial benefits for maintenance of existing infrastructure.  Also, our technology should have a significant environmental impact by eliminating or reducing the use of harmful chemicals, which are the preferred biofilm cleaning method at this time.

      Market Trends
 
We are focused on the development of regenerative medicine products that have the potential to address substantial unmet clinical needs across broad market indications.  We believe there are limited therapeutic treatments currently available that directly and reproducibly activate healing processes in the areas in which we are focusing, particularly for wound care and repair of certain types of musculoskeletal conditions.
 
According to AdvaMed and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data from 2006 and our internal projections, the United States advanced wound healing market for the dermaPACE® is estimated at $20 billion, which includes diabetic foot ulcers, pressure sores, burns and traumatic wounds, and chronic mixed leg ulcers.  We also believe there are significant opportunities in the worldwide orthopedic and spine markets, driven by aging baby boomers and their desire for active lifestyles well into retirement and the growth in the incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, diabetes and other diseases that cause injury to orthopedic tissues and/or impair the ability of the body to heal injuries.
 
With the success of negative pressure wound therapy devices in the wound care market over the last decade and the recognition of the global epidemic associated with certain types of wounds, as well as deteriorating musculoskeletal conditions attributed to obesity, diabetes, vascular and heart disease, as well as sports injuries, we believe that Medicare and private insurers have become aware of the high costs and expenditures associated with the adjunctive therapies being utilized for wound healing and orthopedic conditions that have limited efficacies in full skin closure, or bone and tissue regeneration. We believe the wound healing and orthopedic markets are undergoing a transition, and market participants are interested in biological response activating devices that are applied noninvasively and seek to activate the body’s own capabilities for regeneration of tissue at injury sites in a cost-effective manner.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is focused on the research, development, and commercialization of our patented, non-invasive and biological response-activating medical systems for the repair and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures. Our end-to-end wound care portfolio of regenerative medicine products and product candidates help restore the body’s normal healing processes. SANUWAVE applies and researches its patented energy transfer technologies in wound healing, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic, and cardiac/endovascular conditions.
 
Through our August 2020 acquisition of the UltraMIST® System, we now combine two highly complementary and market-cleared energy transfer technologies used in the dermaPACE® and UltraMIST medical device Systems, which creates a platform of scale in the advanced wound care market.
 
Our the dermaPACE® device for treating diabetic foot ulcers, which was subject to two double-blinded, randomized Phase III clinical studies. On December 28, 2017, the U.S. FDA granted the Company’s request to classify the dermaPACE® System as a Class II device via the de novo process.  As a result of this decision, the Company was able to immediately market the product for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) as described in the de novo request, subject to the general control provisions of the FD&C Act and the special controls identified in this order.
 
Our portfolio of healthcare products and product candidates activate biologic signaling and angiogenic responses, including new vascularization and microcirculatory improvement, helping to restore the body’s normal healing processes and regeneration. We intend to apply our Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) technology in wound healing, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac conditions.
 
Our immediate goal for our regenerative medicine technology involves leveraging the knowledge we gained from our existing human heel and elbow indications to enter the advanced wound care market with innovative treatments.

      The key elements of our strategy include the following:
 

• | Commercialize and support the domestic distribution of our dermaPACE® device to treat diabetic foot ulcers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We initially focused on obtaining FDA approval in the United States for our lead product candidate, dermaPACE®, for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, which we believe represents a large, unmet need.
 
On December 28, 2017, the U.S. FDA granted the Company’s request to classify the dermaPACE® System as a Class II device via the de novo process.  As a result of this decision, the Company was able to immediately market the product for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) as described in the de novo request, subject to the general control provisions of the FD&C Act and the special controls identified in this order.
 
We began the commercialization of dermaPACE® in the United States in 2018 through strategic partnership and have continued commercialization in 2019 through placement of devices in doctors’ offices, wound care centers and hospitals by our internal sales team. For example, in February 2018, we entered into an agreement with Premier Shockwave Wound Care, Inc. (“PSWC”) and Premier Shockwave, Inc. (“PS”) for the purchase by PSWC and PS of dermaPACE® Systems and related equipment sold by us and granting PSWC and PS limited but exclusive distribution rights to provide dermaPACE® Systems to certain government healthcare facilities in exchange for the payment of certain royalties to us. PSWC is a related party since it is owned by A. Michael Stolarski, a member of the Company’s board of directors and an existing shareholder of the Company.
 

• | Develop and commercialize our noninvasive biological response activating devices in the regenerative medicine area for the treatment of skin, musculoskeletal tissue and vascular structures. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to use our proprietary technologies and know-how in the use of high-energy, acoustic pressure shock waves to address unmet medical needs in wound care, orthopedic, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac indications, possibly through potential license and/or partnership arrangements.
 

• | License and seek partnership opportunities for our non-medical acoustic pressure shock wave technology platform, know-how and extensive patent portfolio.

      Scientific Advisors
 
We have established a network of scientific advisors that brings expertise in wound healing, orthopedics, cosmetics, clinical and scientific research, and FDA experience.  We consult our scientific advisors on an as-needed basis on clinical and pre-clinical study design, product development, and clinical indications.
 
We pay consulting fees to certain members of our scientific advisory board for the services they provide to us, in addition to reimbursing them for incurred expenses.  The amounts vary depending on the nature of the services.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Following FDA approval in December 2017, we sought a development and/or commercialization partnership, or to commercialize the product ourselves domestically, including the commercialization of the assets obtained in the Asset Purchase Agreement with our internal sales force. Outside the United States, we retain distributors to represent our products in selective international markets. These distributors have been selected based on their existing business relationships and the ability of their sales force and distribution capabilities to effectively penetrate the market with our PACE product line. We rely on these distributors to manage physical distribution, customer service and billing services for our international customers. Three distributors and partners accounted for 18%, 15% and 12% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 0%, 0% and 22% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2019.
 
For a period of approximately three months following the August 6, 2020 Asset Purchase Agreement, we utilized the seller to fulfill certain customer orders and to collect related accounts receivable payments from customer orders that originated from the acquired business after August 6, 2020.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, orders fulfilled by the seller comprised approximately 49% of the Company’s 2020 full year revenues.  As of December 31, 2020, accounts receivable balances that originated from these seller-fulfilled orders constituted approximately 46% of accounts receivable balances, all of which were either reserved as of December 31, 2020 or subsequently collected during 2021.  No other distributors or partners made up more than 10% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 or more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivables as of December 31, 2020.
 
Manufacturing
 
We have developed a network of suppliers, manufacturers and contract service providers to provide sufficient quantities of our products.
 
We are party to a manufacturing supply agreement with Swisstronics Contract Manufacturing AG in Switzerland, a division of Cicor Technologies Ltd., covering the generator box component of our products. Our generator boxes are manufactured in accordance with applicable quality standards (EN ISO 13485) and applicable industry and regulatory standards. We produce the applicators and applicator kits for our products.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and selected foreign patent applications and United States and selected foreign trademark applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, products, and improvements that are important to the development of our business.  Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available.  The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
Patents
 
We consider the protection afforded by patents important to our business.  We intend to seek and maintain patent protection in the United States and select foreign countries, where deemed appropriate for products that we develop.  There are no assurances that any patents will result from our patent applications, or that any patents that may be issued will protect our intellectual property, or that any issued patents or pending applications will not be successfully challenged, including as to ownership and/or validity, by third parties.  In addition, if we do not avoid infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, we may have to seek a license to sell our products, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of intellectual property in court. Any current or future challenges to our patent rights, or challenges by us to the patent rights of others, could be expensive and time consuming.
 
We derive our patent rights, including as to both issued patents and “patent pending” applications, from three sources: (1) assignee of patent rights in technology we developed; (2) assignee of patent rights purchased from HealthTronics, Inc. (“HealthTronics”); and (3) as licensee of certain patent rights assigned to HealthTronics. In August 2005, we purchased a significant number of patents and patent applications from HealthTronics, to whom we granted back perpetual and royalty-free field-of-use license rights in the purchased patent portfolio primarily for urological uses.  We believe that our owned and licensed patent rights provide a competitive advantage with respect to others that might seek to utilize certain of our apparatuses and methods incorporating extracorporeal acoustic pressure shockwave technologies that we have patented.  However, we do not hold patent rights that cover all of our products, product components, or methods that utilize our products.  We also have not conducted a competitive analysis or valuation with respect to our issued and pending patent portfolio in relation to our current products and/or competitor products.
 

14
 
      We are the assignee of thirty-one issued United States patents and thirty-eight issued foreign patents that are not expired, which on average have remaining useful lives of ten years with the longest useful life extending to 2039.  Our current issued United States and foreign patents include patent claims directed to particular electrode configurations, piezoelectric fiber shockwave devices, chemical components for shockwave generation, reflector geometries, medical systems general construction, and software architecture for licensing processes.  Our United States patents also include patent claims directed to methods and devices such as our products for using acoustic pressure shockwaves to treat ischemic conditions, spinal cord scar tissue and spinal injuries, bone fractures and osteoporosis, blood sterilization, stem cell stimulation, tissue cleaning, and within particular treatment parameters using personalized medical treatments for diabetic foot ulcers or pressure sores or venous ulcers or arterial ulcers or acute skin conditions.  Also, we have a significant number of US and international patents related to the extracorporeal or intracorporeal use of shockwaves or pressure waves for cardiovascular field (plaque removal, elimination of occlusions, treatment of heart tissue ischemia, to name a few).  While such patented method and device claims may provide patent protection against certain indirect infringing promotion and sales activities of competing manufacturers and distributors, certain medical methods performed by medical practitioners or related health care entities or methods executed by industrial operators may be subject to exemption from potential infringement claims under 35 U.S.C. § 287(c) and, therefore, may limit enforcement of claims of our medical and non-medical method patents as compared to device construction patents.
 
We also currently maintain fourteen United States non-provisional patent applications and nineteen foreign patent applications.  Our patent-pending rights include inventions directed to certain shockwave devices and systems, ancillary products, and components for acoustic pressure shockwave treatment devices, and various methods of using acoustic pressure shockwaves in both medical and non-medical applications.  The medical patent-pending methods include, for example, using acoustic pressure shockwaves to treat soft tissue disorders, bones, joints, wounds, skin, blood vessels, lymphatic disorders, cardiac tissue, fat and cellulite, lung tissue, or to facilitate vaccination, and for the use of shockwaves in combination with other energy medical technologies.  In the non-medical field, the use of acoustic pressure shockwaves for blood and fluids sterilization, to destroy different pathogens from installation and different devices, to process fluids, meat and dairy products and to clean transport pipes.  All of our United States and foreign pending applications either have yet to be examined or require response to an examiner’s office action rejections and, therefore, remain subject to further prosecution, the possibility of further rejections and appeals, and/or the possibility we may elect to abandon prosecution, without assurance that a patent may issue from any pending application.
 
Under our license to HealthTronics, we reserve exclusive rights in our purchased portfolio as to orthopedic, tendonopathy, skin wounds, cardiac, dental, neural medical conditions and to all conditions in animals (Ortho Field).  HealthTronics receives field-exclusive and sublicensable rights under the purchased portfolio as to (1) certain HealthTronics lithotripsy devices in all fields other than the Ortho Field, and (2) all products in the treatment of renal, ureteral, gall stones and other urological conditions (Litho Field). HealthTronics also receives non-exclusive and non-sublicensable rights in the purchased portfolio as to any products in all fields other than the Ortho Field and Litho Field. Refer to section “Contractual Obligations” for information on the default of our loan with HealthTronics.
 

15
 
      Pursuant to mutual amendment and other assignment-back rights under the patent license agreement with HealthTronics, we are also a licensee of certain patents and patent applications that have been assigned to HealthTronics.  We received a perpetual, non-exclusive and royalty-free license to nine issued foreign patents. Our non-exclusive license is subject to HealthTronics’ sole discretion to further maintain any of the patents and pending applications assigned back to HealthTronics.
 
As part of the sale of the veterinary business in June 2009, we have also granted certain exclusive and non-exclusive patent license rights to Pulse Veterinary Technologies, LLC for most of our patent portfolio issued before 2009 to utilize acoustic pressure shockwave technologies in the field of non-human mammals.
 
Given our international patent portfolio, there are growing risks of challenges to our existing and future patent rights.  Such challenges may result in invalidation or modification of some or all of our patent rights in a particular patent territory and reduce our competitive advantage with respect to third party products and services. Such challenges may also require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
 
If we become involved in future litigation or any other adverse intellectual property proceeding, for example, as a result of an alleged infringement, or a third party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, including treble damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation or lengthy governmental proceedings and could divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous, if available at all.
 
Trademarks
 
Since other products on the market compete with our products, we believe that our product brand names are an important factor in establishing and maintaining brand recognition.
We have the following trademark registrations: SANUWAVE® (United States, European Community, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan and under the Madrid Protocol), dermaPACE® (United States, European Community, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Canada, Brazil and under the Madrid Protocol), angioPACE® (Australia, European Community and Switzerland), PACE® - Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (United States, European Community, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Canada), orthoPACE® (United States and European Community), DAP® - Diffused Acoustic Pressure (United States and European Community), and Profile® (United States, European Community and Switzerland).  Our newest trademark is Energy First™ (United States), Healing Today, Curing Tomorrow™ (United States), and UltraMIST™ (United States).
 
Through the acquisition of UltraMIST/MIST assets from Celularity, now SANUWAVE is the owner of the Celleration® (United States, Australia, Europe, and Japan), Proven Healing® (Madrid Protocol), MIST Ultrasound Healing Therapy & Design (United States), MIST® (United States), MIST Therapy® (United States), and MIST & Design (United States) registered trademarks.
 
We also maintain trademark registrations for: OssaTron® (United States and Germany), Evotron® (Germany and Switzerland), Evotrode® (Germany and Switzerland), Orthotripsy® (United States). We phased out the Reflectron® (Germany and Switzerland) and Reflectrode® (Germany and Switzerland), evoPACE® (Australia, European Community and Switzerland) trademarks, due to the fact that Reflectron® and Reflectrode® products are no longer available for sale in any market and evoPACE® is a product that was never commercialized.

      Potential Intellectual Property Issues
 
Although we believe that the patents and patent applications, including those that we license, provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and medical device companies are highly complex and uncertain.  The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Our success will depend in part on us not infringing on patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors, as well as our ability to enforce our patent rights.  We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products and product candidates, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  In enforcement proceedings in Switzerland, we assisted HealthTronics as an informer of misappropriation by a Swiss company called SwiTech and related third parties of intellectual property rights in legacy proprietary software and devices relating to assets we purchased from HealthTronics in August 2005.  As a result of this action, SwiTech was forced into bankruptcy.  We also pursued the alleged misappropriation by another Swiss company called SwiTalis and related third parties of intellectual property rights in legacy proprietary software and devices relating to assets we purchased from HealthTronics in August 2005. In 2016, SwiTalis claimed copyright rights on the High Voltage Modules that were used in our devices and the old line of Pulse Vet devices during the manufacturing process at Swisstronics in Switzerland. At this time, however, no such court action against Swisstronics is pending in Switzerland and we believe that it is unlikely that SwiTalis will pursue their earlier allegations against Swisstronics and, indirectly, us.  In 2017, we abandoned our action against SwiTalis.  There can be no assurance, however, that future claims or lawsuits against us may not be brought, and such present or future actions against violations of our intellectual property rights may result in us incurring material expense and divert the attention of management.
 
Third parties that license our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, patented technology or copyrighted material, may also take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.  In addition, the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, patents, and similar proprietary rights.
 
We collaborate with other persons and entities on research, development, and commercialization activities and expect to do so in the future. Disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights in know-how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our collaborators, researchers, licensors, licensees and consultants. In addition, other parties may circumvent any proprietary protection that we do have.  As a result, we may not be able to maintain our proprietary position.
 
Competition
 
We believe the advanced wound care market can benefit from our technology which up-regulates the biological factors that promote wound healing. Current medical technologies developed by Acelity (formerly Kinetic Concepts, Inc.), Organogenesis, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Derma Sciences, Inc., MiMedx Group, Inc., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Molnlycke Health Care, and Systagenix Wound Management (US), Inc. (now owned by Acelity) manage wounds, but, in our opinion, do not provide the value proposition to the patients and care givers like our PACE technology has the potential to do. The leading medical device serving this market is the Vacuum Assisted Closure (“V.A.C.”) System marketed by KCI. The V.A.C. is a negative pressure wound therapy device that applies suction to debride and manage wounds.
 

17
 
      There are also several companies that market extracorporeal shockwave device products targeting lithotripsy and orthopedic markets, including Dornier MedTech, Storz Medical AG, Electro Medical Systems (EMS) S.A., and CellSonic Medical which could ultimately pursue the wound care market. Nevertheless, we believe that the dermaPACE® System has a competitive advantage over all of these existing technologies by achieving wound closure by means of a minimally invasive process through innate biological response to PACE technology.
 
Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major pharmaceutical companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products.  Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve widespread market acceptance.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
FDA Regulation
 
Each of our products must be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies.  FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products.
 
In the United States, the FDA subjects medical products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or to allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.
 
The FDA has determined that our technology and product candidates constitute “medical devices.” The FDA determines what center or centers within the FDA will review the product and its indication for use, and also determines under what legal authority the product will be reviewed.  For the current indications, our products are being reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. However, we cannot be sure that the FDA will not select a different center and/or legal authority for one or more of our other product candidates, in which case the governmental review requirements could vary in some respects.
 

18
 
      FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

• | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (510(k)), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, and post market surveillance, and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval (PMA) application.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of our product candidates require FDA authorization prior to marketing, by means of either a 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing.  In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence.  After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, then a company must submit and the FDA must approve a PMA before marketing can begin.
 
In the past, the 510(k) pathway for product marketing required only the proof of significant equivalence in technology for a given indication with a previously cleared device. Currently, there has been a trend of the FDA requiring additional clinical work to prove efficacy in addition to technological equivalence.  Thus, no matter which regulatory pathway we may take in the future towards marketing products in the United States, we will be required to provide clinical proof of device effectiveness.
 
Within the past few years, the FDA has released guidelines for the FDA’s reviewers to use during a product’s submission review process.  This guidance provides the FDA reviewers with a uniform method of evaluating the benefits verses the risks of a device when used for a proposed specific indication.  Such a benefit/risk evaluation is very useful when applied to a novel device or to a novel indication and provides the FDA with a consistent tool to document their decision process.  While intended as a guide for internal FDA use, the public availability of this guidance allows medical device manufacturers to use the review matrix to develop sound scientific and clinical backup to support proposed clinical claims and to help guide the FDA, through the decision process, to look at the relevant data. We intend to use this benefit/risk tool in our FDA submissions.
 

19
 
      A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data.  Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing.  If the FDA determines the application or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.  During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians, is likely to be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision. While the FDA often follows the panel’s recommendation, there have been instances where the FDA has not.  If the FDA finds the information satisfactory, it will approve the PMA.  The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies post-approval.  Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 
During the review of either a PMA application or 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. We cannot be sure that our product candidates will be approved or cleared in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us.
 
Obtaining medical device clearance, approval, or licensing in the United States or abroad can be an expensive process. The fees for submitting an original PMA to the FDA for consideration of device approval are substantial. Fees for supplement PMA’s are less costly but still can be substantial.  International fee structures vary from minimal to substantial, depending on the country.  In addition, we are subject to annual establishment registration fees in the United States and abroad.  Device licenses require periodic renewal with associated fees as well.  In the United States, there is an annual requirement for submitting device reports for Class III/PMA devices, along with an associated fee. Currently, we are registered as a Small Business Manufacturer with the FDA and as such are subject to reduced fees. If, in the future, our revenues exceed a certain annual threshold limit, we may not qualify for the Small Business Manufacturer reduced fee amounts and will be required to pay full fee amounts.
 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
 
One or more clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and more recently are becoming necessary to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or un-cleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements.  If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an IDE application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.  The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board (IRB) has approved the study.
 

20
 
      During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 
However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our ability to enroll and treat patients in clinical trials and to monitor data at our clinical trial sites.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply.  These include:
 

• | the FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post market surveillance, including documentation of clinical experience and also follow-on, confirmatory studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements, as are our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and contract testing laboratories.
 
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Exported devices may also fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Commerce/Bureau of Industry and Security and compliance with export regulations may be required for certain countries.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.  The manufacturing facility for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before we can use it. We and some of our third party service providers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.
 

21
 
      International Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements.  The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
 
The primary regulatory environment in Europe is the European Union, which consists of 27 member states encompassing most of the major countries in Europe.  In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Union Commission have determined that dermaPACE®, orthoPACE, OssaTron and Evotron will be regulated as medical device products.  These devices have been determined to be Class IIb devices.  These devices are CE Marked and as such can be marketed and distributed within the European Economic Area.
 
The primary regulatory body in Canada is Health Canada. In addition to needing appropriate data to obtain market licensing in Canada, we must have an ISO 13485 certification, as well as meet additional requirements of Canadian laws.  We currently maintain this certification. We maintain a device license for dermaPACE® with Health Canada for the indication of “devices for application of shock waves (pulsed acoustic waves) on acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue”.
 
The primary regulatory bodies and paths in Asia and Australia are determined by the requisite country authority.  In most cases, establishment registration and device licensing are applied for at the applicable Ministry of Health through a local intermediary. The requirements placed on the manufacturer are typically the same as those contained in ISO 9001 or ISO 13485.
 
The primary regulatory body in Brazil is ANVISA, all medical devices imported into or distributed within Brazil must first undergo registration with ANVISA. Once ANVISA makes its final decision on registration applications, the result is published in Brazil’s Official Diary. In addition to ANVISA, our products require additional certification via INMETRO. We currently hold a Class II device licenses in BRAZIL for dermaPACE® and is in the process of registering our UltraMIST product line
 
European Good Manufacturing Practices
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with cGMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device.  The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications.  In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
 

22
 
      United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the United States, there are Federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and state laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials. Although we intend to structure our future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of our products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of our business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenge by Federal or state enforcement officials under these laws.
Third Party Reimbursement
 
We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of the products we commercialize will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, and workers’ compensation plans.  These third party payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for a product or therapy, in whole or in part, if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. The third party payers also may place limitations on the types of physicians or clinicians that can perform specific types of procedures. In addition, third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third party payers must also pre-approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been approved or cleared by the FDA for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until adequate reimbursement has been obtained from governmental and private third party payers.
 
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures. There can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
In the United States, some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month, and consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use products, including ours.
 
One of the components in the reimbursement decision by most private insurers and governmental payers, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare, is the assignment of a billing code.  Billing codes are used to identify the procedures performed when providers submit claims to third party payers for reimbursement for medical services.  They also generally form the basis for payment amounts.  We will seek new billing codes for the wound care indications of our products as part of our efforts to commercialize such products.

      The initial phase of establishing a professional billing code for a medical service typically includes applying for a CPT Category III code for both hospital and in-office procedures.  This is a tracking code without relative value assigned that allows third party payers to identify and monitor the service as well as establish value if deemed medically necessary. The process includes CPT application submission, clinical discussion with Medical Professional Society CPT advisors as well as American Medical Association (AMA) CPT Editorial Panel review. A new CPT Category III code will be assigned if the AMA CPT Editorial Panel committee deems it meets the applicable criteria and is appropriate.  In 2017, we applied for two, new CPT Category III codes for extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in wound healing.  These codes were published by AMA/CPT for use beginning January 1, 2019.
 
The secondary phase in the CPT billing code process includes the establishment of a permanent CPT Category I code in which relative value is analyzed and established by the AMA. The approval of this code, is based on, among other criteria, widespread usage and established clinical efficacy of the medical service.
 
There are also billing codes that facilities, rather than health care professionals, utilize for the reimbursement of operating costs for a particular medical service.  For the hospital outpatient setting, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services automatically classified the new ESWT wound healing CPT Category III codes into interim APC groups. The APC groups are services grouped together based on clinical characteristics and similar costs.  An APC classification does not guarantee payment.
 
We believe that the overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. In addition, recent healthcare reform measures, as well as legislative and regulatory initiatives at the Federal and state levels, create significant additional uncertainties. There can be no assurance that third party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis.  The unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Confidentiality and Security of Personal Health Information
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use or disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of HHS, the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has published regulations to address the privacy (the “Privacy Rule”) and security (the “Security Rule”) of protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA also requires that all providers who transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and to standardize national provider identification codes. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) enacted the HITECH Act, which extends the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates for a violation, establishes new requirements to notify the Office for Civil Rights of HHS of a breach of HIPAA, and allows the Attorneys General of the states to bring actions to enforce violations of HIPAA. Rules implementing various aspects of HIPAA are continuing to be promulgated.
 
We anticipate that, as we expand our dermaPACE® business, we will in the future be a covered entity under HIPAA.  We intend to adopt policies and procedures to comply with the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the HIPAA statute as such regulations become applicable to our business and as such regulations are in effect at such time.

      In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule described above, we may become subject to state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient health information. These laws vary widely. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against us for a violation of a state’s privacy laws. We intend to adopt policies and procedures to ensure material compliance with state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information as such laws become applicable to us and to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws on an ongoing basis.
 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to extensive Federal, state, provincial and municipal environmental statutes, regulations and policies, including those promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Environment Canada, Alberta Environment, the Department of Health Services, and the Air Quality Management District, that govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges into air and water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes.  Some of these statutes and regulations impose strict liability for the costs of cleaning up, and for damages resulting from, sites of spills, disposals, or other releases of contaminants, hazardous substances and other materials and for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at properties leased or operated by us and at off-site locations where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.  In addition, we may be subject to claims and lawsuits brought by private parties seeking damages and other remedies with respect to similar matters.  We have not to date needed to make material expenditures to comply with current environmental statutes, regulations and policies. However, we cannot predict the impact and costs those possible future statutes, regulations and policies will have on our business.
Employees
 
As of October 11, 2021, we had a total of 43 full time employees in the United States.  Of these, eight were engaged in research and development which includes clinical, regulatory and quality. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
