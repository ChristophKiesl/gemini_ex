Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing small molecule product candidates that target lysine-specific demethylase-1, or LSD1, an enzyme that plays a central role in the production of blood cells in the bone marrow. We are focused on improving the quality of life of patients with cancer and bone marrow diseases in addition to prolonging their lives. Our lead product candidate is bomedemstat for the treatment of certain myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs, a family of related, chronic cancers of the bone marrow. The three most common MPNs are myelofibrosis, or MF, essential thrombocythemia, or ET, and polycythemia vera, or PV.

We have completed enrollment for a Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat for the treatment of MF. We are currently enrolling patients in two Phase 2 clinical trials of bomedemstat, one for the treatment of ET and a second in an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of PV. To enable the collection of long-term safety and pharmacodynamic data, we initiated a Phase 2 Extension Study in 2021 into which patients from our Phase 2 clinical trials in MF and ET will transition. In our Phase 2 clinical trial in ET through November 1, 2021, interim and unaudited data from 37 patients demonstrates that a significant proportion of patients achieved a platelet count in the normal range within eight weeks, a primary clinical objective. In our Phase 2 clinical trial in MF through October 31, 2021, interim and unaudited data from 89 patients demonstrates that bomedemstat has resulted in improvements in patient symptoms, reductions in spleen volume and reduction in mutant allele frequency, or MAF, the proportion of blood cells with mutations that drive this disease. We believe bomedemstat has the potential to address unmet medical need in MF as a monotherapy as well as in combination with inhibitors of Janus-associated kinases. Bomedemstat has been generally well-tolerated in both ET and MF patients in these trials. We are pursuing the development of bomedemstat as a potentially disease-modifying therapy in ET and MF to address the limitations of currently approved therapies. Based on the current rate of enrollment for the Phase 2 clinical trial in ET, we expect to achieve alignment with the FDA for a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for ET in 2022, with the first patient dosed thereafter. In addition, in 2022, we will continue to support an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat in combination with ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with MF.
 
LSD1, discovered in 2004, is one of over one hundred known epigenetic proteins that regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of proteins, RNA and DNA. LSD1 regulates the maturation of blood stem cells and is essential for the differentiation of progenitor cells into mature megakaryocytes and granulocytes. Given the critical role that LSD1 plays in the function of malignant blood cells, targeting LSD1 for the treatment of blood cancers offers a new mechanism for the treatment of diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality. While LSD1 is rarely mutated in cancer, elevated levels of wild-type LSD1 are common in many blood cancers and solid tumors and correlate with a poor prognosis in high-risk prostate and breast cancer patients. In published animal studies, inhibiting LSD1 has had potent anti-tumor effects in cancer models including those for acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, prostate cancer and breast cancer. In addition, inhibiting LSD1 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, or a BCL-2 inhibitor such as venetoclax, has been shown to stop the growth of tumor cells, in contrast to the limited activity of either compound alone.
 
We are also developing bomedemstat and other novel LSD1-targeting product candidates for additional indications in areas of high unmet medical need. We are supporting an ongoing investigator-sponsored trial evaluating bomedemstat in patients with PV who have failed at least one standard therapy. Additionally, we aim to evaluate novel LSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, or SCD, and thalassemia.
 
Our Pipeline
 
Our current pipeline of product candidates targeting LSD1 in various blood cancers, and the next anticipated milestones, are summarized in the chart below.




 Our Team
 
Since our founding in 2012, we have been focused on discovering and developing small-molecule inhibitors of LSD1. Hugh Y. Rienhoff, Jr., M.D., our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, previously served as Chief Executive Officer of FerroKin BioSciences, a company focused on hemoglobinopathies, until its acquisition by Shire Pharmaceuticals. Along with Dr. Rienhoff, we have assembled a highly experienced team in small molecule drug discovery and clinical development as well as developing therapeutics for hemoglobinopathies and cancer. The efforts to date in developing inhibitors for LSD1 have resulted in a set of insights and capabilities that have allowed us to achieve significant progress.
Our Strategy
 
We are developing internally-discovered novel inhibitors of LSD1 to improve the quality of life of patients with cancer and bone marrow diseases in addition to prolonging their lives. In order to achieve this vision, key elements of our strategy include:

∎ | Advancing Bomedemstat to Regulatory Approval for Essential Thrombocythemia

 
By managing elevated platelets, the primary risk factor for thrombosis in ET, we believe bomedemstat has the potential to address a poorly met need in the 20% of ET patients who are intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea, the current standard-of-care. In our Phase 2 clinical trial in ET as of November 1, 2021, bomedemstat has been generally well tolerated, and a significant proportion of patients achieved a platelet count in the normal range within eight weeks. We continue to enroll patients in this trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2022. To enable the collection of long-term safety and pharmacodynamic data, we initiated a Phase 2 Extension Study in 2021 into which patients from our Phase 2 clinical trials MF and in ET will transition. We have recently held preliminary discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, about key trial design parameters for a registration-directed Phase 3 program of bomedemstat for the treatment of ET. Based on these discussions, we believe a two-arm trial comparing bomedemstat to best available therapy to evaluate the normalization of hematologic parameters in the absence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic events may provide the basis for regulatory approval for the second-line treatment of ET. Based on the current rate of enrollment for the Phase 2 clinical trial in ET, we expect to receive FDA clearance for a registrational Phase 3 pivotal program in 2022, with the first patient dosed thereafter. With positive results from the pivotal clinical program, we would expect to submit applications for regulatory approval with the FDA and the EMA for ET.
    
∎ | Advancing Bomedemstat to Regulatory Approval for Myelofibrosis

 
We believe there is significant unmet need for a disease modifying therapy, particularly in the initial addressable patient population of patients with MF whose disease is not adequately managed with ruxolitinib. We completed enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat monotherapy in patients with advanced MF as of May 17, 2021. To enable the collection of long-term safety and pharmacodynamic data, we initiated a Phase 2 Extension Study in 2021 into which patients from our Phase 2 clinical trials in MF will transition. Bomedemstat has been generally well-tolerated and resulted in improvements in patient symptoms, reductions in spleen volume, and reduction in MAF. We believe these encouraging data support continued clinical development of bomedemstat.


In addition, in 2022, we will continue to support an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of bomedemstat in combination with ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with MF. This trial will include both patients with MF who have not received any prior treatment, as well as those currently receiving ruxolitinib, but not achieving adequate symptom control or spleen volume reduction.
 
Based upon the results from our ongoing monotherapy and contemplated combination clinical trials, we intend to have discussions with the FDA about the endpoints and control arm for a registrational Phase 3 program in MF. Following these discussions, we may choose to initiate such a program. With positive results from the pivotal clinical program, we would expect to submit an NDA seeking regulatory approval from the FDA and an MAA from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for MF.
    
∎ | Developing Bomedemstat and Other Novel LSD1-Targeting Product Candidates for Additional Indications, Including Polycythemia Vera, Hemoglobinopathies and Solid Tumors

 
LSD1 inhibition modulates the proliferation of malignant blood cells and we believe it therefore represents a viable therapeutic approach to treating PV, an MPN characterized by the excessive production of red blood cells. While there are some available treatments for PV, namely, phlebotomy for low-risk patients and hydroxyurea for high-risk patients, there are no therapies that cure or modify the disease course. We believe bomedemstat represents a novel therapeutic option for this patient population; as an LSD1 inhibitor, the product candidate has the potential to address the significant unmet need for a disease-modifying therapy. An ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial is evaluating bomedemstat in patients with PV who have failed at least one standard therapy.
 
In addition, we aim to evaluate novel LSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as SCD and thalassemia. Defects in adult hemoglobin can contribute to such hemoglobinopathies. Fetal hemoglobin, which normally shuts off shortly after birth, can compensate for these defects, however, and inhibition of LSD1 has been shown to induce the production of fetal hemoglobin in pre-clinical studies. Thus, we plan to develop novel LSD1 inhibitors designed to enhance fetal hemoglobin production sufficient to achieve clinical benefit in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Lead optimization and pre-clinical studies are ongoing, and the next milestone for this program would be to nominate a clinical candidate.
 
We believe LSD1 inhibition may have utility in the treatment of solid tumors, especially in combination with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1 or anti-PDL-1 antibodies. We will support an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of bomedemstat in combination with atezolizumab for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in 2022.

Finally, we are developing novel LSD1-inhibiting molecules that inhibit the catalytic activity of LSD1 without disturbing other functions of LSD1 such as its ability to bind specific transcription factors or proteins associated with the scaffold function of LSD1 such as DNA methyltransferase 1, or DNMT1, which can associate with LSD1. We believe these compounds may have biological effects distinct from that of bomedemstat, and hence, distinct clinical uses. We are currently engaged in lead discovery of small molecules that target LSD1 in such a manner that may have activity in pre-clinical models of hematologic and non-hematologic diseases.
    
∎ | Retaining Rights and Maximizing the Value of our LSD1 Portfolio

 
We currently own worldwide rights to bomedemstat, as well as our pipeline of novel, internally-discovered LSD1 inhibitors in pre-clinical development. We plan to retain the rights to our programs to maximize the therapeutic potential of our pipeline and to allow for selective engagement in terms of entering into strategic partnerships.
 
LSD1
 
LSD1 was discovered in 2004 and plays a central role in the production of blood cells in the bone marrow. This enzyme removes methyl groups from a specific amino acid, lysine, on a specific histone known as histone H3. Experiments that selectively reduce or eliminate the function of LSD1 have demonstrated that the enzyme regulates the proliferation of blood stem cells and is essential for the differentiation of progenitor cells into mature bone marrow cells such as megakaryocytes and granulocytes. Megakaryocytes produce platelets and are thus the key cell in the pathology of ET. In addition, they produce inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that drive many MPN signs and symptoms. Animal studies have shown that LSD1 inhibition can limit the self-renewal potential of malignant blood-forming stem cells, thereby reducing the proportion of mutant cells. By reducing the mutant cells in patients with MPNs, LSD1 inhibition may result in improved survival in these patients. Given the critical role that LSD1 plays in the function of malignant blood cells, targeting LSD1 for the treatment of blood cancers offers a new mechanism for the treatment of diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality. LSD1 is also believed to play a role in neuronal survival and the development of dendritic spines, specialized structures in the brain that contribute to memory formation, hence, avoiding inhibition of LSD1 in the brain may be clinically desirable.




   

While LSD1 is rarely mutated in cancer, elevated levels of wild-type LSD1 are common in many blood cancers and solid tumors and are correlated with poor prognosis in high-risk prostate and breast cancer.
 
The potential therapeutic effect of inhibiting LSD1 has been observed in models of a variety of cancers and bone marrow diseases. Based on published animal studies, inhibiting LSD1 has had potent anti-tumor effects in cancer models including those for AML, prostate cancer and breast cancer. In addition, inhibiting LSD1 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, or the BCL-2 inhibitor such as venetoclax, has been shown to stop the growth of tumor cells, in contrast to the limited activity of either compound alone.
 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
 
MPNs are a family of related, chronic cancers of the bone marrow. The three main MPNs are ET, MF and PV. Hallmarks of these neoplasms are inflammation and bone marrow scarring in MF, increased platelet count in ET and increased red cell mass in PV.
    

Common symptoms of the MPNs include fatigue, itching, weight loss, night sweats, fever, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and discomfort due to spleen enlargement, bruising and stroke, all of which can be devastating and debilitating. Patients with ET and PV can progress to MF, and all MPN patients have a risk that their cancer transforms into AML, which has a median survival of five months.
 
The MPNs generally arise from mutations in the blood-forming stem cells of the bone marrow. The genes most commonly mutated in MPNs are Janus-associated kinase 2, or JAK2, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene, or MPL, and calreticulin, or CALR. These mutations alter the amino acid composition of these proteins in such a way that they constitutively activate the signaling pathways that regulate the production of all blood cells. Mutations that result in the continuous activation of the JAK-STAT pathway stimulate excess production of red cells, white cells, platelets, and inflammatory hormones.
 



Myelofibrosis
 
MF is the MPN associated with the shortest median survival from the time of diagnosis — approximately five years. Based on published epidemiology and our internal estimates, we believe the prevalence of MF in the United States is approximately 18,000 to 20,000 patients.
 
Among the MPNs, the constitutional symptoms of MF place the greatest burden on the patient’s quality of life. These generalized symptoms are typical of other chronic inflammatory conditions and include fatigue, night sweats, severe itching, weight loss and loss of appetite. Although many newly diagnosed patients with MF have elevated platelets or white blood cells, as the disease progresses, the bone marrow becomes increasingly scarred and unable to produce normal levels of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients subsequently develop spleen enlargement, or splenomegaly, as a compensatory, but ultimately futile, response to produce additional platelets, and red or white blood cells. Splenomegaly is the hallmark clinical feature of MF, though the size of the spleen has no bearing on survival. The most common causes of death in patients with MF are leukemia (31%), progression to frank bone marrow failure (18%), other complications such as neoplasia (17%), thrombosis and cardiovascular complications (13%), and infection (11%).
 
To date, no pharmacologic treatment has been shown to stop the progression of MF. The only curative treatment is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, replacing a patient’s blood-forming stem cells with those of a donor, an option limited to younger patients with less advanced disease and access to a donor.
 
Based on the large number of patients with MF who lose the clinical benefit of approved agents and the limited ability of these therapies to slow the progression of MF, we believe there remains a substantial unmet need for new therapies that can reduce symptoms in patients with MF, modify the progression of the disease, improve patient quality of life, reduce the rate of transformation to AML and/or prolong survival.
 
Ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, is approved for the treatment of disease-related symptoms and splenomegaly in adult patients with MF and PV. The drug is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis in the rest of the world. Ruxolitinib is effective at reducing symptoms and spleen size in many patients. However, ruxolitinib suppresses the formation of all types of blood cells, known as cytopenia. As a result, the dose of ruxolitinib often needs to be reduced, over time, in order to minimize anaemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia which compromises the clinical benefit in terms of spleen volume reduction and symptom relief. In addition, ruxolitinib treatment carries a risk of serious infection due to immunosuppression. We believe approximately one-third of patients with MF in the United States are currently receiving ruxolitinib based on public data provided by Incyte.
 
Ruxolitinib was approved in 2011 for the treatment of MF based on the results from two randomized Phase 3 clinical trials that demonstrated that a statistically significant proportion of patients experienced a reduction in spleen volume of 35% or greater, or SVR35, as assessed by imaging at 24 weeks, as well as reduction in symptom burden by 50% or greater, or TSS50, at week 24, a key secondary endpoint. SVR35 and TSS50 have since become accepted definitions of clinical response by the FDA and EMA and both have served as a primary endpoint for pivotal clinical trials in MF.
 
Although ruxolitinib is effective in reducing spleen volumes and improving symptoms, there are limitations to its use. According to a meta-analysis, over 40% of patients had stopped using ruxolitinib after three years. Fibrosis in the marrow in most patients is largely unaffected by treatment with the drug. Based on genetic analysis of blood cells, there is no durable decrease in the frequency of mutant cells that harbor the JAK2 mutation, the most common acquired mutation associated with MF. Ruxolitinib is also an immunosuppressive agent associated with opportunistic infectious diseases. Finally, ruxolitinib has been associated with the development of lymphoid tumors. We believe these data suggest ruxolitinib as monotherapy is neither long-term disease-modifying nor curative treatment option.
 
Fedratinib is the second approved drug for MF in the United States on the basis of spleen volume reduction. Like ruxolitinib, fedratinib is a JAK inhibitor. The FDA approval includes a “black box” warning of the potential for encephalopathy. In addition, according to the package insert, gastrointestinal toxicities were seen in 66% of patients in the fedratinib Phase 3 trials. We believe this toxicity and tolerability profile relegates fedratinib to later lines of therapy.
 
Before the approval of ruxolitinib and fedratinib, the standard of care for MF was hydroxyurea, although not approved for that indication. Hydroxyurea is a nonspecific suppressor of the formation of blood cells, is associated with a host of side effects and can cause new mutations in blood stem cells, potentially enhancing the risk of transformation to AML. Pegylated interferon-α can reduce splenomegaly and MAF but is associated with significant toxicities including cytopenias and neurotoxicities. Other drugs such as busulfan are occasionally used off-label for the treatment of MF despite significant toxicities and side effects.
 
Essential Thrombocythemia
 

The common mutations constitutively activating the JAK-STAT pathway in MF, those in JAK2, CALR and MPL, are also responsible for ET. Based on published epidemiology and our internal estimates, we believe the prevalence of ET in the United States is between 80,000 and 100,000 patients. Median survival for newly diagnosed patients is approximately 18 years.
 
The hallmark clinical feature of ET is an abnormally high platelet count as defined by a platelet count greater than 450,000 per microliter of blood, or 450 x 109/L, with many patients having platelet counts in excess of 1,000 x 10/L. The risk of blood clots, causing heart attacks and strokes, as well as haemorrhage increases with the platelet count. Furthermore, patients with ET have a significant risk of developing MF or AML. In addition, patients with ET can experience symptoms including weakness, headache and other symptoms caused by poor circulation such as burning and tingling in the hands and feet, that can reduce patients’ quality of life.
 
The main treatment goal for patients with ET is to reduce the risk of bleeding or clots by lowering platelet levels to the normal range. About half of the total ET patient population are classified as lower risk patients. These are patients less than 60 years old, with lower but elevated platelet counts and without a history of clotting events. These patients are generally treated with aspirin alone. The other half of patients with ET carry a higher risk of clotting and bleeding and, hence, are recommended for cytoreductive therapy. To lower blood counts, these patients are generally treated with hydroxyurea although it is not approved for the treatment of ET in the United States. Hydroxyurea does not alter the underlying progressive nature of the disease process leading in some patients to MF or AML. Furthermore, based on peer-reviewed literature, we believe approximately 20% of higher-risk ET patients are either intolerant of hydroxyurea, or are unable to achieve adequate reduction in platelet counts with this drug. A second treatment alternative, anagrelide is approved in the United States for the treatment of ET. It, however, is not widely used due to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. Various formulations of interferon are used for the treatment of ET. No other drugs are commonly used for the treatment of ET in the United States or Europe. Current treatment practice and patient flow are summarized in the diagram below.
 


Current treatment practice and patient flow in ET
 
Based on the substantial number of higher-risk ET patients in need of treatment alternatives, we believe there is a significant unmet need for new ET therapies that can effectively reduce patient platelet levels without general bone marrow suppression while slowing the progression of the underlying disease.
 
Discovery and Clinical Development of Bomedemstat
 
Bomedemstat is our internally-discovered, clinical-stage, small molecule inhibitor product candidate designed to inhibit LSD1. We discovered bomedemstat by starting with the publicly available crystal structure of LSD1 and known inhibitors of monoamine oxidases. We designed and synthesized a series of novel analogues to optimize the selective inhibition of LSD1 as determined by enzyme and cellular assays. Because of the function of LSD1 in the brain, we have also incorporated structural elements in bomedemstat in an effort to minimize crossing the blood-brain barrier. Through these efforts, we identified bomedemstat as having the potential to show the desired specificity, selectivity and potency to advance into pre-clinical development. Furthermore, all three of our pre-clinical studies evaluating the genotoxicity of bomedemstat were negative.
 
We tested bomedemstat in several mouse models of MPNs as a single agent. In these models, bomedemstat reduced splenomegaly, lowered excess white cells and platelets, reduced inflammatory cytokines and reduced the mutant cell population. For example, in mouse models of MF with the same JAK2 mutation frequently found in MPN patients resulting in the activated JAK2V617F protein, bomedemstat significantly increases survival as compared to the untreated group.
 


Effect of bomedemstat on survival in mutant mouse model of myelofibrosis
 
In the same mutant mouse model of MF, the combination of bomedemstat and ruxolitinib achieved significant white blood cell, or WBC, and spleen reduction at lower doses than either alone. The combination, however, had no greater impact on platelet counts than bomedemstat alone. We believe these results suggest the combination of bomedemstat and ruxolitinib may represent an opportunity for improved treatment of some patients with MPNs by enhancing the clinical response without increasing associated toxicities including lowering of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
 
Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Results in Phase 1 Trial of Bomedemstat in AML Patients
 
Our first clinical trial of bomedemstat enrolled 45 patients with relapsed or refractory AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS. Treatment with oral doses of bomedemstat of up to six milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day for up to 21 days was generally well-tolerated with no observed dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics supporting once-daily dosing. Dose-limiting toxicities are serious toxicities related to bomedemstat that would limit the dose or the duration of treatment in the intended patient population. The daily doses of bomedemstat currently used in clinical trials in ET and MF are approximately one-tenth of the highest dose used in our clinical trials in AML and MDS.
Clinical Development of Bomedemstat for Essential Thrombocythemia
 
We are currently enrolling patients in an international, single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat for the treatment of ET. We expect to reach target enrollment of approximately 60 patients in 2022. To be eligible for the Phase 2 ET trial, patients must be intolerant of, or inadequately managed by treatment with a standard-of-care drug, generally hydroxyurea, and also have one or more high-risk prognostic factors, such as being over 60 years of age or having a history of clotting or bleeding events. Primary endpoints of this clinical trial are safety and tolerability, as well as the reduction of platelet count to ≤400 x 109/L, in the absence of any clotting or bleeding events. We are also evaluating several exploratory endpoints, including reduction in MAF and prevention of transformation to MF or AML. In this Phase 2 trial, as well as our Phase 2 MF trial, we have used platelet count as a biomarker of bomedemstat activity on megakaryocyte function, allowing for individualized dosing. Patients from this trial will eventually transition into a Phase 2 Extension Study initiated in 2021 enabling the collection of long-term safety and pharmacodynamic data.

As of the November 1, 2021 cut-off date, 37 patients had enrolled in this clinical trial, of which 75% were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea, 11% were resistant to or intolerant of anagrelide, 8% were resistant or intolerant of interferon, and 3% each were resistant to or intolerant of ruxolitinib or busulfan. Thirty percent of these patients had received at least two previous treatments for ET. After a 14- to 28-day washout of prior ET treatment, the mean platelet and white blood cell counts at baseline were 863 x 109/L and 9.4 x 109/L, respectively, as of the cut-off date.
 
As of the cut-off date, of the 27 patients treated for at least 12 weeks, the change in platelet count was -48% from baseline, and 14 patients (52%) achieved 12 consecutive weeks with a platelet count of ≤400 x 109/L. All patients had stable hemoglobin levels. Based upon the MPN10, 55% of patients who had clinically meaningful symptoms at baseline (TSS ≥10), experienced a symptom reduction of >50% at week 24 (N=11) as of the cut-off date.
 
11


As of the cut-off date, 335 AEs were reported in thirty-three (89%) patients. The most common non-hematologic AEs were dysgeusia (49%), constipation (32%), arthralgia and fatigue (each reported by 24%). There have been eight SAEs, two of which were deemed related to bomedemstat by the Investigator (thrombocytopenia and mouth haemorrhage). One unrelated thrombotic SAE (pulmonary embolism) was reported. There have not been any dose-limiting toxicities or deaths related to drug as of the data cut-off date.

The interim and unaudited data as of the data cut-off date on the effects on platelet count, white blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels for these patients are shown in the graphs below. As of the cut-off date, treatment with bomedemstat has been shown to lower platelet levels to normal levels in most patients within eight weeks.
 
Furthermore, elevated white blood cells have been reduced to normal levels (less than 10 x 109/L) in many patients. In addition, bomedemstat has not been shown to lower hemoglobin significantly, or, by extension, cause anaemia.

Interim and unaudited data from ongoing Phase 2 trial in ET: Effect of bomedemstat on individual platelet counts
 

Interim and unaudited data from ongoing Phase 2 trial in ET: Effect of bomedemstat on white blood cell count and hemoglobin
 
By addressing the primary clinical feature of ET, elevated platelets, we believe bomedemstat could, if approved, become the standard of care for patients with ET who are intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea, the current mainstay of treatment for this disease. Furthermore, if we are able to demonstrate reduction in MAF or a reduced rate of transformation to MF or AML or show a reduced rate of clotting and bleeding events, we believe bomedemstat could eventually supplant hydroxyurea as the standard of care for front-line clinical use, if approved for this use.
 
Bomedemstat has received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for ET and Fast Track designation has been granted for ET in the U.S. There is no guarantee, however, that Fast Track designation for bomedemstat for the treatment of ET or other expedited development and review programs will result in a faster regulatory review or regulatory approval.
 
In the first half of 2021, we held preliminary discussions with the FDA about key trial design parameters for a registration-directed Phase 3 program of bomedemstat for the treatment of ET, and more specific details were discussed at a subsequent meeting with FDA in the second half of 2021. Based on these discussions, we believe a two-arm trial comparing bomedemstat to best available therapy to achieve the normalization of hematologic parameters, specifically, platelet and white blood cell counts, in the absence of leukoerythroblastosis, hemorrhagic and thrombotic events, or disease progression, may provide the basis for regulatory approval for

the second-line treatment of ET. With positive results from the pivotal clinical program, we would expect to submit applications for regulatory approval with the FDA and the EMA for ET.
 
Clinical Development of Bomedemstat for Myelofibrosis
 
We have completed enrollment in an international, single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat, as a monotherapy, for the treatment of advanced MF. To enroll in the Phase 2 MF trial, patients have had to have been resistant to an available approved therapy and have a platelet count of greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L. The primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints of this trial include safety and tolerability, and reduction in symptoms, as measured by the validated patient-reported outcome instrument MPN10, a questionnaire covering 10 characteristic MPN symptoms, and reduction in spleen volume as measured by imaging.
 
Of the 89 unique patients enrolled as of a cut-off date of October 31 (Note: 90 patients are included in safety analysis although only 89 unique patients were treated as one patient was taken off-study due to logistical challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequently re-enrolled with a different patient number.) 53% were deemed high-risk patients based upon IPSS, a standard prognostic evaluation. We have conducted deep serial DNA sequencing and mutational analysis of blood cells in these patients demonstrating that 63% have two or more mutations associated with MF, and 38% have mutations in genes, such as ASXL1, that put patients at high risk of transforming to AML.
 
Based upon the MPN10, as of the data cut-off date, 26% of patients who had clinically meaningful symptoms at baseline (TSS ≥20) experienced a symptom reduction of ≥50% at week 24 (N=23).

Of the 40 patients evaluable at 24 weeks for SVR as of the cut-off date, 30 patients (75%) had a reduction in spleen volume from baseline. Of the 36 evaluable patients who were transfusion-independent at baseline and treated for 12 weeks or longer, 32 patients (89%) had a stable or increased hemoglobin. The interim and unaudited data as of the cut-off date for symptom scores and spleen volumes from baseline to 24 weeks are shown in the following graphs.

As of the cut-off date, 1,443 adverse events, or AEs, were reported in 85 patients (94%) of which 82 were SAEs. Fourteen SAEs, one Grade 4, nine Grade 3 and four Grade 2 were deemed by investigators as possibly, probably or definitely related to bomedemstat: abdominal discomfort, splenomegaly, rectal haemorrhage, cardiac failure, headache, vertigo, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, anaemia, nausea (n=2), abdominal wall haemorrhage, sepsis, thrombocytopenia and pyoderma gangrenosum. As of the cut-off date, there have been no dose limiting toxicities, or deaths related to drug.
 
In our MF Phase 2 clinical trial, we have analyzed the occurrence of mutations and their changes over time for 261 genes that are recurrently mutated in blood cancers. This allows us to identify at baseline which mutations are associated with a given patient’s disease as well as additional mutations associated with myeloid malignancies, some of which place the patient at high risk for developing AML, a disease associated with the progressive accumulation of mutations in blood stem cells. These 261 genes are then re-sequenced during the course of treatment to assay the effect of bomedemstat may have on the frequency of each mutation as well as to identify any new mutations not detected at baseline. As of the cut-off date of October 31, 2021, we have serially analyzed the mutant allele frequencies, or MAF, and have not observed any new mutations nor transformation to AML during treatment periods, some lasting for more than 600 days. Of the 127 mutant alleles identified, 36% of the alleles showed a reduction in MAF and 45% of allele frequencies remained stable (change up or down defined as ≥5% for heterozygotes, ≥10% for increase/ ≥2.5% decrease for homozygous clones). There were 4 complete molecular responses (MAF reduced to 0). These interim and unaudited data are shown in the figure below.

Clones with CALR, MPL or JAK2 mutations all showed sensitivity to bomedemstat; clones with mutations in ASXL1, the most affected of the high molecular risk alleles (89% stable or decreased allele frequency), were also sensitive to bomedemstat. In patients with MF, the occurrence of mutations such as those in ASXL1 have been associated with poorer prognosis.
 


Changes in mutant allele frequency over time (interim and unaudited data)
 
For those evaluable patients (N=24) with excess blasts in the periphery, a sign of bone marrow stress that precedes the development of leukemia, 17 patients (71%) improved or resolved during therapy (analysis performed with May 17, 2021 data cut-off).
 
Patients from this study are now actively transitioning into a Phase 2 Extension Study initiated in 2021 enabling the collection of long-term safety and pharmacodynamic data.
 
Bomedemstat has received Orphan and Fast Track designation for MF from the FDA in addition to Orphan and PRIME designation from the EMA. However, there is no guarantee that Fast Track designation for bomedemstat for the treatment of MF or other expedited development and review programs will result in a faster regulatory review or regulatory approval.
 
Bomedemstat in Combination with Ruxolitinib for Myelofibrosis
 
Based on our preclinical data for bomedemstat plus ruxolitinib in a mouse model of MF, we believe the combination of bomedemstat and ruxolitinib represents an opportunity to improve the management of many patients with MF.
 The graphs below show the effects of bomedemstat and ruxolitinib both individually and in combination on platelet counts and spleen weights in this mouse model of MF.

Effect of bomedemstat and ruxolitinib, individually and in combination, on spleen weight in a mouse model of MF
 
We intend to support a two-arm investigator-sponsored clinical trial of this combination. The first arm will evaluate the addition of bomedemstat to a stable dose of ruxolitinib for patients with MF who have had a sub-optimal response. The second arm will evaluate the combination of the two drugs in patients with MF who have not previously received treatment for MF. We expect this clinical trial to open in 2022 and to treat up to 10 patients in each arm of the trial.
 
Based upon the results from our ongoing monotherapy and contemplated combination clinical trials, we intend to have discussions with the FDA about the endpoints and control arm for a registrational Phase 3 program in MF. Following these discussions, we may choose to initiate such a program. With positive results from the pivotal clinical program, we would expect to submit an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA seeking regulatory approval for MF.
 



Additional Programs Targeting LSD1
 
We intend to continue to evaluate commercially meaningful opportunities for bomedemstat. For instance, we believe bomedemstat may be a viable treatment for PV, an MPN characterized by the excessive production of red blood cells. The prevalence in the United States is approximately 100,000 patients and there is currently no curative treatment. Low-risk patients are typically managed initially with phlebotomy and higher-risk patients are typically prescribed a cytotoxic therapy, like hydroxyurea. Because LSD1 inhibition modulates the proliferation of malignant blood cells, we believe bomedemstat may represent a novel therapeutic option for this patient population. An ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial is evaluating bomedemstat in up to approximately 10 patients with PV who have failed at least one standard therapy.
 
We believe bomedemstat may have potential in the treatment of a wide variety of other bone marrow cancers, either as a single agent or in combination with other drugs, given the role LSD1 plays in the production of blood cells in the bone marrow. Based on our preclinical studies, we also believe bomedemstat may enhance the clinical effects of checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, in a combination treatment of solid tumors, e.g., small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, or prostate cancer.
 
The LSD1 protein acts as both an enzyme as well as a scaffold to which other proteins associate such as DNA methytransferase-1, or DNMT1 and histone deacetylases, or HDACs. The LSD1-containing complex of proteins is bound to specific sites in the genome through the agency of various transcription factors such as growth factor independent 1b, or GFI1b. Bomedemstat is designed to inhibit the enzymatic activity of LSD1, i.e., the catalytic removal of methyl groups from histone 3 lysine 4. Bomedemstat also prevents the binding of LSD1 to GFI1b, the mechanism by which megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production is controlled. We are currently engaged in lead discovery of a series of small molecules designed to target LSD1 to solely inhibit the enzymatic activity of LSD1 or its ability to bind transcription factors such as GFI1b. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe these novel LSD1 inhibitors will have distinct biological effects from bomedemstat and, hence, have clinical applications distinct from bomedemstat, specifically, other bone marrow disorders.

Academic studies have demonstrated that inhibition of LSD1 can induce the production of fetal hemoglobin which normally shuts off shortly after birth. Fetal hemoglobin can compensate for defects in adult hemoglobin that contribute to the development of sickle cell disease and thalassemia. The goal of this program is to develop novel inhibitors of LSD1 to provide levels of fetal hemoglobin which, based on published academic research, may reduce or eliminate the symptoms, morbidity and mortality from these hemoglobinopathies. We are currently conducting lead optimization and preclinical studies, and the next milestone for this program would be to nominate a clinical candidate.
 
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry in general, and oncology clinical development in particular, is characterized by rapidly advancing and changing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial and increasing competition from many different sources, including large and specialty biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Competitors may compete with us by hiring scientific and management personnel, recruiting key scientific and clinical advisors, establishing clinical study sites, recruiting patients to participate in clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
For the treatment of MF, Incyte markets ruxolitinib in the United States, and Novartis markets the drug in the rest of the world. Bristol-Myers Squibb markets the JAK inhibitor fedratinib in the United States. The FDA has granted accelerated approval for pacritinib from CTI BioPharma in the United States. A number of companies are developing other product candidates for myeloproliferative neoplasms, some with unique mechanisms of action. Among such companies are AbbVie, Acceleron, Fibrogen, Geron, Kartos, Protagonist, MorphoSys, Roche, 4SC, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Epizyme, GlaxoSmithKline, Incyte, Merck, Oryzon, Salarius, Spectrum, Taiho, Takeda, Vivid and Sierra Oncology.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We obtain bomedemstat for our clinical trials using third-party contract manufacturing organizations to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient and others to manufacture the capsules taken by patients. We expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
 
Bomedemstat is a small molecule that is manufactured in controlled, reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require special equipment.
 
Intellectual Property
 

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. For our patent portfolio for pipeline drug candidates, we seek to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use and manufacture. Our policy is to pursue, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary know-how that may be important to the development of our business.
 
As of March 1, 2022, for bomedemstat, we owned seven patent families, which collectively are directed to composition-of-matter coverage of bomedemstat, its formulations, its synthesis, and its methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain LSD1-mediated diseases or disorders including cancers.
 
The first patent family covering the composition-of-matter of bomedemstat or methods of its use includes three issued U.S. patent and over 15 granted foreign patents, including granted patents in Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Patent applications are pending in Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa, and the United States. The issued U.S. patents in the first patent family are projected to expire, inclusive of patent term adjustment, in 2034, not including any patent term extensions that may be available. Corresponding foreign patents are generally projected to expire in 2034, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    The second patent family covering the composition-of-matter of bomedemstat or methods of its use includes three issued U.S. patent and four granted foreign patents in Australia, China, Israel, and Japan. Patent applications are pending in Brazil, Canada, Europe, India, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States. The issued U.S. patents in the second patent family are projected to expire, inclusive of patent term adjustment, in 2036, not including any patent term extensions that may be available. Corresponding foreign patents are generally projected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
   The third patent family covering methods of treating myeloproliferative neoplasms with bomedemstat includes one pending U.S. application. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    The fourth patent family covering a stereospecific ketoreductase synthesis of an intermediate used to make bomedemstat includes one pending U.S. application and one pending application in each of China and Hong Kong. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    The fifth patent family covering a process for preparing bomedemstat includes one pending U.S. application and one pending application in China. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    The sixth patent family covering a method of treating myeloproliferative neoplasm with bomedemstat includes a pending U.S. application and a pending application under Patent Cooperation Treaty. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2040, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    The seventh patent family covering a formulation of bomedemstat includes a pending application under Patent Cooperation Treaty. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2041, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    As of March 1, 2022, we also owned a patent family drawn to irreversible LSD1 inhibitors, including a pending U.S. patent application and pending patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. The patent family is directed to composition-of-matter coverage of the inhibitors, formulations, and methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain LSD1-mediated diseases or disorders including cancers. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    As of March 1, 2022, we also owned a patent family drawn to reversible LSD1 inhibitors including a pending U.S. provisional application. Any patents that may issue from this family are generally projected to expire in 2042, not including any patent term extensions that may be available.
    Our commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future drug candidates as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our drugs depends in large part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our own pending patent

applications or with respect to any patent applications filed or licensed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to, or licensed by, us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our drug candidates, discovery programs and processes. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our owned patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
    The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, in certain cases, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term extension as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits such patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended and the amount of available extension to any extension-eligible patent which claims a product, a method of using a product or a method of manufacturing a product, depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates related to the regulatory review period. Provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drugs receive FDA or analogous foreign approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those drugs from the applicable authorities where patent term extension is available, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
    In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information of our business that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.
    Moreover, third parties may still obtain this proprietary information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets and know how the value of this information may be greatly reduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.
    The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent or other intellectual property or other proprietary right would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or any of our drug candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

    Government Regulation
 
Among others, the FDA, the EMA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation

in the European Union, or EU, are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
 
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
 ▪submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 ▪approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
 ▪submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal trials;
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs;
 ▪potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
 ▪FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
▪Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence 


on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 ▪Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 ▪Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the approved indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points are generally prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor to obtain the FDA’s feedback on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Process
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product application also includes a non-orphan indication.
 

The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of 10 months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may contain limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient

quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to 10 months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
 
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register

their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third- party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third- party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 ▪fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 ▪clinical holds on clinical studies;
 ▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 ▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 ▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 ▪the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 ▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the

exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well- controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services.
 
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost- containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product.
 
Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. Additionally, the ACA:
 
▪increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price;
 ▪required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
 ▪required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
 ▪imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
 

Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and will remain open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law or our business.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders issued by the former Trump administration designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The likelihood of success of these and other measures initiated by the former Trump administration is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 27 employees, including a total of nine employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 20 employees are engaged in research and development and seven are engaged in business development, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, information technology and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
