Item 1. BUSINESS.
Blockchain Generally

Distributed blockchain technology is a decentralized and encrypted ledger that is designed to offer a secure, efficient, verifiable, and permanent way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. Blockchain technologies are being evaluated for a multitude of industries due to the belief in their ability to have a significant impact in many areas of business, finance, information management, and governance.
Company Overview

We are an early stage technology company focused on developing blockchain software platforms. Our plan is to license intellectual property and plan to build blockchain platforms for a variety of uses. Our initial efforts will focus on utilizing the intellectual property in two ways: to develop secure blockchain based supply chain and inventory control systems, and to develop a blockchain based trading platform in order to facilitate securities trading using either a fiat currency or cryptocurrency.

We plan to develop blockchain based supply chain and inventory control systems that will provide value to businesses across industries by optimizing inventory levels and production targets. For example, distribution companies will be able to utilize the blockchain software platform to control and organize their production and distribution networks. Further, hospital systems will be able to optimize patient care and product supply chains. Our goal in developing a blockchain based trading platform is to make securities trading easier, faster, and safer.

Competition

We expect the Company to compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on developing programming for the blockchain. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include “bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured. Several public companies (traded in the U.S. and Internationally), such as the following, may be considered to compete with us, although we believe there is no company, including the following, which engages in the same scope of activities as we do.

● | Blockchain Industries, Inc. (formerly Omni Global Technologies, Inc.)
● | DMG Blockchain Solutions 
● | Riot Blockchain, Inc. 


There is limited available information regarding our potential non-public competitors. The blockchain industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry and new competitors and/or emerging technologies could enter the market and affect our competitiveness in the future.

Government Regulation 

We may be subject to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations, some of which may apply to us as a result of our blockchain business.

Government regulation of blockchain is being actively considered by the United States federal government via several agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as similar entities in other countries. State government regulation also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Regulations may substantially change in the future and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to our business, or when they will be effective. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws which may affect our activities.

Intellectual Property

As of April 30, 2020, we did not have any intellectual property. See, Recent Developments.

Employees

As of April 30, 2020, we had no employees. Our officers provided services to us on a contract basis as needed.

Corporate Information

We were incorporated in the State of Florida on April 8, 2013, with a fiscal year end of April 30th. Until June 2017, we had not established any business operations and had not achieved any revenues. Until then, we were in the process of identifying and evaluation feasible business opportunities in the consumer products and technologies industries. On December 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to “Black Cactus Global, Inc.”

A company continues to be deemed an “emerging growth company” until the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Our first sale of common equity pursuant to an effective registration statement was during the three months ended October 31, 2013, and last day of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities was April 30, 2019. As a result, after April 30, 2019, we were no longer an “emerging growth company”.

Recent Developments

As of June 29, 2020, the Company and Charteris, Mackie, Baillie and Cummins Limited (“CMBC”) entered into a waiver and agreement (the “Waiver Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company and CMBC agreed to close the following two pending licensing arrangements: (1) a non-exclusive license for a blockchain development software platform and related intellectual property pursuant to a Software License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), dated August 24, 2019, between the Company and CMBC, and (2) an assignment of a non-exclusive software license for certain software and intellectual property licensed by CMBC to Benchmark Advisors Limited (“Benchmark”) pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, dated November 15, 2019, between the Company, and CMBC and Benchmark (the “Benchmark Assignment” and together with the License Agreement, the “CMBC License Agreements”).

The closings of the license and assignment pursuant to the CMBC License Agreements were subject to a number of conditions, most of which had not been satisfied on or before the date of the closings. Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, CMBC, among other things, waived all of the conditions that had not been satisfied in order to consummate the closings of the license and assignment pursuant to the CMBC License Agreements.

 As of June 29, 2020, as consideration for the licenses provided under License Agreement and in satisfaction of its payment obligations under the License Agreement, the Company authorized the issuance of 249,109,944 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) to Black Cactus Holdings LLC, the designee of CMBC, to be issued in two certificates each in the name of “Black Cactus Holdings LLC”, as follows: (i) one certificate representing 174,109,944 shares of Common Stock, which was issued and delivered to Black Cactus Holdings LLC, and (ii) one certificate representing 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock, which was supposed to be issued to Black Cactus Holdings LLC, but was reduced to 60,100,500 shares of Common Stock because the Company does not currently have enough authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock to issue all of such shares. The Company intends to issue the remaining shares of Common Stock to Black Cactus Holdings LLC as soon as they become available. The certificate for 60,100,500 shares is being held in escrow by the Company, and the certificate for the additional shares of Common Stock will also be held in escrow by the Company, until such time as certain shares of Common Stock have been cancelled on the certified shareholder records of the Company or as otherwise provided in the Waiver Agreement.

Effective as of June 29, 2020, Jeremy Towning notified the Company that he was resigning from his position as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, but continues as the Chief Financial Officer and a director of the Company. 

In connection with the closing of the License Agreement, effective as of June 29, 2020, the Board, pursuant to its powers under the Company’s bylaws, appointed Karyn Augustinus and Lawrence P. Cummins as members of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), Lawrence P. Cummins as Chief Executive Officer, and Lawrence C. Cummins as Vice President.
