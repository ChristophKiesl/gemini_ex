ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Giga-tronics Incorporated manufactures specialized electronics equipment for use in both military test and airborne operational applications. Our operations consist of two business segments, those of our wholly owned subsidiary, Microsource, Inc. (“Microsource”) and those of our Giga-tronics Division. Our Microsource segment designs and manufactures custom microwave products for military airborne, sea, and ground applications while the Giga-tronics Division designs and manufactures high fidelity signal simulation and recording solutions for RADAR and Electronic Warfare (“EW”) (“RADAR/EW”) test applications.
 
Giga-tronics was incorporated on March 5, 1980. We acquired Microsource on May 18, 1998.
 
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 5990 Gleason Drive, Dublin, California 94568, and our telephone number at that location is (925) 328-4650. Our website address is https://www.gigatronics.com.
 
Reverse Split
 
On December 12, 2019, we completed a one-for-fifteen reverse stock split of our common stock. All shares and per share amounts included in this report, including the financial statements, have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split unless otherwise indicated.
Reporting Segments
 
Our business has two reporting segments: Microsource and the Giga-tronics Division.
 
Microsource
 
Microsource primarily develops custom microwave products for use in military airborne, sea and ground applications. Microsource’s two largest customers are prime contractors for which we develop and manufacture sophisticated RADAR filters used in fighter aircraft. Revenues from Microsource comprised a majority of our revenues for the fiscal years ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020.

Giga-tronics Division
 
Our Giga-tronics Division designs, manufactures, and markets a family of functional test products and integrates those test products along with third-party hardware and software to create full test solutions for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market. Our RADAR/EW test solutions are used to evaluate and improve the performance of RADAR/EW systems. Giga-tronics Division customers include major United States (“U.S.”) defense prime contractors, the U.S. armed services and research institutes.
Products and Markets
 
Microsource
 
Microsource’s primary business is the production of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (“YIG”) based microwave components designed specifically for the intended operational application. Microsource produces a line of tunable, synthesized Band Reject Filters for solving interference problems in RADAR/EW applications as well as low noise oscillators used on shipboard and land-based self-protection systems. Microsource designs components based upon the Company’s proprietary YIG technology, for each customer’s unique requirement, generally at the customer’s expense.
 
While our YIG technology may be used in a variety of operational applications and as components in microwave instruments and devices, Microsource’s two largest customers are prime contractors for whom we develop, and manufacture RADAR filters used in fighter aircrafts. Microsource serves the market for operational hardware associated with the U.S. Government’s RADAR Modernization Program for prior generation fighter aircrafts (i.e., the F-15D, F-16, and F/A-18E jets) to extend their useful lives. These RADAR filters are designed to withstand the rigors of operating under extreme conditions. Microsource also delivers YIG hardware for shipboard and land-based Close-In-Weapon-Systems (“CIWS”) used to defend against missile attacks.
 
Our customers require that Microsource be certified to the stringent AS9100D aerospace quality standard. Microsource routinely maintains a top-quality rating as measured quarterly by its customers, and over the years has received multiple “Gold Supplier” awards, as well as a “Supplier of the Year” award from one of our prime customers.
 
Microsource handles sensitive information and must maintain a certified Cyber-Security program to protect against network intrusion and theft of customer data, as well as loss of its own proprietary information. Our IT infrastructure team is working toward a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification Level 3. In addition, test equipment and systems used in the manufacture of our microwave components must be audited periodically by the Department of Defense for continued authorization to operate.
 
Microsource’s revenues have grown over time as prime contractors began upgrading additional aircraft variants. Initially Microsource supplied filters for one fighter jet, the F/A-18E. During our 2014 fiscal year, the prime contractor added a second aircraft, the F-15D and during our 2017 fiscal year, a second prime contractor added a third aircraft, the F-16. As a result, Microsource’s revenue was $9.4 million for our fiscal year ended March 27, 2021 as we delivered filters for approximately 170 aircrafts. We believe there are over 3,000 potential domestic and foreign F-15D, F-16 and F/A-18E aircrafts that have not been upgraded. Microsource is a sole-source supplier of filters for these three fighter jets, and we expect that the business will continue to be a significant source of our future revenue.
 
Revenue associated with Microsource’s CIWS components may increase in future years as foreign demand for U.S. missile defense systems grows.
 
Giga-tronics Division
 
Our Giga-tronics Division designs, manufactures, and markets a family of functional test systems for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market. Our RADAR/EW test systems are used to evaluate and improve the performance of RADAR systems and EW counter measures, such as jammers. Giga-tronics Division customers include major U.S. defense prime contractors, the armed services (primarily in the United States) and research institutes.
 
Our goal is to become a leading supplier of test solutions for evaluating defense RADAR/EW systems. The same digital technology that has revolutionized commercial communications, consumer and automotive electronics is now being applied to advanced RADAR/EW systems. This shift in technology limits the effectiveness of traditional test solutions that are unable to actively interact with the RADAR/EW systems being tested. In contrast to traditional test systems, we specifically architected the Giga-tronics testing platform like a RADAR system to offer sophisticated control and real-time behavior that supports active interaction with the devices being tested. To our knowledge, no other RADAR/EW test system offers real time responses and closed loop behavior in the same manner as our technology.

The Test Challenge
 
The Giga-tronics RADAR/EW test system enables users to test RADAR/EW systems by simulating multiple, dynamic RADAR/EW signals that a fighter jet experiences in combat situations.
 
Traditional open loop test systems operate by sending a pre-recorded set of signals to the RADAR/EW system being tested. Thus, these traditional systems are unable to interact with the new adaptive RADAR/EW systems. Therefore, we believe that prime contractors and government test facilities are seeking new test solutions that deliver a closer correlation between laboratory testing and field testing by better simulating the changing and reacting signals that exist in combat situations.
Giga-tronics’ Solution 
 
We designed our Giga-tronics RADAR/EW test system to address this challenge. Our RADAR/EW test system employs a RADAR-like architecture, allowing it to accurately simulate RADAR/EW signals for testing. In addition, our RADAR/EW test system is architected to interact with the system under test by modifying its signals in response to signals generated by the system under test, creating a “closed-loop” testing environment that simulates the behavior of RADAR/EW systems in combat situations. We believe that our Giga-tronics RADAR/EW test system is the first commercial RADAR/EW test system architected to offer this closed-loop behavior, which interacts with the system being tested. This closed-loop design also permits our RADAR/EW test system to digitally record the signals generated during testing for later analysis.
 
We believe our RADAR/EW test solution offers several competitive advantages:
 

1. | It is specifically designed for generating realistic RADAR signals for testing purposes.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | It is architected to offer real-time, dynamic, closed-loop behavior that can interact with the devices under test for fully evaluating and improving RADAR/EW performance.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | It features digital processing hardware and firmware, creating a test solution that may be customized with relative ease compared to traditional test systems.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | It is scalable, allowing us to build test systems with multiple channels that scale well both in terms of size and costs compared to traditional systems.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Its size allows for portable operation.
---+----------------------------------------

 
We believe that government test facilities are potentially a significant source of revenue because our solutions are portable and can be mounted in trucks for use on military bases and in remote locations. Test engineers are using our equipment to generate realistic RADAR signals for air-crew training and in-flight evaluation of EW system effectiveness. We have delivered portable threat emulation solutions to both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force. This portable application represents a market expansion for our threat emulation solution and is expected to be a growth driver in fiscal year 2022.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
 
Substantially all the components required by Giga-tronics to make its assemblies are available from more than one source. We occasionally use sole source arrangements to obtain leading-edge technology or favorable pricing or supply terms, but not in any material volume. In our opinion, the loss of any sole source arrangement we have would not materially affect our operations. Some suppliers are also competitors of Giga-tronics. In the event a competitor-supplier chooses not to sell its products to us, production delays could occur as we seek new suppliers or re-design components of our products.
 
Although extended delays in receipt of components from our suppliers could result in longer product delivery schedules for us, we attempt to mitigate this risk by dealing with well-established suppliers and maintaining good relationships with such suppliers.

Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Our competitive position is largely dependent upon our ability to provide performance specifications for our instruments and systems that (a) effectively and reliably meet customers’ needs and (b) selectively surpass competitors’ specifications in competing products. While patents may provide protection of proprietary designs, with the rapid progress of technological development in our industry, such protection is often short-lived. Therefore, although we occasionally pursue patent coverage, we place major emphasis on the development of new products with superior performance specifications and the upgrading of existing products toward this same end.
 
Our products are primarily based on our own designs, which are derived from our own engineering abilities. If our new product engineering efforts fall behind, our competitive position weakens. Conversely, effective product development greatly enhances our competitive status.
 
We have maintained four non-provisional patents related to our legacy 2500B parametric signal generator product line, which was not among the legacy product lines that have been sold. These patents describe advanced synthesis techniques and can be extended for use with the Giga-tronics Advanced Signal Generator & Analyzer (“ASGA”) system and to a number of Microsource synthesizer components. In February of 2020, the Company was granted a non-provisional U.S. patent relating to its ASGA system. The patent describes the internal design of the Advanced Signal Generator (“ASG”) and Advanced Signal Analyzer (“ASA”) along with the architecture of how all the components work together to facilitate building multi-channel test systems with reduced size, weight and cost as compared to present solutions. A second non-provisional patent was granted in November of 2020 describing uses of the ASGA system in high channel-count situations. A third non-provisional patent application which was filed in April of 2020 describing how the ASGA achieves its low noise performance is currently pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
We are not substantially dependent on trademarks, licenses, or franchises. While we utilize certain software licenses in certain functional aspects for some of our products, such licenses are generally readily available, non-exclusive and are obtained at either no cost or for a relatively small fee.
 
Working Capital Practices
 
We generally strive to maintain adequate levels of inventory and we generally sell to customers on 30-day payment terms in the U.S. and generally allow more time for our international customers. Typically, we receive payment terms of 30 days from our suppliers. We believe that these practices are consistent with typical industry practices.
 
Dependence on a Limited Number of Customers
 
We are a supplier of RADAR filters for fighter jet aircrafts and RADAR/EW testing solutions to various U.S. government defense agencies, as well as to their prime contractors. We anticipate that revenue from U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors will remain the source of substantially all of our revenue in fiscal 2022. U.S. and international defense-related agencies accounted for 100% of net revenue in fiscal 2021 and 99% of net revenue in fiscal 2020. Commercial business accounted for 0% and 1% of net revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
At the Giga-tronics Division, U.S. defense agencies and their prime contractors accounted for over 99% and commercial business accounted for less than 1% of net revenue in fiscal 2021 and 95% and 5% of net revenue in fiscal 2020, respectively. Microsource reported 100% of net revenue to prime contractors of U.S. defense agencies in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.
 
During fiscal 2021, two prime contractors in the Microsource segment accounted for 66% of our consolidated revenues. A third customer accounted for 14% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2021 and was included in the Giga-tronics Division reporting segment.
 
During fiscal 2020, two prime contractors in the Microsource segment accounted for 64% of our consolidated revenues. A third customer accounted for 18% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2020 and was included in the Giga-tronics Division reporting segment.
 
We could experience a material adverse effect on our financial stability if there was a significant loss of one of our U.S. defense customers.

Both Microsource and our Giga-tronics Division products are largely dependent on U.S. defense spending and budgets and are subject to expansion and contraction between fiscal year periods. Revenues from Microsource products and services often span several years with deliveries varying between both interim and annual fiscal year periods. Additionally, the Giga-tronics Division’s RADAR/EW testing system is a relatively new product platform with fewer targeted customers and significantly longer sales cycles and greater average selling prices when compared to our prior general-purpose test and measurement equipment product lines. We therefore expect that a major customer in one year may not be a major customer in the following year. Accordingly, our net revenue and earnings may vary significantly from one period to the next and will decline if we are unable to find new customers or cannot increase our business with other existing customers to replace declining net revenue from the previous year’s major customers.
 
Backlog of Orders
 
On March 27, 2021, our backlog of unfilled orders was approximately $5.1 million compared to approximately $6.8 million at March 28, 2020. Orders for our products include program orders from prime contractors with extended delivery dates. Accordingly, the backlog of orders may vary substantially from year to year and the backlog entering any single fiscal quarter may not be indicative of revenue for any period. In addition, effective April 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue for certain contracts as it incurs costs, as opposed to when units are delivered and, as a result, our backlog is reduced when revenue is recognized for those orders.
 
Backlog includes only those customer orders for which a binding agreement exists, a delivery schedule has been agreed upon between us and our customer and, in the case of U.S. government orders, for which funding has been appropriated.
 
Competition
 
The Company primarily competes in two different markets: Microsource’s YIG components and Giga-tronics RADAR/EW test systems.
 
Microsource is a sole source supplier serving the market for filter components associated with the U.S. Government’s RADAR Modernization Program for certain prior generation fighter jet aircrafts (F-15D, F-16 and F/A-18E jets) and for oscillators in shipboard and land-based missile defense systems. Our Microsource segment supplies RADAR filters specifically designed for military aircraft to solve an interference problem created when newer, more powerful RADARs are installed on older aircrafts and also provides oscillators for RADARs used to track incoming missiles. Only a few other companies possess the technical know-how to design and manufacture YIG components of this nature, such as Teledyne and Micro-Lambda Wireless, but we believe the expense of developing and requalifying new components is prohibitive to the point where an existing prime customer would only undertake such an effort if major issues were to arise, such as significant technical deficiencies or our inability to deliver products on time.
 
Microsource has regularly received a gold-supplier rating from its customers and we believe our sole source position is secure.
 
The Giga-tronics Division serves the defense electronics market with a microwave test platform used in the evaluation of military RADAR/EW systems. This application represents a niche segment within the broader test equipment market. While this niche market segment of RADAR/EW testing is large enough to be meaningful to Giga-tronics, we believe it is too small to attract larger competitors, such as Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments who, to our knowledge, do not approach these markets with new dedicated solutions.
 
We have developed a unique architecture to address the RADAR/EW test requirements that are adaptive/cognitive. We believe that testing these new RADAR and jamming (i.e. interference) signals is best solved by a real time, closed loop, dynamic simulation system. We believe our Giga-tronics RADAR/EW architecture presents a paradigm shift providing for a closed loop test capability that to our knowledge is currently unavailable elsewhere. Our competitors often have greater resources in research, development and manufacturing and substantially broader product lines and channels. To compete, we place strong emphasis on maintaining a high degree of technical competence as it relates to the development of new microwave products, are highly selective in establishing technological objectives and focus sales and marketing activities in the selected niche areas that are weakly served or underserved by our competitors. Competitors that make alternative equipment to the Giga-tronics ASGA system include ELCOM (a division of Frequency Electronics Inc.), VIAVI, and EWST (a division of Ultra Electronics Plc). Two larger companies, Northrop Grumman/Amherst and Textron/AAI sell open loop test equipment that competes with the Giga-tronics solutions, though their solutions are much larger in size and have a much higher selling price. We do not believe that either of these suppliers are likely to offer an adaptive closed loop testing system or a solution that can be used on portable platforms on open air ranges, such as our solution.

Sales and Marketing
 
Microsource and the Giga-tronics Division sell their products primarily direct to U.S. defense agencies and their prime defense contractors. The Company primarily relies on its internal sales teams to identify leads and complete sales. It also engages independent sales representatives who are perceived to have expertise with targeted markets and/or customers.
Product Development
 
Products manufactured by Giga-tronics historically have had relatively long product life cycles. However, the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological changes at the component level. Our future success is dependent on our ability to steadily incorporate new functionality and advancements in component technologies into our new products. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, product development expenses totaled approximately $2.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.
 
Our product development activities have historically been funded internally, through product line sales, or through outside equity investment and debt financing. Product development activities are expensed as incurred.
 
We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development, the majority of which is focused within the Giga-tronics Division, though we expect some continuing investment in Microsource in order to develop concepts that lead to future customer funded projects and ultimately quantity production. There can be no assurance that future technologies, processes or product developments will not render our current product offerings obsolete or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products that satisfy customer needs in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company assembles and tests Microsource and Giga-tronics Division products at its Dublin, California headquarters facility. Microsource develops and manufactures RADAR filters used in fighter jet aircrafts and low noise oscillators used in CIWS. Our Giga-tronics Division manufactures a family of functional test products and integrates those test products along with third-party hardware and software to create full test solutions for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market.
Environment
 
To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations involving the protection of the environment.
 
Employees
 
As of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, we employed 42 individuals on a full-time basis. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in our markets is competitive. While our size and capital resources constrain our ability to attract and retain employees with cash compensation, we attempt to compensate for this constraint by offering equity awards and opportunities for training and internal promotion. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Information about Foreign Operations
 
We have limited revenues internationally. We sell to our international customers through a network of foreign technical sales representative organizations. All transactions with our international customers are in U.S. dollars.
