ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on May 27, 2020 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination, we initially concentrated on target businesses making a positive contribution to sustainability through the ownership, financing and management of societal infrastructure.
Formation
 
On May 27, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs in consideration of 8,625,000 founder shares. The founder shares included an aggregate of up 1,125,000 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so that our sponsor would own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering (assuming our sponsor did not purchase any public shares in our IPO). On August 27, 2020, as a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option and the forfeiture of the remaining over-allotment option, 638,664 founder shares were forfeited and 486,336 founder shares ceased to be subject to forfeiture, resulting in an aggregate of 7,986,336 founder shares issued and outstanding.
Initial Public Offering
 
On August 20, 2020, we consummated our IPO of 30,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $300,000,000, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each warrant will become exercisable for one share of common stock, with an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of our IPO or 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, NGA consummated the sale of 7,750,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our sponsor generating gross proceeds of $7,750,000. On August 27, 2020, in connection with the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option in our IPO, NGA sold an additional 1,945,344 units at $10.00 per unit and sold an additional 389,069 private placement warrants to our sponsor, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $19,842,509.
 
The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants sold in our IPO, except that the private placement warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. Our sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the private placement warrants and underlying shares of common stock (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
On November 30, 2020, we entered into a business combination agreement and plan of reorganization (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with The Lion Electric Company, a corporation existing under the Business Corporations Act (Québec) (“Lion Electric”), and Lion Electric Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Lion Electric (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger,” together with the other transactions related thereto, the “Proposed Lion Transaction”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lion Electric (the “Surviving Corporation”).
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Proposed Lion Transaction by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the Company’s certificate of incorporation.

In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and Lion Electric entered into separate subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with a number of investors (the “Subscribers”), pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and Lion Electric agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 20,040,200 Lion Electric Common Shares (the “PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $200,402,000, in a private placement (the “PIPE”). The closing of the sale of the PIPE Shares pursuant to the Subscription Agreements is contingent upon, among other customary closing conditions, the concurrent consummation of the Proposed Lion Transaction. The purpose of the PIPE is to raise additional capital for use by Lion Electric following the closing.
 
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, Lion Electric, and our sponsor entered into the Stockholder Support and Lock-Up Agreement (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”) pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to vote all of its shares of common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the Proposed Lion Transaction. Additionally, our sponsor agreed, among other things, not to (a) transfer any of its shares of common stock or warrants, or any Lion Electric common shares or warrants acquired in exchange therefor pursuant to the Proposed Lion Transaction, for certain periods of time as set forth in the Stockholder Support Agreement, subject to certain customary exceptions or (b) enter into any voting arrangement that is inconsistent with the commitment under the Stockholder Support Agreement to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Proposed Lion Transaction.
 
The Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 30, 2020.
 
On December 31, 2020, Lion Electric filed a registration statement on Form F-4 (File No: 333-251847) (as amended, the “Lion Registration Statement”) relating to the Business Combination. Once the SEC declares the Registration Statement effective, we will mail the definitive proxy statement/prospectus statement relating to the special meeting of our stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. The Business Combination is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to approval by our stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Proposed Lion Transaction.
 
NYSE Listing
 
The public shares, units, and public warrants are currently listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbols “NGA,” “NGA.U,” and “NGA.WS,” respectively. Upon the closing of the Proposed Lion Transaction described above, our securities will be delisted from the NYSE and it is expected that Lion Electric’s common shares will be listed on the NYSE.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination, like the Proposed Lion Transaction, with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operating and deal expertise. Our selection process leverages our management team’s network of relationships, deal sourcing capability and unique industry experiences to access a wide range of proprietary opportunities. The team members have developed these capabilities during their respective career endeavors which have included, for Mr. Michael Hoffman, pursuing a distinguished career in originating and completing successful renewable energy investments for recognized private equity firms and for Mr. Ian Robertson, building Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. into a broad-based power and utility infrastructure company recognized as one of the most sustainable companies globally. Our management team has a history of sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses. They also share deep relationships with target companies and capital markets advisors, as well as extensive experience raising both debt and equity capital across business cycles. These experiences have provided them with a broad understanding of public market performance and investor expectations, enhancing their ability to provide mentorship as a target management team transitions from private to public markets.

Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. However, we will not be required to meet this condition if we are not then listed on the NYSE.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post- transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we anticipate only completing such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, such as Lion Electric, we conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers or directors. While Lion Electric is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Proposed Lion Transaction and seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
3

 

Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
 Our officers had agreed not to become an officer or director of any other special purpose acquisition company which has publicly filed a registration statement with the SEC until we entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our IPO. Subsequent to entering into the Business Combination Agreement with Lion Electric, our officers and directors formed Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II (“Northern Genesis II”), a special purpose allocation, which completed its initial public offering on January 15, 2021, and Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. III (“Northern Genesis III”), which has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for its initial public offering.

Acquisition Criteria
 
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, such as Lion Electric, for a business combination:

● | Ability to align with our sustainability principles and support reduction of carbon intensity 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Defined barriers to entry or sustainable competitive advantages 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Predictable revenue and free cash flow to support reinvestment growth 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Little material technology, scale-up or market risk and success not premised on future capital raises to achieve growth plans 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity to benefit from our management team’s network and expertise to drive improved financial performance 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to benefit from access to the public capital markets 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, we may elect to pursue a business combination with a target business that may not meet any of the foregoing criteria and guidelines. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
4

 

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Public Offering, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination of approximately $308,000,000 (after payment of $11,180,870 of deferred underwriting fees, but before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
 We have until August 20, 2022 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete a business combination within such period (and our stockholders have not approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to extend this time period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem our public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of our then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination by August 20, 2022.

Our sponsor and our officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by August 20, 2022. However, if they acquire our public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period.
 
Our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with an initial business combination or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 20, 2022 or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations), divided by the number of our then outstanding public shares. However, we cannot redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of a business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
If our funds held outside of the trust account are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing a plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay our tax obligations, we may request the trustee to release to it an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by our public stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by our public stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against the company to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intends to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to claims based on fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of such a waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to the company than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.

Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive agreement for a business combination, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.00 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account (even if such waiver is deemed to be unenforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy this indemnity obligation nor have we asked our sponsor to reserve for such eventuality, and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of the company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for the initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete an initial business combination and our stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of our public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligation or that it has no indemnification obligation related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligation. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligation to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that claims of creditors will not reduce the actual value of the per-share redemption price to less than $10.00 per public share.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders of a corporation may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.
 
If we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, it is our intention to redeem the public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the procedures provided for by Section 280 of the DGCL. As such, our stockholders potentially could be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires that we adopt a plan upon dissolution, based on facts known to us at such time, that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors and the underwriters in our IPO), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited.
 
7

 

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. Therefore, in the event of a bankruptcy, we cannot assure you that we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by our stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 4801 Main Street, Suite 1000, Kansas City, MO 64112. The cost for our use of any office space used by us, including this space, is included in the $10,000 per month fee we will pay to our sponsor or its affiliates for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We do not have any full-time employees and we do not intend to have any prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
