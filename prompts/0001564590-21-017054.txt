Item 1. Business
General
 Iconix Brand Group is a brand management company and owner of a diversified portfolio of approximately 30 global consumer brands across the women’s, men’s, home and international segments. The Company’s business strategy is to maximize the value of its brands primarily through strategic licenses and joint venture partnerships around the world, as well as to grow the portfolio of brands through strategic acquisitions.
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s brand portfolio includes Candie’s ®, Bongo ®, Joe Boxer ®, Rampage ®, Mudd ®, London Fog ®, Mossimo ®, Ocean Pacific/OP ®, Danskin/Danskin Now ®, Rocawear ®, Cannon ®, Royal Velvet ®, Fieldcrest ®, Charisma ®, Starter ®, Waverly ®, Ecko Unltd ® /Mark Ecko Cut & Sew ®, Zoo York ®, Umbro ®, Lee Cooper ®, and Artful Dodger ®; and interests in Material Girl ®, Ed Hardy ®, Truth or Dare ®, Modern Amusement ®, Buffalo ®, Hydraulic ®, and PONY ®.
 The Company principally looks to monetize the Intellectual Property (“IP”) related to its brands throughout the world and in all relevant categories primarily by licensing directly with leading retailers (“direct to retail” or “DTR”), through consortia of wholesale licensees, through joint ventures in specific territories and via other activity such as corporate sponsorships and content as well as the sale of IP for specific categories or territories. Products bearing the Company’s brands are sold across a variety of distribution channels. The licensees are generally responsible for designing, manufacturing and distributing the licensed products. The Company supports its brands with marketing, advertising and promotional campaigns designed to increase brand awareness. Additionally, the Company provides its licensees with coordinated trend direction to enhance product appeal and help build and maintain brand integrity.  
 Globally, the Company has over 60 DTR licenses and more than 450 total licenses. Licensees are selected based upon the Company’s belief that such licensees will be able to produce and sell quality products in the categories and distribution channels of their specific expertise and that they are capable of exceeding minimum sales targets and royalties that the Company generally requires for each brand. This licensing strategy is designed to permit the Company to operate its licensing business, leverage its core competencies of marketing and brand management with minimal working capital. The majority of the Company’s licensing agreements include minimum guaranteed royalty revenue which provides the Company with greater visibility into future cash flows. As of January 1, 2021, the Company had approximately $381 million of aggregate guaranteed royalty revenue over the terms of its existing contracts excluding renewals. 
 In the past, a key initiative in the Company’s global brand expansion plans was the formation of international joint ventures. The strategy in forming international joint ventures is to partner with best-in-class, local partners to bring the Company’s brands to market more quickly and efficiently, generating greater short- and long-term value from its IP, than the Company believes is possible if it were to build-out wholly-owned operations ourselves across a multitude of regional or local offices. Since September 2008, the Company has established the following international joint ventures: Iconix China, Iconix Latin America, Iconix Europe, Iconix India, Iconix Canada, Iconix Australia, Iconix Southeast Asia, Iconix Israel, Iconix Middle East, Umbro China, Danskin China, Starter China, and Lee Cooper China.  The Company currently maintains a 100% ownership interest in Iconix China, Iconix Latin America and Iconix Canada. In 2020, The Company sold all of its interest in Umbro China and Starter China and entered an agreement to sell all its interest Lee Cooper China, which was completed in the first quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. 
 The Company’s primary goal of maximizing the value of its IP also includes, in certain instances, the sale to third parties of a brand’s trademark in specific territories or categories. As such, the Company evaluates potential offers to acquire some or all of a brand’s IP by comparing whether the offer is more valuable than the Company’s estimate of the current and potential revenue streams to be earned via the Company’s traditional licensing model. Further, as part of the Company’s evaluation process it also considers whether or not the buyer’s future development of the brand may help to expand the brand’s overall recognition and global revenue potential.

In 2020, the Company signed new licensees for the Royal Velvet brand for accent and area rugs, utility bedding both in the US and Canada, and for window treatments in the US and Canada.  
 Fieldcrest. Fieldcrest has been the choice for quality bedding and bath since the late 19th Century. A brand rich in heritage, Fieldcrest is foundational luxury for the modern guest.  The Company acquired Fieldcrest in 2007. From 2005 until the agreement expired under its terms on January 31, 2020, the Fieldcrest brand had been licensed exclusively to Target in the United States. In 2019, the Company has entered into a license agreement for all home textiles. In 2020, the Company signed a new agreement for the Fieldcrest brand for accent and area rugs in the US. The brand has recently increased its retail footprint in JC Penney.

In February 2009, the Company signed a DTR license with Costco Wholesale Corporation, (“Costco”) for certain Charisma products to be sold in Costco stores in the United States and other countries.

In 2020, the Company signed three new licensees for the Charisma brand: for memory foam pillows and mattresses in the US and Canada; for newborn children in the US and Canada; and for area and accent rugs in the US.  The Company continues to pursue opportunities to expand the brand into new categories.

Waverly’s distinctive color palette and accessible home decor allows consumers to mix and match fabrics offering a custom-designed look at an affordable price.  The Company acquired Waverly in October 2008.  Waverly has two DTR agreements in the United States: with Wal-Mart for the Waverly Inspirations Collection covering fabrics and craft, which Walmart extended in 2019 for two additional years, and with the Christmas Tree Shop for the Waverly Home Collection.  Waverly also has wholesale licensees in the United States for products including fabric, window treatments, décor, and bedding that are sold through retailers such as Jo-Ann’s, Lowe’s, JCPenney, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Belk, as well as specialty and off-price retailers.

Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries
Iconix China.  In September 2008, the Company and Novel Fashions Holdings Limited (“Novel”), formed a joint venture, Iconix China, to develop, exploit and market the Company’s brands in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (together, “Greater China”). In the initial phase of the joint venture, Iconix China sought to maximize brand monetization through investment, whereby Iconix China received a minority equity stake in local operating companies in exchange for the rights to one or more of the Company’s brands in Greater China and brand management support. Pursuant to the terms of this transaction, the Company contributed to Iconix China substantially all rights to its brands in Greater China and contributed $2.0 million, and Novel contributed $17 million to Iconix China.  
Iconix China successfully placed several brands into joint ventures including Candie’s and Marc Ecko Cut & Sew with Shanghai La Chapelle Fashion Co. Ltd (HK 6116); London Fog with China Outfitters (HK1146); Material Girl with Ningbo Peacebird; Ed Hardy with Landmark International; and Ecko Unltd. with Xi Ha Clothing. In April 2016, the Company sold its interest in TangLi International, Ltd. (Ed Hardy China). In 2020, the Company rescinded trademark rights for Marc Ecko Cut & Sew with Shanghai La Chapelle Fashion Co. Ltd. 
 In March 2015, the Company purchased all equity interests in Iconix China owned by its partner, increasing the Company’s ownership of Iconix China from 50% to 100%. Subsequently, the Company secured traditional licensing agreements or sold its ownership interests in greater China for many of its brands including Umbro, Joe Boxer, Rocawear, Rampage, Danskin and Starter. 
 Iconix Latin America.  In December 2008, the Company formed a joint venture partnership (“Iconix Latin America”) with New Brands, an affiliate of the Falic Group, to develop, exploit, market and license the Company’s brands in the Latin American territory comprising of Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean. In February 2014, the Company purchased from New Brands its 50% interest in Iconix Latin America for $42.0 million, increasing the Company’s ownership to 100%. Today, Iconix Latin America has over fifty licenses, including key DTR relationships with Falabella, Wal-Mart and Suburbia.  Licensed brands in this territory include Candie’s, Joe Boxer, London Fog, Mossimo, Ocean Pacific, Danskin/Danskin Now, Starter, Zoo York, Ecko Unltd., Ed Hardy, Cannon, and Fieldcrest, among others.
 Iconix Canada.  In June 2013, the Company contributed substantially all rights to its wholly-owned and controlled brands in Canada into two entities: Ico Brands L.P. (“Ico Brands”) and Iconix Canada L.P. (“Ico Canada,” and together with Ico Brands, “Iconix Canada”). Shortly thereafter, through their acquisitions of limited partnership and general partnership interests, Buffalo International ULC and its affiliates purchased a 50% interest in Iconix Canada.  In July 2017, the Company purchased from Buffalo its 50% interest in Iconix Canada for $19.0 million plus 50% of the net asset value of Iconix Canada (estimated to be approximately $2.0 million), increasing the Company’s ownership to 100%.  Iconix Canada has many licenses, for key brands such as Ecko Unltd., Danskin, London Fog, Rampage, Zoo York, Umbro, Fieldcrest, Royal Velvet, and Waverly. 
 Umbro China.  In July 2019, pursuant to the operating agreement, the Company reacquired the 5% ownership interest in Umbro China from MH Umbro International Co. Limited, its joint venture partner, for approximately $1.3 million.  As a result of that transaction, the Company maintained 100% ownership interest in Umbro China. In July 2020, the Company completed the sale of Umbro China. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a gain of $59.6 million, which has been recorded within Operating Income in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations.
 International Joint Ventures
 The formation and administration of international joint ventures have been a central and ongoing component of our business since 2008. The Company established and maintains the following international joint ventures: Iconix Europe, Iconix India, Iconix Australia, Iconix Southeast Asia, Iconix Israel, Iconix Middle East, and Danskin China. The Company’s primary purpose in forming international joint ventures has been to bring its brands to market more quickly and efficiently, generating greater short- and long-term value from its IP.  This approach enabled its brands to more rapidly increase licensing revenue, market share and profitability than what the Company believes it could have achieved on its own. 
 To get what we believe are best-in-class local partners to invest in and represent the Company’s brands in their respective territories, the Company offers its partner the ability to buy equity interests in the IP. These equity interests provide the Company’s partners with the necessary incentive to devote management time and resources to the brands. By leveraging the partners’ local market expertise, retail relationships, wholesale networks, business contacts and staff, the Company has significantly grown licensing royalties in key global markets and maintained stricter enforcement against counterfeit products. As these businesses in each territory reach sufficient scale to support the Company’s full business structure of brand management, marketing, licensing, acquisitions and finance, the Company may consider acquiring control or full ownership of the joint ventures, where possible, as was the case in Latin America in 2014, in China in 2015 and Canada in 2017.

Licensing Strategy
 The Company’s principal business strategy is to maximize the value of its brands by entering into strategic license agreements with best-in-class licensees that are responsible for designing, manufacturing and distributing the licensed products. Through our licensing business model, we have substantially eliminated inventory risk and reduced the operating exposure associated with traditional fully vertically integrated businesses, thereby resulting in attractive cash flows and operating margins. 
 The Company has over 450 licenses and has benefited from the model’s scalability, which enables the Company to leverage its existing infrastructure to support new business and brands. A key objective of the Company is to capitalize on its brand management expertise and relationships to build and maintain a diversified portfolio of consumer brands that generate revenues. Through our international partnerships, we have successfully built a vast network of licensees around the world.
 The Company licenses its brands across a broad range of product categories, including fashion apparel, footwear, accessories, sportswear, home furnishings and décor, and beauty and fragrance. The Company seeks licensees with the ability to produce and sell quality products in their licensed categories and to meet and exceed minimum sales and royalty payment thresholds. 
 The Company maintains DTR and traditional wholesale licenses. Typically, in a DTR license, the Company grants rights which may be exclusive to one of its brands to a single national retailer for a broad range of product categories. DTR licenses provide retailers with proprietary rights to national brands at favorable economics. In a traditional wholesale license, the Company grants certain rights to a specific brand to a single or small group of related product categories to a wholesale supplier, who is permitted to sell licensed products to multiple stores within an approved distribution channel. For example, the Company licenses the Charisma brand in the United States to numerous wholesale suppliers for sale and distribution primarily to department and specialty stores.
 10


The Company’s licenses typically require the licensee to pay the Company royalties based upon net sales with guaranteed minimum royalties. The Company’s licenses also typically require the licensees to pay to the Company certain minimum amounts for the advertising and marketing of the respective licensed brands. As of January 1, 2021, the Company and its joint ventures had a contractual right to receive approximately $381 million of aggregate minimum licensing revenue through the balance of their current licenses, excluding any renewals.
 The Company believes that coordination of brand presentation across product categories is critical to maintaining the strength and integrity of its brands. Accordingly, the Company typically maintains the right in its licenses to preview and approve all products, packaging and other presentations of the licensed mark. Moreover, in many of its licenses, prior to each season, representatives of the Company supply licensees with trend guidance as to the “look and feel” of the current trends for the season, including colors, fabrics, silhouettes and an overall style sensibility, and then work with licensees to coordinate the licensed products across the categories to maintain the cohesiveness of the brand’s overall presentation in the marketplace. Thereafter, the Company obtains and approves (or objects and requires modification to) product and packaging provided by each licensee on an on-going basis.  In addition, the Company communicates with its licensees throughout the year to obtain and review reporting of sales and calculation and payment of royalties.
 Marketing
 The Company believes marketing is a critical element in maximizing brand value to its consumers, licensees and to the Company. The Company’s in-house marketing department conceives and produces omni-channel marketing initiatives for the Company’s brands. These initiatives aim to increase brand awareness, positive perception and drive-engagement and conversion. The Company believes that its national campaigns result in increased sales and consumer recognition of its brands. 
 The Company has organized its marketing structure to allow for ongoing updates to its marketing campaigns based upon market trends. Marketing consists of four areas: Social and digital marketing, public relations, creative content generation and brand management. The Company uses its in-house talent to create compelling 360° marketing campaigns that include social/digital marketing, print, outdoor, celebrity, influencers, bloggers and other innovative strategies. It also will utilize outside agencies when needed to supplement. In addition to building omni-channel campaigns, the Company works with major retail partners to provide assets for online, digital/ social and in-store marketing.
 Many of the Company’s license agreements require the payment of an advertising royalty by the licensee, and in certain cases, the Company’s licensees are required to supplement the marketing of the Company’s brands by performing additional advertising through trade, cooperative or other sources.
 Direct-to-retail licenses
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s largest DTR license was with Kohl’s for the Candie’s and Mudd brands which represented approximately 9% of total revenue for the period. As detailed below, these arrangements expired on January 31, 2021. The Company also has DTR agreements under various terms at Amazon for Starter and Costco for the Charisma brand.
 Kohl’s licenses
 Revenue generated by the Company’s two licenses with Kohl’s accounted for, in the aggregate, 9% and 11% of the Company’s revenue for Fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following is a description of these licenses.
 Candie’s. In December 2004, the Company entered into a license agreement with Kohl’s for an initial term of five years with options to renew. Pursuant to this license, Kohl’s has the exclusive right to design, manufacture, sell and distribute a broad range of products under the Candie’s trademark, including women’s, and juniors’ apparel, and accessories (except prescription eyewear). The license provided for guaranteed minimum royalties and advertising payments that Kohl’s is obligated to pay the Company for each contract year.  The exclusive license expired under its terms on January 31, 2021. A non-exclusive arrangement continues through January 30, 2022.    
 Mudd. In November 2008, the Company entered into a license agreement with Kohl’s granting Kohl’s the exclusive right to design, manufacture, sell and distribute a broad range of Mudd-branded apparel and accessories in the United States and its territories. The exclusive license expired under its terms on January 31, 2021. A non-exclusive arrangement continues through January 30, 2022. 
Wholesale Licenses
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s largest wholesale licensee was Centric Brands Inc. for the Buffalo brand, which represented approximately 10% of total revenue for the period.

Competition
 The Company’s proprietary brands are all subject to extensive competition from various domestic and foreign brands. These competitors compete with the Company’s licensees in terms of design, quality, price, product, advertising and service. We believe that our strong brand management platform and proven international partnerships as well as our experienced management team differentiate our Company from our competitors.
 Each brand has many competitors specific to certain distribution channels that span a broad variety of product categories, including the fashion apparel, home furnishings and decor, sports and entertainment industries. For example, Candie’s competes with respect to young women’s and juniors fast-fashion in the United States at the mid-tier channel with national brands like Zara and H&M, Starter competes with brands like Russell Athletic and C9 in the athletic apparel category, and Avia and And1 competes in the footwear category at the mass-tier channel. Umbro competes with global brands like Nike and Adidas in active-wear and with global and local brands in technical soccer categories.  Additionally, a significant portion of our brands also compete with big box retailers “private-label” and/or “exclusive” brands.
 The Company also faces competition in securing retail and wholesale licenses. Companies owning established brands may decide to enter licensing arrangements with retailers or wholesalers similar to the ones the Company currently has in place, therefore creating direct competition. Similarly, the retailers that currently license our brands may decide to develop their own private labels and/or purchase brands rather than enter into license agreements with the Company.
 Lastly, in America, the Company competes for acquisitions with traditional apparel, consumer and entertainment brand companies, financial buyers and other brand management companies. Throughout the rest of the world, the Company also competes for the acquisition of global brands with strategic and financial buyers.
 Intellectual Property
 We believe that the Company’s worldwide IP portfolio, which includes trademarks, service marks, copyrights and other proprietary information, is our most valuable asset. As of December 31, 2020, we owned nearly 6,700 trademark and service mark registrations and applications – over 450 of which are domestic and over 6,2
00 of which are foreign. Trademarks and associated marks are registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in other countries throughout the world in block letter and/or logo formats, as well as in combination with a variety of ancillary marks for use with respect to a variety of product categories, including footwear, apparel, fragrance, handbags, watches and various other goods and services, including in some cases, home accessories and electronics.  In addition, the Company owns numerous copyrights in its iconic Waverly and Joe Boxer patterns and designs. The Company also owns over 1,500 domain names worldwide and registers key domain names containing its trademarks.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of 101 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees. Our employees are primarily located in New York, NY, as well as London and Manchester, England. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
 Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
