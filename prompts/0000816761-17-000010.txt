Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview. Teradata Corporation ("we," "us," "Teradata," or the "Company") is a global leader in analytics solutions and services. We empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes through analytics at scale, enabled by our technology. We help customers know how and where to use analytics and data to drive business value. We also help customers architect their analytical ecosystem to match technology choices to business needs, and we deploy analytics technology that businesses can scale to meet their growing data analytic needs. Our strategy is to deliver business value by being the best analytical partner to the world’s leading firms across a broad set of industries who have high-priority and complex analytical needs. 
Our offerings include analytics solutions, ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions. These solutions include software and hardware technology components such as data warehousing, big data, and tools for data integration, data discovery, and business intelligence. Our services help companies architect, manage, and 
4

integrate their complex and ever-changing analytic ecosystem, and include technology and data architecture consulting, analytic business consulting, open source consulting, and “as-a-service” offerings in the cloud. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive set of support services. In 2016, we announced our new Teradata EverywhereTM offering through which we provide our Teradata database software in a production-scale and deployment agnostic manner. As a result, we now offer our customers flexible deployment options on-premises, in a private cloud, in the public cloud, in the cloud at a Teradata data center or as a hybrid combination of these offerings.Teradata operates from numerous locations within the United States ("U.S.") with the primary locations being Dayton, Ohio; Johns Creek (Atlanta), Georgia; and Rancho Bernardo (San Diego), California. In addition, we have sales, services, research and development, and administrative offices located in 45 countries. 
For the full year ended December 31, 2016, we had net income of $125 million and total revenues of $2.322 billion, of which approximately 97% was derived from the data and analytics segment and 3% from the marketing applications segment, which was sold on July 1, 2016. For financial information about these segments and geographic information, see “Note 11—Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
History. Teradata was formed in 1979 as a Delaware corporation, driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data. In 1984, Teradata established a massively parallel relational database management system that enabled companies to easily scale their data management needs, revolutionizing data analysis for customers. In 1991, AT&T Corp. ("AT&T") acquired NCR Corporation ("NCR") and, later that year, the combined company of AT&T / NCR purchased Teradata.
In 1996, AT&T spun off NCR (including Teradata) to form the independent, publicly-traded NCR. On September 30, 2007, the independent, publicly-traded Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) was created when NCR was effectively separated into two independent, publicly-traded companies through the distribution of 100% of its Teradata data warehousing business to shareholders of NCR.
Since that time, we have increased our investments and focus to be the best analytical partner to the world’s leading firms. We continue to invest to extend our research and development in analytics and analytic consulting.
On July 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our marketing applications business to exclusively focus on our analytics solutions business, in support of our transformation plans.
Industry and Market Opportunity
Our view is that analytics is and will continue to be a management priority for most companies and, in particular, for the majority of our customers. We believe we have a large market opportunity, as Teradata’s strategy encompasses the multi-billion dollar and growing markets of data management, analytic tools and consulting, and packaged analytics, as well as the related consulting and accompanying maintenance services. As organizations work to manage the evolution to increasing digital environments, we believe that they will need help leveraging analytics to deliver high-impact business outcomes. We also believe that companies will need help to implement the right analytic ecosystem architecture, leveraging both commercial and open source technologies. We have tailored Teradata's offerings to meet these needs and to help companies navigate the multitude of ecosystem options, as well as various alternatives for deployment.
We are focused on the 500 largest analytic opportunities globally as we believe that this portion of the market will have the highest growth in the amount of data analytic processing power they consume. We plan to grow revenue in this market segment by expanding our existing customers' analytical ecosystems as well as adding new customers. Overall, we believe that key differentiators for Teradata include the following:

• | Proven experience in solving complex analytical problems,


• | Real-world expertise deploying ecosystems and analytics, and


• | Leading production-scale, deployment agnostic technologies.

Customers. Our new strategy prioritizes our sales focus on business users, as well as technology buyers at leading companies across a broad set of industries, including banking/financial services, communications (including telecommunications, e-business, and media and entertainment), energy, government, insurance and healthcare, 
5

manufacturing, oil and gas, retail, travel and transportation logistics, and utilities. These industries provide a good fit for our analytics solutions and services, as they tend to have the greatest analytic potential, with large and growing data volumes, and expanding sources of data, complex data management requirements, or large and varied groups of users. 
The extent to which any given customer contributes to our revenues generally varies significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. Therefore, a customer with a large order in one quarter is likely to generate additional revenue for Teradata in subsequent periods as we provide support services and additional capacity as their analytical ecosystem evolves and grows to meet their business requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top ten customers collectively accounted for approximately 15% of our total revenues. Moreover, Teradata’s revenue can vary considerably from period to period given the different growth and purchasing patterns of our existing customers’ data warehouse systems, discovery platforms and data management platforms as well as the variable timing of new customer orders. Due to the size and complexity of these transactions (purchases), the sales cycle for a new analytic solution is often fairly long (typically more than a year). Historically, our results in any particular quarter have generally been dependent on our ability to generate a relatively small number of large orders for that quarter. However, we are actively converting customers from perpetual to over time pricing models, which will likely create many more smaller, but more frequent transactions, which will likely decrease the overall variability in the timing of our revenue as we transition to new operating expense-based deployment and purchasing options.
Our Strategy
Teradata is focusing on addressing the needs of the analytics future, as we enable organizations to deliver value through analytics. Through our consultative approach, focused on leading with business outcomes, our goal is to serve as a trusted advisor to both the business and technical leaders in our customers’ organizations. Our business analytics solutions are ideally suited for the world’s largest companies who have the most complex analytics requirements and the need to scale. Teradata’s focus is on being “business outcome led, technology enabled”, as we deliver business value through analytics, as a trusted advisor to both business buyers and IT buyers. Our strategic approach is to make it easy to buy and grow with Teradata. We believe that this strategic approach will best position us to be our customers’ trusted advisor and analytic partner of choice.
Our Solutions 
There are three key solutions in our portfolio which support our strategy and which drive consumption of Teradata database software: Hybrid Cloud Solutions, Business Analytics Solutions and Ecosystem Architecture Consulting. In addition, we offer support services to allow customers to maximize availability and better leverage the value of their investments in Teradata solutions.
Hybrid Cloud Solutions
Our Hybrid Cloud Solutions deliver an end-to-end analytical ecosystem across a hybrid cloud architecture. Our offerings provide the ability to manage and access data across all deployment options, including: 

• | Teradata Software Sold on Public Clouds for the segment in the market that wants to purchase Teradata software and deploy it in the public cloud of their choice.


• | Teradata Managed Cloud Solutions for the market segment looking for a fully managed service. Our Managed Cloud solutions make it easy for customers; by allowing them to focus on their business while our skilled data scientists and data management experts manage the customers' analytical ecosystem for them.


• | Hybrid Cloud Solutions blending both on-premises and cloud environments. We expect the majority of companies to deploy hybrid cloud architectures.

Our core Teradata database remains a key component within Hybrid Cloud Solutions-it is a critical element in delivering our best-in-class analytics at scale. It provides the foundation for our unique ability to support and manage a wide range of mixed workloads and analytic data functions. Another key component is our Teradata Intelliflex™ Platform, which is our next-generation massively parallel processing ("MPP") architecture. Its fabric-based structure provides multi-dimensional scalability, enabling companies to add processing power and storage 
6

capacity independently to meet their current and changing business requirements. A key technology in Intelliflex is the use of hybrid storage that combines Solid State Drive ("SSD") and Hard Disk Drive ("HDD") technologies to optimize performance while appropriately managing costs. Teradata IntelliFlex brings the agile and flexible growth benefits of our cloud offerings to the on-premises environment for our customers.
Business Analytics Solutions
Through our Business Analytics Solutions, we provide a consultative approach to identify and deliver value to business buyers supported by analytic business consulting, data science, and repeatable intellectual property ("IP"). Our Business Analytics Solutions include:

• | Analytic Business Consulting to innovate with our customers on large, complex problems to deliver high-impact business outcomes.

Our business consultants work with customers to discover insights in high-impact areas where we can deliver positive business outcomes. In some cases, we work with customers in areas where we already have experience and assets to leverage, and can accelerate their time to value through our proven methods, IP, and technologies. In other cases, we work with customers to identify and solve new challenges, while capturing new assets. We utilize our global best practices including Business Value Frameworks and our Rapid Analytic Consulting Engagement ("RACE") agile methodology.

• | IP Capture and Management so solutions built for our customers are developed once, and then systematically leveraged, to support future customers. This approach is designed to provide rapid return on investment for customers.

Ecosystem Architecture Consulting
Our Ecosystem Architecture Consulting helps customers build an optimized analytical ecosystem independent of technology, leveraging Teradata, open source and other commercial solutions. Here, our consultants guide chief information officers and their teams in creating the optimal analytical ecosystem for our customers, based on our collective understanding of enterprise-grade scaled analytics, data warehousing, and the open source ecosystem.
Support Services
Our customer services offerings include both proactive and reactive services, including installation, maintenance, monitoring, back-up, and recovery services to allow customers to maximize availability and better leverage the value of their investments in Teradata solutions. They assist customers 24x7x365 for both on-site and remote support. Our customer services team is highly experienced and provides a single point of contact and delivery for the deployment, support and ongoing management of Teradata solutions around the world.
Partners, Marketing and Distribution Channels
Strategic Partnerships. We seek to leverage our sales and marketing reach by partnering with leading global and regional systems integrators, independent software vendors, Hadoop distributors, and consultants, which we believe complement our analytics data platforms.

• | Alliance Partners-Strategic partnerships are a key factor in our ability to leverage the value and expand the scope of our analytic solutions in the marketplace. Our partner program is focused on working collaboratively with independent software vendors in several areas, including tools, data and application integration solutions, data mining, analytics, business intelligence, specific analytic and industry solutions. Our goal is to provide choices to our customers with partner offerings that are optimized and certified with our solutions, and fit within the customer’s analytic environment.


• | Systems Integrators-We also work with a range of systems integrators and consultants that engage in the design, implementation and integration of analytic solutions and analytic applications for our joint clients.

7

Our strategic partnerships with select global consulting and systems integration firms provide broad industry and technology expertise in the design of business solutions that leverage Teradata technology to enable enterprise analytics. Our strategic global consulting and systems integration partners include Accenture Limited, Capgemini Group, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Deloitte LLP, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), and Wipro Limited.
Sales and Marketing. We primarily sell and market our solutions and services through a direct sales force, and are aligning our sales teams to best address the 500 largest analytic opportunities globally. We are applying differential resourcing to ensure that our sales and marketing investments are aligned with the customers’ long-term value to Teradata. We have approximately 80% of our employees in customer-facing and/or revenue driving roles (including sales, consulting and customer service, and product engineering).
We support our sales force with marketing and training programs which are designed to:

• | grow awareness, highlighting our technology leadership and differentiation, and our consulting expertise in the market,


• | create demand for our products and services,


• | educate the sales force to build skills and knowledge, as well as


• | provide a robust set of tools for use by our direct sales force.

We employ a broad range of marketing strategies including programs to inform and educate customers and prospects, the media, industry analysts, academics and other third-party influencers. These strategies include targeted, account-based marketing, our global website, webinars, physical and virtual trade shows and conferences, public and media relations, social media, and an extensive customer reference program.
Sources of Materials. Our hardware components are assembled and configured by Flextronics International Ltd. (“Flextronics”). Our platform line is designed to leverage the components from industry leaders. Our data storage devices and memory components utilize industry-standard technologies, but are selected and configured to work optimally with our software and hardware platform. Flextronics also procures a wide variety of components used in the assembly process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure business continuity of supply. Given our strategy to outsource product assembly activities to Flextronics and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flextronics or at a supplier, or a global shortage of components, could impact the timing or profitability of customer shipments.
Competition. We compete in a large and growing market that is attractive to both legacy and new competitors. Our competition includes new analytics services companies, cloud vendors and open source providers, as well as large traditional competitors, such as IBM and Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"). We believe our focus on business outcomes and proven success will enable us to successfully compete and win with the largest analytic opportunities in the market. We believe our proven architecture for both structured and unstructured data, integrated solutions with high-performing and scalable technology, flexible deployment options in the cloud and on-premises, deep and broad consulting and support services capabilities, strong customer relationships, and our successful track record will collectively enable us to continue to compete successfully. We also compete successfully in the marketplace by offering our ecosystem architecture consulting to help customers bring together our leading software, hardware and related services with open source offerings. For more information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Competitors take different technical and integration approaches to addressing data analytic needs, and therefore they often recommend a different architecture than we do. We believe that our customers recognize the advantages of our technologies and our approach as described above.
Key factors used to evaluate competitors in these markets include: data analytics experience; business outcome delivery; hybrid cloud offerings and experience; customer references; technology leadership; product quality; performance, scalability, availability and manageability; support and consulting services capabilities; management 
8

of technologies in a complex analytical ecosystem; industry knowledge; and total cost of ownership. We believe we have a competitive advantage in providing complete, integrated, and optimized analytic data platforms and analytic 
services that address customers’ business, technical and architecture requirements. Our differentiation is especially strong with customers that have mission critical, complex, large scale environments and requirements.
Many companies participate in adjacent areas of the analytics market, such as enterprise analytic and business intelligence application software. The status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete. Our products also complement offerings of some of our competitors, with whom we have formed partnerships to work with their business intelligence and application software businesses. Examples of these companies include both IBM and Oracle, due to their acquisitions of other business intelligence and consulting companies in recent years.
Seasonality. Historically our sales are seasonal, in line with capital spending patterns of our customers, with lower revenue typically in the first quarter and higher revenue generally in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing and mix of product sales. Typically, cash provided by operating activities is higher in the first half of the year due to the higher receivable balances at December 31 and the increase in deferred revenue resulting from the timing of annual renewals of our maintenance support agreements. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months. These factors, among others as more fully described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results.
Research and Development ("R&D"). We remain focused on designing and developing Hybrid Cloud Solutions that anticipate our customers' evolving technological and delivery needs. As we seek improvements in our products and services, we also consider our customers' current needs as we design our new technology so that new generations of the Teradata database software and platform technology are compatible with prior generations of our technology. We believe our extensive R&D workforce is one of our core strengths. The global R&D team is located in multiple facilities around the world to take advantage of global engineering talent. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures, which may include complementary strategic acquisitions, in order to help support the flow of innovative, high-quality products, cloud-based offerings, services and applications, which is vital to our leading competitive position. For information regarding the accounting and costs included in R&D activities see “Note 1-Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Intellectual Property and Technology. The Company owns 702 patents in the U.S. and 38 patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of the Company’s U.S. patents. Many of the patents that we own are licensed to others, and we are licensed to use certain patents owned by others. While our portfolio of patents and patent applications in aggregate is of significant value to our Company, we do not believe that any particular individual patent is by itself of material importance to our business as a whole.
In addition, the Company owns copyrights and trade secrets in its vast code base which makes up all of the Teradata software products including analytic data platforms and analytic applications. Teradata’s software products reflect the investment of hundreds of person-years of development work.
The source code versions of our products are protected as trade secrets and, in all major markets, as unpublished copyright works. We also protect our rights in all of our software products and related intellectual property; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. The Company owns the Teradata® and Aster® trademarks, which are registered in the U.S. and in many foreign countries, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks. 
Employees. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 10,093 employees globally. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel. 
Properties and Facilities. Our corporate headquarters is located in Dayton, Ohio, although our Johns Creek (Atlanta), Georgia; and Rancho Bernardo (San Diego), California facilities are also primary locations (within the 
9

U.S.). As of December 31, 2016, we operated 114 facilities in 45 countries throughout the world. We own our Rancho Bernardo research and development complex, while all of our other facilities are leased.
