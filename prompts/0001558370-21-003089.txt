Industry Overview
The HME industry provides critical medical products and recurring supply services, designed to improve quality of life, to patients in their homes. The HME industry allows patients with complex and chronic conditions to transition to their homes and achieve a greater level of independence, which is often lost in facility-based settings. While the industry has traditionally treated outpatient and lower acuity ailments, recent technological improvements have helped make higher acuity treatment more affordable and, in turn, have allowed the industry to shift to the treatment of more advanced acute ailments. The equipment and supplies that HME providers deliver can support respiratory, mobility, diabetes management, nutritional and other general home needs (bathroom needs, nutritional needs, hospital beds, among others).
According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the HME industry grew from $40 billion in 2010 to $56 billion in 2018 (representing a 4.3% CAGR), of which the Company estimated its total addressable market for its sleep therapy, oxygen services, mobility products and hospice HME business lines was approximately $12 billion to $15 billion in 2018. During that time Medicaid data shows a continued shift of long-term services and supports spending into the home, with 57% of that spending going to home and community-based services in 2016. According to CMS, the HME market is projected to continue to grow at a 6.1% CAGR over the next nine years. As a result of the Company’s recent diabetes and home medical supplies acquisitions, the Company believes it has more than doubled its total addressable market to more than $25 billion. Primary drivers of continued market growth include:

● | Aging U.S. Population: The population of adults aged 65 and older in the United States, a significant group of end users of AdaptHealth’s products and services, is expected to continue to grow and thus grow AdaptHealth’s market opportunity. According to CMS, in the United States, the population of adults between the ages of 65 and 84 is expected to grow at a 2.5% CAGR through 2030, while the population of adults over 85 is projected to grow at a 2.9% CAGR during that same time period. Not only is the elderly population expected to grow, but it is also expected to make up a larger percentage of the total U.S. population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. geriatric population was approximately 15% of the total population in 2014 and is expected to grow to approximately 24% of the total population by 2060. This growth emphasizes the need for companies, such as AdaptHealth, to provide efficient and effective equipment to a patient’s home, shortening the amount of time that the patient population spends in an inpatient setting. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing Prevalence of Chronic Conditions: HME is necessary to help treat significant health issues affecting millions of Americans. For example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2014 with over 15 million reported diagnoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”). Congestive heart failure, another condition where HME plays a role in successful treatment, impacts more than five million Americans, according to the CDC. The CDC also estimates that more than 9% of the U.S. population suffers from diabetes. AdaptHealth believes that CGM and diabetes represent a $16 billion market segment. AdaptHealth believes that the CGM market could grow by 18% to $3.4 billion by 2022, and the insulin pump market could grow by 12% to $2.2 billion by 2022. Finally, according to the American Sleep Apnea Association, obstructive sleep apnea affects 20 million people across the nation, with 15 million undiagnosed, including many individuals younger than 65 years old. As these conditions continue to increase in prevalence, the Company expects that the demand within the HME industry for suppliers, such as AdaptHealth, will grow with it, positioning the Company to be able to expand its market reach and penetration. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advancements in Technology: Continuing development of technology and supply logistics has enabled more efficient and effective delivery of care in the home along with the collection of data that can be used for ongoing treatment. This, in turn, has helped grow AdaptHealth’s total addressable market. With improvements in technology, physicians are often able to monitor patients’ adherence to prescribed therapy, which previously required admission to a facility. With the advancement of technology, physicians are more confident in shifting care to a patient’s home and patients are more comfortable receiving care in this setting. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Increasing Prevalence of and Preference for In-Home Treatments: The number of conditions that can be treated in the home continues to grow, with recent additions including chronic wound care, sleep testing, dialysis and chemotherapy. In-home care is also increasingly becoming the preferred method of treatment, particularly for the elderly population. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute, 90% of patients over age 55 have indicated a preference to receive care in the home rather than in an institutional setting. Patient preference is supported by data that has shown that the efficacy of home care is often equivalent to that of facility-based care. The home setting provides comfort and convenience for a population that often faces barriers to receiving effective traditional treatment, such as transportation and adherence. By bringing the care to them, the elderly population can maintain a higher quality of life while still receiving high-quality care and equipment. As a result, more companies within the healthcare industry that are primarily facility-based are beginning to shift towards in-home offerings. AdaptHealth believes that medical supplies to the home represents a $10 billion segment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home Care is the Lowest Cost Setting: Not only can in-home care be just as effective as care delivered in a facility-based setting, but it has also proven to be more cost effective. The cost effectiveness of in-home care is particularly important within the context of government pressures to lower the cost of care, pushing payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and clinicians to seek care settings that are less costly than hospitals and inpatient facilities. On a daily basis, home healthcare has been estimated by Cain Brothers & Company, LLC to be approximately seven times less expensive than care provided in skilled nursing facilities, the closest acuity site of care. Home care generally offers a significant cost reduction opportunity relative to facility-based care without sacrificing quality.

Business Strategy
AdaptHealth’s strategy is to grow its revenue while expanding margins through targeted strategies for organic growth as well as opportunistic acquisitions that take advantage of AdaptHealth’s scalable, integrated technology platform.

● | Drive Market Share Gains in the HME Market: AdaptHealth plans to leverage its technological and clinical advantages as well as its relationships with key constituents across the HME supply chain to deepen its presence in the HME market. AdaptHealth has built a strong network of highly diversified referral relationships that its sales force will continue to grow to help expand market penetration in certain geographies. Primary referral sources include acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist offices, skilled nursing facilities and hospice operators, with no one source accounting for a material portion of its annual revenue as of December 31, 2020. AdaptHealth believes that maintaining and broadening these relationships will drive organic growth. AdaptHealth’s ability to provide many products across its contracted payors is particularly valuable, especially to providers and facilities that discharge patients with a variety of product needs and insurance coverages. While some of its HME competitors focus on certain specific product lines, AdaptHealth is able to offer a wide array of products to its customers. AdaptHealth believes that its strong referral relationships and broad product portfolio will help drive market share growth. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow through Acquisitions: The HME industry is highly fragmented, with more than 6,000 unique suppliers. AdaptHealth believes that ongoing reimbursement changes will continue the consolidation trend in the HME industry that has accelerated in recent years. We believe that, in the current environment, companies with the ability to scale operations possess competitive advantages that can drive volume to their platforms. As one of a limited number of national HME companies, AdaptHealth plans to continue to evaluate acquisitions and execute upon attractive opportunities to help drive growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve Profitability with Technology-Enabled Platform: AdaptHealth plans to leverage its combined integrated technology system (based upon third-party applications and proprietary software products) to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency in its current business and the businesses AdaptHealth acquires. Through December 31, 2020, AdaptHealth has deployed its technology solutions with respect to the majority of its acquisitions and have worked to establish the ability to improve logistics performance and operating margins. The acquisition of AeroCare combines two of the industry’s leading technology platforms, which 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AdaptHealth intends to continue to improve to enhance its communications with referral sources and provide better patient service. Further, AdaptHealth believes both platforms are leaders in tech-enabled devices and are positioned to lead the shift to connected healthcare through our offerings of various connected devices designed to drive early interventions, reduce hospitalizations and improve outcomes, making AdaptHealth a value-add partner to payors, providers and patients.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand Product Portfolio: In addition to AdaptHealth’s other growth initiatives, AdaptHealth also plans to augment its product portfolio to help drive growth. While AdaptHealth offers a suite of products to its referrers and patients, it has identified several key expansion opportunities, including products in the respiratory device, respiratory medicine, diabetes management, orthotic bracing and hospice HME markets. AdaptHealth believes that the acquisition of AeroCare greatly enhances the depth of its product offering in respiratory devices and medicine, allowing it to further address key clinical conditions which, in turn, is expected to help drive growth across AdaptHealth’s customer base. AdaptHealth’s scale has helped it to be successful in the past when bidding on Medicare contracts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize Value-Based Reimbursement Arrangements: AdaptHealth’s broad HME service offerings and technology-enabled infrastructure provide it with the opportunity to enter into value-based reimbursement arrangements with its payors and referrers (including large multi-specialty physician groups, hospital systems, and accountable care organizations) pursuant to which AdaptHealth provides certain HME services on a per-patient, per-month basis or shares in reduction of HME service costs over baseline periods. Such arrangements are attractive to risk-bearing providers (such as capitated medical groups) and payors wishing to reduce administrative costs related to HME services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
AdaptHealth believes that the following strengths will continue to enable it to provide high-quality products and services to its customers and to create value.

● | Differentiated Technology-Enabled Platform: Over the last five years, AdaptHealth has developed an integrated technology system (based upon leading third-party applications and proprietary software products), which it believes provides a competitive advantage within the HME industry. AdaptHealth’s integrated platform distinguishes itself from other industry participants by automating processes that can be complex, prone to mistakes and inefficient. AdaptHealth believes that its platform’s ease of use, improved compliance and automated, integrated workflow for delivery of care appeals to physicians and payors. Additionally, AdaptHealth believes its adoption of e-prescribing solutions enhances transparency and reduces clinical errors and delays. AdaptHealth believes such systems provide better patient service by reducing the time between an order’s receipt and the delivery of the products to the patient. AdaptHealth believes its model is scalable, supporting future organic growth while also allowing for timely on-boarding of acquisitions. AdaptHealth believes that this differentiated technology platform will help generate business from new clients, as other competitors either lack the resources to modernize their infrastructure or utilize systems which do not easily allow for changes from traditional, less automated models. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National Scale and Operational Excellence: Following AdaptHealth’s acquisition of AeroCare, AdaptHealth services approximately 3.0 million patients annually across all 50 states and performs over 29,000 equipment and supply deliveries a day from over 500 locations across 46 states. AdaptHealth has relationships with national healthcare distribution companies to drop ship certain HME products directly to patients’ homes in one to two days. AdaptHealth believes that its scale makes it attractive to payors as AdaptHealth is able to service its patients across the nation. As of December 31, 2020, AdaptHealth has been able to build a network of more than 1,000 payors, including 10 national insurers. AdaptHealth’s payor network allows its organization to provide in-network rates for most prospective patients, unlike many of its competitors. AdaptHealth believes that this, in turn, promotes access to its services among patients, providers and facilities, which helps to support and grow its business. AdaptHealth has a broad distribution network to leverage with respect to timely and efficient delivery of products. AdaptHealth has strategically located small depots across the country based upon equipment volume and drive times to support its delivery fleet and help enhance operational success.

● | Experienced Management Team: AdaptHealth is led by a proven management team with significant experience in the HME and healthcare services industries. The team has domain knowledge within the industry having been employed at various healthcare organizations throughout their careers. Multiple members of the management team have also built independent HME companies and have the proven ability to scale a business within the HME industry. Additionally, several members of the management team have experience within their specific roles in both private and public company settings. Given the complexity of the highly regulated industry in which it operates, AdaptHealth believes that management’s experience is a meaningful differentiator relative to its competitors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proven M&A Success: AdaptHealth’s integrated technology platform includes scalable and centralized front-end and back office processes that facilitate the effective onboarding of potential acquisitions and help achieve cost synergies. AdaptHealth has demonstrated its ability to execute upon acquisitions, completing approximately 90 transactions from its founding through December 31, 2020. As AdaptHealth continues to grow, it expects to deploy incrementally more capital and integrate substantially larger targets over time, which in turn it expects will be a source of continued growth for AdaptHealth.

Company Operations
Product Offering. AdaptHealth delivers home medical equipment and supplies directly to a patient’s home upon discharge from a hospital and/or receipt of referral. The breadth of AdaptHealth’s products is particularly valuable to acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories and long-term care facilities that discharge patients with complex conditions and multiple product needs.
AdaptHealth is often paid a fixed monthly amount for certain HME products as designated by CMS or commercial payors, such as CPAP equipment, wheelchairs, hospital beds, oxygen concentrators, continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and other similar products. These sales accounted for approximately 28% of AdaptHealth’s net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
For resupply sale and one-time sale products, which include those deemed to be consumables, AdaptHealth receives a single payment upon sale of the product. These products, which include CPAP masks and related supplies, diabetes management supplies, wound care supplies, wheelchair cushions accessories, orthopedic bracing, breast pumps and supplies, walkers, commodes and canes, nutritional supplies and incontinence supplies, accounted for approximately 72% of AdaptHealth’s net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Supply Chain. AdaptHealth plays an important role in delivering HME products to patients in their homes. Manufacturers of home medical equipment sell and ship their products to AdaptHealth directly. AdaptHealth also contracts with national healthcare distribution companies to ship certain HME products directly to patients’ homes. These distributors invoice AdaptHealth for the cost of shipped products at the time of sale. AdaptHealth receives referrals from a variety of sources, such as acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist offices, skilled nursing facilities and hospice operators. AdaptHealth’s products are either shipped to patients’ homes by AdaptHealth-operated or contracted delivery trucks or shipped using proprietary or third-party distribution services. AdaptHealth bills payors and patients directly for the products that are delivered and for the services that are provided.
Operating Structure
Management. AdaptHealth is led by a proven management team with experience in the HME industry across a variety of healthcare organizations. AdaptHealth has a centralized approach for key business processes, including M&A activity, revenue cycle management, strategic purchases, payor contracting, finance, compliance, legal, human resources, IT and sales management. In addition, AdaptHealth has centralized many of the functions relating to its CPAP and other resupply businesses. However, AdaptHealth believes that the personalized nature of customer requirements and referral relationships, characteristic of the home healthcare business, mandate that it emphasize a localized operating structure as well. AdaptHealth focuses on regional management to respond promptly and effectively to local market demands and opportunities. AdaptHealth’s regional managers are responsible and accountable for maintaining and developing

relationships with referral sources, customer service for non-CPAP supply product lines and logistics for non-drop-shipped products.
Following the closing of the acquisition of AeroCare in February 2021, Stephen Griggs has joined Luke McGee as Co-Chief Executive Officer of AdaptHealth. 
IT. AdaptHealth has established an integrated, technology-enabled, centralized platform, distinguishing itself from many of its competitors who traditionally use less automated processes that are typically complex, can be prone to mistakes and are inefficient. AdaptHealth’s technology enables automated, compliant, and integrated workflow into patients’ delivery of care. AdaptHealth believes that this advanced technology platform provides it with a competitive advantage through its unique components that cater to patients and physicians. AdaptHealth believes that its technology platform has several characteristics that appeal to physicians, including its ease of use, the improved compliance it enables through its integrated systems and the automated, integrated workflow it provides for patients’ delivery of care. Additionally, AdaptHealth’s e-prescribing capabilities enhance transparency and reduce transcription and other errors. AdaptHealth believes that patients are also better served due to the efficiency from time of order to delivery and the seamless integration across points of care enabled by AdaptHealth’s platform. The integrated system also provides AdaptHealth management with critical information in a timely manner, allowing them to track performance levels company wide. AdaptHealth is in the process of replacing its mobile delivery software technology provided by a third party with AeroCare’s proprietary mobile delivery technology called OTL. This technology will allow AdaptHealth to add many features to its existing technology, such as delivery notification, patient satisfaction applications and referral source notifications. This application, combined with AdaptHealth’s data warehouse and evolving data lake, will allow AdaptHealth to build out a 360-degree view of its patients and activities, and will ultimately act as a fundamental component of the operating system of AdaptHealth.
AdaptHealth has formed close relationships with its third-party software providers, including Apacheta Corporation, Brightree, Parachute Health and SnapWorx, LLC, to optimize its HME workflow. An example of this optimization is AdaptHealth’s automated point-of-delivery technology, which tracks AdaptHealth’s drivers and produces paperless, secure delivery tickets which are uploaded directly to the patient’s file and available immediately on an enterprise-wide basis. In addition, to address ongoing and growing threats related to cyberattacks, AdaptHealth continues to deploy market leading defense tools to protect and secure its networks and data.
Revenue Cycle Management. AdaptHealth’s revenue cycle management and billing processes have both manual and computerized elements that are designed to maintain the integrity of revenue and accounts receivable. Third-party payors that can accommodate electronic claims submission, such as Medicare, certain state Medicaid payors and many commercial payors, are billed electronically on a daily basis. For other payors, who are unable to accept electronic submissions, AdaptHealth generates paper claims and invoices.
AdaptHealth contracts with several business process outsourcing providers to provide certain billing and administrative functions related to revenue cycle management. These providers are based in the Philippines, India and Central America and provide AdaptHealth with the ability to scale its workforce in a cost-effective manner. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 1,800 full-time equivalent personnel were provided to AdaptHealth under such arrangements. Following AdaptHealth’s acquisition of AeroCare in February 2021, an additional approximately 225 full-time equivalent personnel are provided to AdaptHealth under such arrangements. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales activities are generally carried out by AdaptHealth’s full-time sales representatives with assistance from on-site liaisons in certain markets who interact directly with hospital discharge coordinators and patients. AdaptHealth’s sales team works closely with AdaptHealth’s trained respiratory therapists in carrying out their daily sales activities. AdaptHealth primarily acquires new patients through referrals. Sources of referrals include acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist offices, skilled nursing facilities and hospice operators, among others. AdaptHealth’s sales representatives maintain continual contact with medical professionals across these facilities. AdaptHealth believes that its relationships with its referral sources are strong and that these entities will continue to be a source of organic growth 

10



through new patients. While AdaptHealth views its referral sources as fundamental to its business, no single referral source accounted for a material amount of its annual revenues as of December 31, 2020.
Acquisitions
Continuing to grow through accretive acquisitions is a key element of AdaptHealth’s growth strategy, and AdaptHealth continuously reviews its pipeline of potential acquisition candidates. AdaptHealth maintains a dedicated M&A integration team and leverages its scalable front-end and back-office technology platform to facilitate acquisition integration to help realize short-term cost saving synergies and longer term revenue growth synergies.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, AdaptHealth completed acquisitions involving 22 companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $914 million (excluding amounts related to contingent consideration). For the year ended December 31, 2019, AdaptHealth completed acquisitions involving 18 companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $67 million (excluding amounts related to contingent consideration).
Suppliers
AdaptHealth purchases home healthcare equipment, medical devices and supplies from a variety of suppliers. AdaptHealth’s sleep therapy equipment and supplies are primarily provided by two suppliers, its mobility and home services products (such as hospital beds, wheelchairs, walkers and commodes) are principally supplied by a single supplier and its diabetes services products/CGM products are primarily provided by two suppliers. Notwithstanding its significant supply relationships with these vendors, AdaptHealth believes that it is not dependent upon any single supplier and that its product needs can be met by an adequate number of qualified manufacturers.
Facilities
AdaptHealth does not own any properties and leases its headquarters facility located at 220 West Germantown Pike, Suite 250, Plymouth Meeting, PA. As of December 31, 2020, AdaptHealth serviced approximately 1.9 million patients annually across all 50 states and performed approximately 17,000 equipment and supply deliveries a day through its network of 283 locations in 42 states. Following the acquisition of AeroCare in February 2021, AdaptHealth services more than 3.0 million patients annually and performs approximately 29,000 deliveries a day through its network of over 500 locations across 46 states. Full-service locations are typically between 300 and 5,000 square feet and are usually a combination office and warehouse space. Many of these facilities are accredited to provide patient services, and their adjacent warehouse space is used for storage of adequate supplies of equipment and accessories for such patient services. AdaptHealth believes that these facilities are adequate to meet its current needs and expects to add additional facilities in connection with its growth strategies. AdaptHealth believes that such additional space, when required, will be available on commercially reasonable terms, consistent with historical cost trends.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, AdaptHealth had approximately 4,700 employees. Following AdaptHealth’s acquisition of AeroCare in February 2021, AdaptHealth has approximately 8,700 employees. AdaptHealth believes that relations between its management and employees are good.
Competition
The HME market is fragmented and highly competitive. AdaptHealth competes with other large national providers, including Apria Healthcare, Lincare and Rotech,; regional providers, including DASCO Home Medical Equipment, Binson’s Medical Equipment, Inc., Norco, Inc. Protech Home Medical Corp. and Spiro Health; and product-specific providers, including Breg, Inc., Byram Healthcare Centers, Inc., Inogen, Inc., Acelity L.P., CCS Medical, US Medical and Edgepark, as well as over 6,000 local organizations. In addition, non-HME providers, including CVS, Amazon and certain manufacturers of HME equipment are considering entering or expanding their presence in the HME market.

11



Consolidation of the HME market is a continuing trend, as required technology investments and reduced reimbursements put financial pressure on smaller providers. Larger HME providers with integrated technology and automated processes are generally better positioned to gain market share and more attractive vendor pricing. Competitive bidding also emphasizes the importance of relationships with both the payors and referral sources. Because payors typically select a limited number of exclusive suppliers and physicians typically refer based on timely delivery and consistency, relationships with both are critical to the success of competitors in the market.
AdaptHealth believes that the most important competitive factors in the regional and local markets are:

● | Reputation with referral sources, including local physicians and hospital-based professionals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Service quality and efficient, responsive referral process;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Differentiated technology platform that provides a superior physician and patient experience;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Comprehensive offering across the home medical equipment space;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad network of payor contracts and regional insurers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Overall ease of doing business; and
--+------------------------------------


● | Quality of patient care, including clinical expertise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

AdaptHealth believes that it competes favorably with competitors on the basis of these and other factors.
Legal Proceedings
AdaptHealth is involved in investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. These matters involve patient complaints, personnel and employment issues, regulatory matters, personal injury, contract and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although AdaptHealth does not expect the outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, such matters are inherently unpredictable. Therefore, AdaptHealth could incur judgments or enter into settlements or claims that could materially impact its financial condition or results of operations.
For example, on July 25, 2017, AdaptHealth Holdings was served with a subpoena by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (“EDPA”) pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3486 to produce certain audit records and internal communications regarding ventilator billing. The investigation appears to be focused on billing practices regarding one payor that contracted for bundled payments for certain ventilators. AdaptHealth Holdings has cooperated with investigators and, through agreement with the EDPA, has submitted all information requested. An independent third party was retained by AdaptHealth Holdings that identified overpayments and underpayments for ventilator billings related to the payor, and a remittance was sent to reconcile that account. AdaptHealth Holdings has cooperated and fully complied with the subpoena. On October 3, 2019 AdaptHealth received a follow-up civil investigative demand from the EDPA regarding a document previously produced to the EDPA and patients included in the review by the independent third party. AdaptHealth has responded to the EDPA and supplemented its production as requested. On November 9, 2020, the EDPA indicated to the Company that the investigation remained ongoing. The EDPA also requested additional information regarding certain patient services and claims refunds processed by AdaptHealth in 2017. The Company is compiling this information in coordination with the EDPA. While AdaptHealth cannot provide any assurance as to whether the EDPA will seek additional information or pursue this matter further, it does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Additionally, in March 2019, prior to its acquisition by AdaptHealth, AeroCare was served with a civil investigative demand (“CID”) issued by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky (“WDKY”).

The CID seeks to investigate allegations that AeroCare improperly billed, or caused others to improperly bill, for oxygen tank contents that were not delivered to beneficiaries. The WDKY has requested documents related to such oxygen tank content billing as well as other categories of information. AeroCare has cooperated with the WDKY and has produced documents and provided explanations of its billing practices. In September 2020, the WDKY indicated the investigation includes alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and as well as alleged violations of state Medicaid false claims acts in ten states. AeroCare has cooperated fully with the investigation and has indicated to the WDKY that concerns raised do not accurately identify Medicare coverage criteria and that state Medicaid coverage requirements generally do not provide for separate reimbursement for portable gaseous oxygen contents in the circumstances at issue. While AdaptHealth cannot provide any assurance as to whether the WDKY will seek additional information or pursue this matter further, it does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth.
Government Regulation
The federal government and all states in which AdaptHealth currently operates regulate various aspects of AdaptHealth’s business. In particular, AdaptHealth’s operations are subject to federal laws that regulate the reimbursement of its products and services under various government programs and that are designed to prevent fraud and abuse. AdaptHealth’s operations are also subject to state laws governing, among other things, pharmacies, nursing services, medical equipment suppliers and certain types of home health activities. State regulators may also determine that telephone marketing of AdaptHealth products and services to patients fall within state regulation of telemarketing. Certain of AdaptHealth’s employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the licensure and professional practice of respiratory therapy, pharmacy and nursing.
AdaptHealth maintains a Compliance Program that is designed to meet the guidelines set forth by HHS, and provides ongoing compliance training designed to keep AdaptHealth’s officers, directors and employees well-educated and up-to-date regarding developments on relevant topics and to emphasize AdaptHealth’s policy of strict compliance. Federal and state laws require that AdaptHealth obtain facility and other regulatory licenses and accreditation and that AdaptHealth enroll as a supplier with federal and state health programs.
As a healthcare provider, AdaptHealth is subject to extensive regulation to prevent fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs. The marketing, billing, documenting and other practices of healthcare companies are all subject to government scrutiny. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, regional health insurance carriers and state agencies often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support AdaptHealth’s claims submitted for payment of services rendered to customers. Similarly, government agencies and their contractors periodically open investigations and obtain information from healthcare providers pursuant to the legal process. Violations of federal and state regulations can result in severe criminal, civil and administrative penalties and sanctions, including disqualification from Medicare and other reimbursement programs, which could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth’s financial condition and results of operations.
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information or personal information. As part of AdaptHealth’s provision of, and billing for, healthcare equipment and services, AdaptHealth is required to collect and maintain patient-identifiable health information. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. For instance, the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for protected health information and the CCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, the CCPA may increase AdaptHealth’s compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant 

13



to HIPAA, the HITECH Act, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which AdaptHealth handles healthcare-related data and communicate with payers, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. If AdaptHealth does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, it could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.
Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require AdaptHealth to publish statements that describe how it handles personal information and choices individuals may have about the way AdaptHealth handles their personal information. If such information that AdaptHealth publishes is considered untrue, it may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Communications with our patients are also subject to laws and regulations governing communications, including the TCPA, the CAN-SPAM Act, additional fax regulations under the Junk Fax Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Medicare regulations.
Healthcare is an area of rapid regulatory change. Changes in the laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may affect permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business, and reimbursement amounts paid by federal, state and other third-party payers. AdaptHealth cannot predict the future of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or possible changes in national healthcare policies. Future legislative and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth’s financial condition and results of operations.
Implemented Regulation
As a provider of home oxygen, respiratory and other chronic therapy equipment to the home healthcare market, AdaptHealth participates in Medicare Part B, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Program, which was established by the Social Security Act of 1965. Providers of home oxygen and other respiratory therapy services and equipment have historically been heavily dependent on Medicare reimbursement due to the high proportion of elderly persons suffering from respiratory disease. Durable medical equipment, including oxygen equipment, is traditionally reimbursed by Medicare based on fixed fee schedules.
Impact of the ACA and MIPPA. The ACA, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (“MIPPA”), the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (“SCHIP Extension Act”), the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”) and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), contain provisions that directly impacted reimbursement for the primary respiratory and other DME products provided by AdaptHealth.
In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws intended to result in significant change to the ACA. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the former presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to the ACA, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the lower court’s finding that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, although it remains unclear when and how the Supreme Court will rule. These and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA could result in reduced funding state Medicaid programs, lower numbers of insured individuals, and reduced coverage for insured individuals. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and 

14



other healthcare industry participants. Government efforts to repeal or change the ACA or to implement alternative reform measures could cause AdaptHealth’s revenues to decrease to the extent such legislation reduces Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement rates.
MIPPA delayed the implementation of a Medicare competitive bidding program for oxygen equipment and certain other DME items that was scheduled to begin on July 1, 2008, and instituted a 9.5% price reduction nationwide for these items as of January 1, 2009. The SCHIP Extension Act reduced Medicare reimbursement amounts for covered Part B drugs, including inhalation drugs that AdaptHealth provides, beginning April 1, 2008. DRA provisions negatively impacted reimbursement for oxygen equipment beginning in 2006 through the implementation of a capped rental arrangement. MMA changed the pricing formulas used to establish payment rates for inhalation drug therapies resulting in significantly reduced reimbursement beginning in 2005, established a competitive acquisition program for DME, established a RAC program, which implemented a new method for recovery of Medicare overpayments by utilizing private companies operating on a contingent fee basis to identify and recoup Medicare overpayments, and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for DME suppliers. The RACs are empowered to audit claims submitted by healthcare providers and overpayments identified by the RACs can be recouped from future payments, including in cases where the reimbursement rules are unclear or subject to differing interpretations. This activity, as well as the activity of intermediaries and others involved in government reimbursement, may include changes in long-standing interpretations of reimbursement rules, which could adversely impact AdaptHealth’s future financial condition and results of operations. In October 2008, CMS established ZPICs and UPICs, who are responsible for ensuring the integrity of all Medicare-related claims. The ZPICs and UPICs assumed the responsibilities previously held by Medicare’s Program Safeguard Contractors. These legislative and regulatory provisions, as currently in effect have and will continue to adversely impact AdaptHealth’s financial condition and results of operations.
Impact of Competitive Bidding. In December 2003, MMA was signed into law. The MMA legislation directly impacted reimbursement for the primary respiratory and other DME products that AdaptHealth provides. Among other things, MMA established a competitive acquisition program for DME that was expected to commence in 2008, but was subsequently delayed by further legislation. MMA instructed CMS to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas would be established throughout the United States for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of DME, including oxygen equipment. The program was initially intended to be implemented in phases such that competition under the program would occur in nine of the largest metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) in the first year and an additional 70 of the largest MSAs in a second, subsequent round of bidding. The second round was subsequently expanded to include 91 MSAs.
For each competitive acquisition area, CMS is required to conduct a competition under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered items of DME. Successful bidders are expected to meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract, and only successful bidders can supply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the respective acquisition area (there are, however, regulations in place that allow non-contracted suppliers to continue to provide equipment and services to their existing customers at the new prices determined through the bidding process). Competitive bidding contracts are expected to be re-bid at least every three years. CMS is required to award contracts to multiple entities submitting bids in each area for an item or service but has the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive acquisition area to the number it determines to be necessary to meet projected demand. 
All Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program contracts expired on December 31, 2018, and, as a result, there is a temporary gap in the entire DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program that CMS stated would last until December 31, 2020 and be replaced by a single round of competition named “Round 2021” which consolidated the competitive bidding areas (“CBAs”) included in the Round 1 2017 and Round 2 Recompete DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Programs. Round 2021 contracts were scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2021, and extend through December 31, 2023. CMS included 16 product categories in Round 2021. On April 10, 2020, CMS announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it removed the non-invasive ventilators product category from the Round 2021 DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. 
On October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it would not award competitive bid contracts in 13 of the 15 remaining product categories due to a failure to achieve expected savings, and that contract awards would only be made for off-the-shelf (“OTS”) knee and back braces. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated with respect 

15



to providing OTS knee and back braces (excluding amounts generated in non-rural and rural non-bid areas) were not material. AdaptHealth expects to obtain contracts for OTS knee and back braces, and does not expect the single payment amounts imposed by CMS under such contracts to have a material impact on the Company.
The competitive bidding process (which is expected to be re-bid every three years) has historically put pressure on the amount AdaptHealth is reimbursed in the markets in which it exists, as well as in areas that are not subject to the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. The rates required to win future competitive bids could continue to depress reimbursement rates. AdaptHealth will continue to monitor developments regarding the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. While AdaptHealth cannot predict the outcome of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program on its business in the future nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, the program may materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.
CMS’s decision to cancel the 2021 competitive bidding program is a significant development for AdaptHealth. CMS is proposing to reimburse all HME other than off-the-shelf back and knee braces at current rates, to schedule the next round of competitive bidding in 2024, and to make the higher blended rates in rural territory permanent. In total, AdaptHealth believes these changes to the competitive bidding program are significantly positive to the business, and AdaptHealth expects the rate changes for the off-the-shelf back and knee braces to be immaterial to AdaptHealth. 
Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor. In order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary and appropriate items and services, the Medicare program has adopted a number of documentation requirements. For example, certain provisions under CMS guidance manuals, local coverage determinations, and the DME MAC Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the “patient’s medical record” is required to justify the initial and ongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and other government contractors have recently taken the position, among other things, that the “patient’s medical record” refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but instead to documentation maintained by the patient’s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information created by the DME supplier’s personnel and confirmed by the patient’s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. If treating physicians do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, the risks that AdaptHealth will be subject to audits and payment denials are likely to increase. Moreover, auditors’ interpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation, leading to significant increases in individual supplier and industry-wide perceived error rates. High error rates could lead to further audit activity and regulatory burdens and could result in AdaptHealth making significant refunds and other payments to Medicare and other government programs. Accordingly, AdaptHealth’s future revenues and cash flows from government healthcare programs may be reduced. Private payors also may conduct audits and may take legal action to recover alleged overpayments. AdaptHealth could be adversely affected in some of the markets in which it operates if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to AdaptHealth due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations. AdaptHealth cannot currently predict the adverse impact these measures might have on its financial condition and results of operations, but such impact could be material.
Federal and state budgetary and other cost-containment pressures will continue to impact the home respiratory care industry. AdaptHealth cannot predict whether new federal and state budgetary proposals will be adopted or the effect, if any, such proposals would have on its financial condition and results of operations.
