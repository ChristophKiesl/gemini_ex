      ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
     General 
        The Container Store® is the original and leading specialty retailer of storage and organization products and solutions in the United States and the only national retailer solely devoted to the category. We provide a collection of creative, multifunctional and customizable storage and organization solutions that are sold in our stores and online through a high-service, differentiated shopping experience. Our vision is to be a beloved brand and the first choice for personalized organization solutions and services. Our customers are predominantly female, highly educated and very busyfrom college students to empty nesters. We service them with storage and organization solutions that save them space and time and ultimately improve the quality of their lives. We believe an organized life is a happy life. 
         We were founded in 1978 in Dallas, Texas as The Container Store, Inc. In 2007, The Container Store, Inc. was sold to The Container Store Group, Inc. In November 2013, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the "IPO"). Our common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "TCS." In fiscal 2016, we generated net sales of $819.9 million. Today our operations consist of two operating segments:
 

The Container Store ("TCS"), which consists of our retail stores,
website and call center, as well as our installation and organizational services business. We operate 86 stores with an average size of approximately 25,000 square feet (19,000 selling square feet) in
31 states and the District of Columbia. Our stores present our products in a unique and engaging atmosphere. Our visual merchandising team works to ensure that all of our merchandise is appropriately
showcased to highlight the value and functionality of our products and maximize the appeal of our image and brand. We maintain a relatively consistent store layout which creates a familiar shopping
experience across our store base. Our stores are clean and spacious with strict, orderly merchandising and strategic product placements to optimize our selling space and increase productivity. We
allow our customers to shop with us in a variety of waysanywhere, anytime, any way she wants through a multi-channel shopping experience. Our stores receive substantially all of our
products directly from our distribution center co-located with our corporate headquarters and call center in Coppell, Texas. In fiscal 2016, TCS had net sales of $752.7 million, which
represented approximately 92% of our total net sales. 
Elfa, The Container Store, Inc.'s wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Elfa International AB
("Elfa"), which designs and manufactures component-based shelving and drawer systems and made-to-measure sliding doors. Elfa was founded in 1948 and is headquartered in Malmö, Sweden.
Elfa's shelving and drawer systems are customizable for any area of the home, including closets, kitchens, offices and garages. Elfa operates four manufacturing facilities with two located in Sweden,
one in Finland and one in Poland. The Container Store began selling elfa® products in 1978 and acquired Elfa in 1999. Today our TCS segment is the exclusive distributor of
elfa® products in the U.S. and represented approximately 42% of Elfa's total sales in fiscal 2016. Elfa also sells its products on a wholesale basis to various retailers in approximately
30 countries around the world, with a concentration in the Nordic region of Europe. In fiscal 2016, the Elfa segment had $67.3 million of third party net sales, which represented approximately
8% of our total net sales.

         On March 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from the Saturday closest to February 28 to the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. The fiscal year change became effective beginning with the Company's 2016 fiscal year, which began on April 3, 2016 and ended on April 1, 2017. As a result of the change, the Company had a March 2016 fiscal month transition period from February 28, 2016 to April 2, 2016. The unaudited results of the transition period were reported in the Company's Form 10-Q filed for the new fiscal first quarter ended July 2, 2016 and the audited results are presented herein. 
      Our Key Differentiators 
  Our Unique Product CollectionSolutions for Every Area of the Home:
        Our merchandising philosophy is to provide a carefully curated, one of a kind collection of storage and organization solutions for every area of the home, at a variety of price points. We offer more than 11,000 products designed to save space and time and each year, we introduce over 2,000 new SKUs into the assortment. Our solutions-based selling approach (versus items-based) is delivered by our highly trained salespeople. We believe selling solutions primarily consisting of exclusive, proprietary products that can't be found anywhere else differentiates us from other retailers. In fact, over half of our annual sales come from exclusive or proprietary products.

        In order to offer our unique collection of products and as a competitive merchandising and business strategy, we work to form meaningful, long-lasting relationships with vendors from around the world. We believe these relationships benefit us in a number of ways, including providing us with an increased number of exclusive products and competitive pricing. We believe that by creatively crafting mutually beneficial vendor relationships we foster a unique sense of loyalty among our more than 800 product vendors. Eighteen of our top 20 vendors have been with us for at least 10 years and several of those vendors have been with us since our inception in 1978. For the TCS segment, our top 10 vendors, excluding Elfa, accounted for 28% of our total purchases in fiscal 2016. In order to maximize our purchasing flexibility, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our vendors.

     Custom Closets:
        We continue to believe that our focus on Custom Closets, inclusive of elfa® product solutions, TCS Closets®, elfa® Sliding Doors, installation services and our closet completion products, provides a unique opportunity to drive comparable store sales through higher average ticket while differentiating the Company from online, items-based retailers. Our highly-trained and experienced sales force has been selling proprietary, custom-designed elfa® and other closet solutions for 38 years. We believe there is no other comparable retailer executing this holistic approach to custom closets. We offer the complete custom closet solutionnot just the framework of the closet, but the full array of closet organization products that accompany the closet, as well as a national footprint with millions of customers coming through the door and visiting our online site each year. We design and sell Custom Closets in-store, online, through our call center, as well as through our Contained Home® in-home organization service. 
         Our elfa® products continue to be an ever important, highly profitable and differentiating component in the growth of our company and our commitment to dominating the custom closet market, accounting for about 25% of our TCS retail sales. Due to our vertical integration of Elfa, we have control over the sourcing and availability of our best selling and highest margin product, elfa®. We are the exclusive distributor of elfa® products in the United States. Approximately 17% of our fiscal 2016 TCS segment purchases were attributed to intercompany purchases from our Elfa segment. 
         TCS Closets® average ticket has exceeded $10,000 since launching the product line. And while the initial focus for TCS Closets® has been the closet, based on customer demand and current trends, we plan to expand our offering of TCS Closets® solutions to other areas of the home. 
         To incentivize Custom Closet purchases, we launched our Customer Financing Program with Synchrony Financial. The program's early results show that for elfa® purchases over $500, financed elfa® purchases have a much higher average ticket than non-financed elfa® purchases. In addition to customers financing elfa® purchases, they are also using the TCS Credit Card to purchase TCS Closets® and other products. 
   Our Shopping Experience:
        We strive to create an Air of Excitement in each of our stores across the country. We say, "three steps in the door and you can tell whether or not a store has it." You can experience the Air of Excitement through our employees' smiling faces and their genuine interest in a customer's needs; in the bright visual displays of products and solutions; our clean, well-organized store; and in our energetic product demonstrations and upbeat music. 
         This is coupled with our highly personalized approach to customer service. When a customer comes into our store looking for a shoe rack, we ask questions to understand all of her needs. We believe that if we fail to discover her underlying storage and organization challenges, we fail to truly help her and make her happy. Service and selling are the same thing at The Container Store. We believe we can best serve the customer by astonishing her and giving her the solution she truly needs and benefit the Company at the same time. 
         We are a multi-channel retailer, with a fully-integrated website, responsive mobile site, and call center to complement our physical stores. Our website, containerstore.com, is intended to replicate the store experience offering the same product assortment and real time inventory information for our stores, as well as certain products found exclusively online. We enhance the customer's experience and deepen loyalty by creating consistent, relevant messages, regardless of which channel is being usedwe are channel agnostic. We offer free shipping on orders over $75 and our customers are able to purchase online and pick up at a store, with curbside pick-up in most markets, or request same-day 
 8

   home delivery in select markets. The website, mobile site, and call center sales channels accounted for an aggregate of approximately 15% of TCS net sales in fiscal 2016. 
   Our Stores:
        We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and nationally recognized brand name to successfully develop new stores in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new, existing, small and large markets. Our current footprint of 86 stores extends to 31 states and the District of Columbia. We opened a total of seven new stores in the 2016 fiscal year and we expect to open a total of five new stores (including one relocation) in the 2017 fiscal year. While our current expansion focus is on domestic markets, we believe international expansion may provide additional growth opportunities for us in the future. 
         We have a strong base of profitable stores and believe that our expansion opportunities in the United States are significant. We plan to continue to seek out strategic and profitable real estate expansion via a variety of store formats and sizes. In fiscal 2017, we plan to test a reduced-sized footprint in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and do a complete re-design of our flagship store in Dallas, which we believe will provide us insight to develop new store formats and evolve the future of our existing stores' experience. Our store opening strategy involves a strategic formula of training, marketing, non-profit partnerships and public relations, which enables our new stores to deliver strong sales volume more quickly. 
      What We Stand ForOrganization with Heart® 
        The Container Store has been getting people organized for more than 38 years, and since 1978, we've also been running our business guided by our values-based set of principles. Back then, we just called it doing business. Today, we're proud to be one of the founding companies in a movement called Conscious Capitalism®, which includes a group of like-minded businesses, thought leaders, authors and academics all working together to change the way business is done in America and around the world. Businesses that practice Conscious Capitalism have leaders who "walk the talk" by developing and nurturing a conscious culture. We have a firm belief that creating value for and optimizing relationships between all of the stakeholders of our businessemployees, customers, vendors, community and shareholdersis the right thing to do. 
         Consistent with our commitment to Conscious Capitalism, we believe that happy employees lead directly to better performance and higher profits. We believe in putting employees first and staying true to our seven Foundation Principles®simple business philosophies that guide each decision we make. One of those Foundation Principles is 1 Great Person = 3 Good People® in terms of business productivitythat's our hiring philosophy. In fact, in fiscal 2016, we hired only 8% of job applicants. Our employee-first culture includes a tremendous commitment to communication, training and career development that helps deliver a differentiated experience to our customers, which we believe results in a higher average ticket, repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential customers. In fact, full-time store employees receive up to 260 hours of formal training in their first year alonesignificantly higher than industry average. Our stores offer flexible work schedules, comprehensive benefits and above retail industry average compensation to both full-time and part-time employees. As a result, TCS has an average full-time employee turnover rate of approximately 13% annually, significantly below the retail average. It's for these reasons and more that The Container Store has been named by FORTUNE Magazine to its annual list of 100 Best Companies to Work For® 18 years in a row. 
         As of April 1, 2017, we had approximately 5,100 employees, of which approximately 4,500 were TCS employees and approximately 600 were Elfa employees. Of the 4,500 TCS employees, approximately 2,900 were part-time employees.

      Distribution 
        In the TCS segment, substantially all of our merchandise flows through a centralized distribution center prior to transport to our retail stores. Our distribution center is co-located with our corporate offices in Coppell, Texas. The approximately 1.1 million square foot facility was designed and constructed specifically for The Container Store and is comprised of approximately 93,000 square feet of corporate office space and approximately 1 million square feet of warehouse space. 
         Our Coppell, Texas distribution center is utilized for retail store replenishment and direct-to-customer orders. With the exception of the Dallas / Fort Worth market, we utilize third party truckload carriers to transport all of our products to our stores. We utilize best in class logistics technology to optimize operations and current processes for picking, packing and shipping while providing a strong foundation for future growth. We believe our enhanced distribution and supply chain operations allow us to distribute merchandise to our stores and customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner, improving our customer's overall buying experience. We continue to strengthen our distribution center with ongoing process and material handling improvements in order to achieve even greater efficiencies in service levels and the management of our inventory. This includes automation improvements to enhance our store fulfillment and customer delivery logistics performance. 
         Within our distribution operations, we have a culture of safety and efficiency, with a robust metric program and a commitment to continuous improvement. All processes, teams and individuals are held to high efficiency and performance standards. We believe that the size and scalability of the distribution center is sufficient to support our future expansion over the next 2 to 3 years. We are currently considering the need for a second distribution center along with supply chain system enhancements in the mid- to long-term for increased logistics network support. 
         Elfa utilizes a broad network of third-party carriers to deliver products from its manufacturing facilities to customers worldwide. 
      Intellectual property 
        Our "The Container Store," "Contain Yourself", "Foundation Principles", "POP! Perfectly Organized Perks", "TCS Closets", "Contained Home", and "elfa" trademarks and certain variations thereon, such as our "The Container Store" logo and many trademarks used for our product lines and sales campaigns are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own many domain names, including "www.containerstore.com," "www.whatwestandfor.com" and others that include our trademarks. We also own a patent for our proprietary retail shopping computer systems and copyrights in our catalogs, websites, and other marketing material. We believe that our trademarks, product designs and copyrighted works have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement. 
      Competition 
        We operate within the storage and organization category which extends across many retail segments including housewares, office supplies and travel, among others. However, we are the only national retailer solely devoted to it. Storage and organization products are sold by a variety of retailers, including mass merchants, specialty retail chains, and internet-based retailers, but they devote a smaller portion of their merchandise assortment to storage and organization. Some of these retailers are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than The Container Store. We 
 10

   compete with such retailers based on our customer service, product selection and quality, price, convenience, effective consumer marketing and promotional activities, the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences, vendor relationships, and brand recognition, among other things. We believe that the strength of our solutions-based selling with highly trained employees, exclusive offerings and vendor relationships, our passionate and loyal customer base and the quality, differentiation and breadth of product assortment compare favorably to those of our competitors. 
      Seasonality 
        Our storage and organization product offering makes us less susceptible to holiday season shopping patterns than many retailers. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of net sales, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter, attributable primarily to the impact of Our Annual elfa® Sale, which traditionally starts on or about December 24th and runs into February. As such, our business has historically realized greater leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses during our fiscal fourth quarter. In fact, over half of our adjusted net income was derived in the fiscal fourth quarter in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014. For more information regarding our use of adjusted net income, and a reconciliation of adjusted net income to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) available to common shareholders, see "Item 6: Selected Financial and Operating Data." 
      Regulation and legislation 
        We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 
         We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.
