ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 NextGen Healthcare is a leading provider of software and services that empower ambulatory healthcare practices to manage the risk and complexity of delivering care in the rapidly evolving U.S. healthcare system. Our combination of technological breadth, depth and domain expertise makes us a preferred solution provider and trusted advisor for our clients. In addition to highly configurable core clinical and financial capabilities, our portfolio includes tightly integrated solutions that deliver on ambulatory healthcare imperatives including: population health, care management, patient outreach, telemedicine and nationwide clinical information exchange. 
 We serve clients across all 50 states. Our approximately 100,000 providers deliver care in nearly every medical specialty in a wide variety of practice models including accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), independent physician associations (“IPAs”), managed service organizations (“MSOs”), Veterans Service Organizations (“VSOs”), and Dental Service Organizations (“DSOs”). Our clients include some of the largest and most progressive multi-specialty groups in the country. With the recent addition of behavioral health to our strong medical and oral health capabilities, we continue to extend our share not only in Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”), but also in the emerging integrated care market. 
 NextGen Healthcare has historically enhanced our offering through both organic and inorganic activities. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. and its cloud-based electronic health record and practice management solution. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. and its cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. and its cloud-based population health analytics solution. In January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies for its specialty-focused clinical content. In October 2019, we acquired Topaz Information Systems, LLC for its behavioral health solutions. In December 2019, we acquired Medfusion, Inc. for its Patient Experience Platform (i.e., patient portal, self-scheduling, and patient pay) capabilities and OTTO Health, LLC for its integrated virtual care solutions, notably telemedicine. The integration of these acquired technologies has made NextGen Healthcare’s solutions among the most comprehensive and powerful in the market. 
 Our company was incorporated in California in 1974. Previously named Quality Systems, Inc., we changed our corporate name to NextGen Healthcare, Inc. in September 2018. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612, and our principal website is www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.
 Industry Background, Regulatory Environment, and Market Opportunity 
 Over the last decade, the ambulatory healthcare market has experienced significant regulatory change, which has driven the need for improved technology to enable practice transformation. Recognizing it was imperative to digitize the American health system to stem the escalating cost of healthcare and improve the quality of care being delivered, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009 (“HITECH Act”). The legislation stimulated healthcare organizations to not only adopt electronic health records, but to use them to collect discrete data that could be used to drive quality care. This standardization supported early pay-for-reporting and pay-for-performance programs. 
 In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) established the roadmap for shifting American healthcare from volume (fee-for-service) to a value-based care (“VBC”) system that rewards improved outcomes at lower costs (fee-for-value). This was followed by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), bipartisan legislation that further changed the way Medicare rewards clinicians for value vs. volume. Initially focused on government-funded care, the domain of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), these programs are now firmly established on the commercial insurance side of the industry as well.
 VBC created the need for a new category of healthcare information technology (“HIT”) tools that could be used to identify and treat groups of patients, or cohorts, based on risk. Population Health Management (“PHM”) tools support these needs by identifying patient risk, engaging patients, coordinating care, and determining when interventions are needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. According to estimates from Frost & Sullivan in May 2020, the United States PHM market is expected to reach $9.4 billion in total revenue by 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 28% from 2017.
 Importantly, the introduction of VBC programs was only an element of the broader approach to reducing healthcare expenditure. It was also accompanied by significant reductions in Medicare spending with a projected reduction of $253 billion in payments by 2029, as reported by RevCycle Intelligence in October 2019. The drive to reduce costs initially led to consolidation in the healthcare system that was followed by a significant shift of care from the inpatient to lower cost outpatient setting. Ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) have become an essential component of comprehensive, low cost distributed care. According to an October 2019 report from ResearchandMarkets, ASCs continue to perform more than half of all U.S. outpatient surgical procedures and are expected to see greater volumes as the number of outpatient procedures increases by an estimated 15% by 2028. From 2015 to 2022, the proportion of outpatient cases performed in ASCs is expected to increase across most service lines with the largest jump (10%) to occur in spine procedures. Among other factors, consumerism is set to play a major role in driving ASC volume increases, as procedures performed in ASCs cost an average of 58% less than the

same procedure in a hospital outpatient department. The need to sustain revenue has made it extremely important for practices to secure their patient market share, elevating patient loyalty to a significant determinant of provider success. In addition to being loyal, groups participating in value-based contracts realized that patients also needed to be engaged in their care and interested in improving their own health. The need to attract, retain and engage patients has made patient experience one of the most important aspects of evolving care delivery in the United States. Capturing patient market share and thriving in a market driven by VBC requires both an integrated platform and a full view of the patient population’s clinical and cost data, neither of which could be accomplished without new technologies to collect and analyze multi-sourced patient data. Effectively implemented, these new technologies allow organizations to enhance financial viability while exercising the freedom to join, affiliate, integrate or interoperate in ways that maximize strategic control.
 Although the HITECH Act led to the successful adoption of electronic health records, many in the healthcare industry were dissatisfied with the level of exchange of health information between different providers and across different software platforms. With the passing of the MACRA law in 2015, the U.S. Congress declared it a national objective to achieve widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology. Then, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was passed and signed into law. Among many other policies, the law includes numerous provisions intended to encourage nationwide interoperability. 
 In March 2020, the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) released a final regulation which implements the key interoperability provisions included in the Cures Act. The rule calls on developers of certified EHRs to adopt standardized application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and to meet a list of other new certification and maintenance of certification requirements in order to maintain approved federal government certification status.
 The ONC rule also implements the information blocking provisions of the Cures Act, including identifying reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. Under the Cures Act, HHS has the regulatory authority to investigate and assess civil monetary penalties of up to $1,000,000 against certified health IT developers found to be in violation of “information blocking.”
 The new regulations will require significant compliance efforts for healthcare providers, information networks, exchanges, and HIT companies. However, CURES also creates opportunities for improving care delivery and outcomes through increased data exchange between providers, and easier patient access to their own health information. Key to unlocking these benefits is the introduction of new Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (“FHIR”) standards. ONC’s goal is for certified HIT companies to adopt FHIR-based API standards. Meanwhile, CMS is requiring hospitals to provide electronic admission, discharge and transfer notification to other healthcare facilities, providers and designated care team members.
 Through the expansion of our NextGen® Share interoperability services platform and API partner marketplace, we will address the increased demand for moving and sharing patient data from the EHR easily, quickly and securely. Interoperability improves patient experience and care coordination, enhances patient safety, and reduces costs. We are also expanding resources such as educational webinars, blogs and videos on interoperability to help educate and support healthcare providers.
 In recent years, there has been incremental investment to improve the delivery of behavioral healthcare. One of the central drivers of this investment has been the opioid epidemic which claims more than 70,000 lives a year in the United States. The integrated care model previously prevalent mainly in FQHCs, a model which calls for integration of behavioral health and primary care in single care settings, has also gained momentum. Both behavioral health and the integrated care workflows require broad, purpose built, tailored HIT capabilities, many of which are supported by the NextGen platform.
 In late 2019, the emergence of a novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”), declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In March 2020, the WHO escalated COVID-19 as a pandemic. According to Johns Hopkins University, as of May 29, 2020, more than 5.9 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 188 countries with more than 364,000 deaths. In addition to the socioeconomic disruption caused by the pandemic, both treatment and suppression measures stressed the very fabric of the U.S. healthcare system in some geographies, exacerbating some of the existing challenges with capacity, balance and reimbursement. Among the measures to slow the spread of the disease and flatten the curve in line with healthcare system capacity was social/physical distancing. The need to access care while still social distancing was addressed early on with the limited use of virtual visits and was energized when the federal government reduced regulatory barriers and addressed payment parity between virtual and in-person visits. With these tailwinds, telemedicine quickly became regarded as a safer way for patients and providers to engage each other while also relieving economic pressure on the medical practice. We believe that the uptake of telemedicine will transcend COVID-19 and that virtual visits will become a permanent and important change in the way care is delivered. Keeping patients out of the transit system, out of the waiting room and away from other sick patients is simply good medicine. 
 We also believe that ambulatory practices will emerge from the pandemic with a clearer appreciation of the importance of business continuity and will turn to NextGen more often for managed services. Consequently, we expect to see increased subscription of our revenue cycle management services, managed hosting, and our emerging capabilities for managed clinical and administrative services.

Based on these trends, successful clients must undertake the following imperatives: 
  
1. | Manage patient experience and engagement
---+-----------------------------------------


2. | Align incentives and energize clinicians
---+-----------------------------------------


3. | Maximize and shape financial outcomes
---+--------------------------------------


4. | Assume risk and drive commercial advantage
---+-------------------------------------------


5. | Optimize workflows with data exchange
---+--------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 We empower the accelerating transformation of ambulatory care by delivering solutions that enable groups to be successful under all models of care, including emerging value-based care in which providers assume risk while minimizing risk. We primarily serve groups that focus on delivering care in ambulatory settings, and do so across diverse practice sizes, specialties, and business constructs. In addition to traditional medical specialties, we participate actively with groups that deliver oral (dental) and behavioral healthcare, and with those that combine these in the emerging model for integrated care. 
 Our configurability enables groups to drive commercial advantage with creative workflows for patient access, patient-provider interactions, clinical workflows and care coordination. At the same time, our automation helps drive variability and cost out of the back office by accommodating exacting regulatory, billing and reporting requirements. We embrace both the art and science of delivering healthcare in the transforming U.S. healthcare system.
 We believe that the ability to interoperate in a complex, heterogeneous healthcare ecosystem is one of the keys to providing great care and healthy financial outcomes. Because we interoperate with the major stakeholders across the U.S. healthcare system and power many of the nation’s Health Information Exchanges (“HIEs”), we help keep patient data more secure, promote continuity of care, lower the cost of care delivery and perhaps most importantly improve the patient experience. 
 We recognize that patient experience drives patient engagement and that engaged patients have better outcomes. Consequently, much of our activity over the last few years has been informed by the emergence of the patient as an active, involved consumer. Our solutions help our clients create a holistic, personalized care experience that drive loyalty and satisfaction. 
 We surround our technical solutions with implementation and optimization services and provide business process outsourcing with managed hosting and revenue cycle management services. With some of our most sophisticated clients, we have been asked to share the breadth of our experience as they shape their strategies. We believe that this sort of engagement, acting as a virtual extension of our clients’ leadership teams, is an important step along our journey to becoming a trusted advisor. 
 As one of the leading healthcare information technology players in the U.S. ambulatory marketplace, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients through the market’s transformation. We expect to continue to empower the transformation of care through the following strategic priorities: 
  
• | Be a learning organization and transform ahead of the industry
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Be a trusted advisor for our customers and prospects
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Deliver breadth, depth and configurability to enable our clients to effectively execute their strategies
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use automation to drive variability and cost from our clients’ operations
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive real innovation in patient experience and patient-provider interactions
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Help our clients be recognized as interoperability leaders in their regions and areas of specialty
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrate new capabilities (whether organic or inorganic) more quickly and successfully than others.

Connected Health Solutions enable better care by ensuring the patient and provider are making decisions based on the patient’s full medical record. Interoperability is the ability of different information technology systems to communicate and exchange usable data. In healthcare, it enables caregivers to more effectively work together within and across organizational boundaries, and informed patients to be better equipped to collaborate on their own care. To provide the highest quality care at the lowest cost, organizations must capture and share information both within and across organizational boundaries outside their networks. In addition, interoperability must be frictionless and easy to implement or the opportunity to inform patient care will be missed. Our integrated, interoperable solutions and services enable providers to leverage their current technology for better outcomes and truly connected patient care.

 We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. To protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant. In addition, we include intellectual property protective provisions in our client contracts. However, because the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we believe such factors as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of our technology.
 We rely on software that we license from third parties for certain components of our products and services. These components enhance our products and services and help meet evolving client needs. The failure to license any necessary technology, or to maintain our existing licenses, could result in reduced functionality of or reduced demand for our products.
 Although we believe our products and services, and other proprietary rights, do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claims may result in costly, time-consuming litigation and may require us to enter into royalty or cross-license arrangements.

Competition
 The markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Our traditional full-suite competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., athenahealth, Inc., Cerner Corporation, eClinicalWorks, Epic Systems Corporation, and Greenway Health, LLC. Emerging smaller competitors also bring competition in specific sectors of the market. Additionally, we face competition from services-only competitors like business process outsourcers, hosting providers and transcription companies. 
 The EHR, PM, interoperability, and connectivity markets, in particular, are subject to rapid changes in technology. We expect that competition in these market segments could increase as new competitors enter the market. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our ambulatory-only focus, our comprehensive and fully-integrated solution, and our deep domain expertise, which enables our subject matter experts to serve as trusted advisors to our clients.
 Privacy and Security
 Our business operations involve hosting, storing, processing and transmitting confidential information including patient health information and payment card information. In addition to single-tenant environments, we operate unified, multi-tenant platforms that offer reliability, scalability, performance, security and privacy for our clients. Our infrastructure resides in several geographically diverse regions across the United States. We maintain a comprehensive security program designed to help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our clients’ data, which includes both organizational and technical control measures and the security and privacy of our service offerings. We also have systems in place to monitor the safety of patient information as well as procedures designed to take immediate action.
 We have the industry’s most well-known certifications for payment card and healthcare data. Including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Level 1 Service Provider, Security Organization Control 2, or SOC 2 Type II, DirectTrust Health Information Service Provider (HISP), and HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). These certifications give our clients third-party assurance we are meeting or exceeding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. As a PCI-DSS Level 1 Service Provider, we are committed to upholding industry security standards to cardholder data. The Level 1 PCI compliance allows us to minimize clients’ PCI scope.
 While we have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to help protect our systems, in the event of a system interruption, security incident, or breach, these safeguards may not prevent future cybersecurity incidents or breaches. We have a comprehensive and documented Information Security Management Program designed to secure the data within our infrastructure and provide appropriate reporting disclosure, and response. In addition, all of our associates are required to complete annual cybersecurity training, HIPAA training, and PCI DSS training. These training modules are reviewed annually to ensure compliance with the latest regulatory guidelines, laws, and industry best practices.
 Managing Cybersecurity Risks
 Our business operations involve hosting, storing, processing and transmitting confidential information including patient health information.

Sales and Marketing 
 We sell and market our products primarily through a direct sales force and to a significantly lesser extent, through a reseller channel. NextGen Healthcare also provides solutions to networks of practices such as MSOs, IPAs, ACOs, ambulatory care centers (“ACCs”), and community health centers (“CHCs”). Our direct sales force is comprised of sales executives and account executives, who seek to understand the client strategy and identify the opportunities in their practice and build both a multistage roadmap to reach the desired end state. For large clients, we use both inside and outside sales where efforts are a mix of on-site as well as web based. For smaller clients, efforts are all inside sales via web and phone, all of whom deliver presentations to potential clients by demonstrating our systems and capabilities either on prospective client’s premises or through video meeting and web-based presentations. System demonstrations for mobile workflow and analytics solutions are more web-based as these offerings tend to be targeted to larger practices. Both the direct and reseller channel salesforces concentrate on multi-product/solution sales opportunities. Our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means, including: a healthcare data and analytics platform, search engine optimization and value exchange content on nextgen.com; digital advertising; direct mail and email campaigns; referrals from existing clients and industry consultants; contacts at professional society meetings and trade shows; webinars; public relations and social media campaigns; and telemarketing. Resources have shifted more heavily to digital marketing as we meet potential clients where they are and how they shop for services. Additionally, we focus on thought leadership and content marketing to highlight our industry knowledge, expertise and the successes of our diverse client base. On the larger end of the range, our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to 18 months from initial contact to contract execution. Smaller practices on NextGen Office tend to have significantly shorter sales cycles ranging in weeks. Historically, software licenses are normally delivered to a client almost immediately upon receipt of an order and we normally receive up-front licensing fees. Implementation and training services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable. Moving forward, we expect more of our transactions to move to subscriptions. Clients have the option to purchase hosting and maintenance services which, are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Subscriptions are delivered electronically after the agreement is signed. They generally include implementation and are typically billed monthly after implementation or based on volume or throughput. We continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on the ambulatory market from large multi-specialty organizations to small-single specialty practices in high-opportunity specialty segments. 
 We have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us. No client accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during each of the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. In addition, software license sales to resellers represented less than 10% of total revenue for each of the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Substantially all of our clients are located in the United States.
 Employees
 As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,754 full-time employees, of which 758 were based in Bangalore, India and substantially all other employees were based in the United States. We believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales, marketing and technical talent as well as other employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
