Our industrial services are generally provided directly to refineries and petrochemical plants. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 33,000 employees. 
Our revenues are derived from many different customers in numerous industries, which have operations in several different geographical areas. Of our 2020 revenues, approximately 95% were generated in the United States and approximately 5% were generated in foreign countries, substantially all in the United Kingdom. In 2020, approximately 62% of revenues were derived from our construction operations, approximately 29% of revenues were derived from our building services operations and approximately 9% of revenues were derived from our industrial services operations. 
During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented as discontinued operations.
The broad scope of our operations is more particularly described below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income and total assets of each of our segments with respect to each of the last three years, and our revenues and assets attributable to the United States and the United Kingdom for the last three years, see Note 19 - Segment Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Operations 
The electrical and mechanical construction services industry has experienced growth due principally to the increased content, complexity, and sophistication of electrical and mechanical systems resulting, in part, from growth in digital processing, and cloud computing and data storage. In addition, facilities of all types require extensive electrical distribution systems, sophisticated power supplies, networks of low-voltage and fiber-optic communications cabling, and various mechanical, plumbing, and fire protection and suppression systems. Moreover, the need for substantial environmental controls within a building, due to the heightened need to maintain extensive computer systems at optimal temperatures, and the demand for increased energy efficiency, have over the years expanded opportunities for our electrical and mechanical services businesses. The demand for these services is typically driven by non-residential construction and renovation activity. 
Our electrical and mechanical construction services primarily involve the design, integration, installation, and start-up of, and provision of services relating to: (a) electrical power transmission and distribution systems, including power cables, conduits, distribution panels, transformers, generators, uninterruptible power supply systems, and related switch gear and controls; (b) premises electrical and lighting systems, including fixtures and controls; (c) process instrumentation in the refining, chemical processing, food processing, and mining industries; (d) low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security, and process control systems; (e) voice and data communications systems, including fiber-optic and low-voltage cabling, distributed antenna systems, and audiovisual systems; (f) roadway and transit lighting and signaling; and (g) fiber-optic lines; (h) heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, and clean-room process ventilation systems; (i) fire protection systems; (j) plumbing, process, and high-purity piping systems; (k) controls and filtration systems; (l) water and wastewater treatment systems; (m) central plant heating and cooling systems; (n) cranes and rigging; (o) millwrighting; and (p) steel fabrication, erection, and welding. 
Our electrical and mechanical construction services generally fall into one of three categories: (a) large installation projects, with contracts often in the multi-million dollar range, that involve: (i) the construction of manufacturing facilities, data centers, and commercial buildings, (ii) institutional and public works projects, or (iii) the fit-out of large blocks of space within commercial buildings, (b) large and medium sized capital and maintenance projects for commercial, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, healthcare, oil and gas, industrial, and petrochemical clients and (c) smaller installation projects, of a short duration, typically involving fit-out, renovation, and retrofit work. We also install and maintain lighting for streets, highways, bridges and tunnels, traffic signals, computerized traffic control systems, and signal and communication systems for mass transit systems, in several metropolitan areas. In addition, we manufacture and install sheet metal air handling systems for both our own mechanical construction operations and for unrelated mechanical contractors. We also maintain welding and pipe fabrication shops in support of some of our mechanical operations. 
Our United States electrical and mechanical construction operations accounted for about 62% of our 2020 total revenues. Of such revenues, approximately 36% were generated by our electrical construction operations and approximately 64% were generated by our mechanical construction operations. 
We provide electrical and mechanical construction services for both large and small installation and renovation projects. Our largest projects have included those: (a) for commercial purposes (such as office buildings, data centers, convention centers, sports stadiums, and shopping malls); (b) for manufacturing and industrial purposes (such as pharmaceutical plants, steel, pulp and paper mills, food processing, automotive and semiconductor manufacturing facilities, power generation (including sustainable energy solutions such as solar and wind), oil and gas refineries, and chemical processing plants); (c) for transportation purposes (such as highways, bridges, airports, and transit systems); (d) for institutional purposes (such as educational and correctional facilities and research laboratories); (e) for healthcare purposes; (f) for water and wastewater purposes; and (g) for hospitality purposes (such as resorts, hotels, and gaming facilities). Our largest projects, which typically range in size from $10 million up to and occasionally exceeding $200 million, represented approximately 35% of our electrical and mechanical construction services revenues in 2020. Depending on the size and complexity of these projects, they may span multiple years and typically require significant technical and management skills and the financial strength to obtain performance bonds, which are often a condition to bidding for and winning these projects.
Our projects of less than $10 million accounted for approximately 65% of our electrical and mechanical construction services revenues in 2020. These projects are typically completed in less than one year. They usually involve electrical and mechanical construction services when an end-user or owner undertakes construction or modification of a facility to accommodate a specific use, replace aging systems, or increase energy efficiency. These projects frequently require electrical and mechanical systems to meet special needs such as critical systems power supply, fire protection systems, special environmental controls and high-purity air systems, sophisticated electrical and mechanical systems for data centers, new production lines in manufacturing plants, and office arrangements in existing office buildings. They are not usually dependent upon the new construction market. Demand for these projects and types of services is often prompted by the expiration of leases, changes in technology, the demand for more energy efficient systems, or changes in the customer’s plant or office layout in the normal course of a customer’s business. 
We have a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships. We perform construction services pursuant to contracts with owners (such as corporations, municipalities, and other governmental entities), general contractors, systems suppliers, construction managers, developers, other subcontractors, and tenants of commercial properties. 
In addition to our electrical and mechanical construction services, we provide a number of building services throughout the United States and United Kingdom. Our building services operations have built upon our traditional electrical and mechanical construction operations and our client relationships to expand the scope of services being offered and to develop packages of services for customers on a regional and national basis.
Our building services operations provide a broad range of services, including mobile mechanical maintenance and services for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and building automation systems; commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; indoor air quality improvement services; facility management, maintenance, and services, including outage services to utilities and manufacturing facilities; military base operations support services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; other building services, including reception, security, and catering services; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development, management, and maintenance with respect to energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state, and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects. 
Our building services operations, which generated approximately 29% of our 2020 total revenues, provide services to owners, operators, tenants, and managers of all types of facilities both on a contractual basis for a specified period of time and on an individual task order basis. Of our building services revenues for 2020, approximately 83% were generated in the United States and approximately 17% were generated in the United Kingdom. 
 Demand for our building services is often driven by customers’ decisions to focus on their core competencies, customers’ programs to reduce costs, the increasing technical complexity of their facilities and their mechanical, electrical, building automation, voice and data, and other systems, and the need for increased reliability, energy efficiency, and air filtration and sanitization. These trends have led to outsourcing and privatization programs whereby customers in both the private and public sectors seek to contract out those activities that support, but are not directly associated with, the customer’s core business. Clients of our building services business include federal and state governments, institutional organizations, utilities, independent power producers, healthcare providers, and major corporations engaged in information technology, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and manufacturing, as well as large retailers and other businesses with geographically dispersed locations throughout the United States.
We provide building services at a number of prominent buildings, including those that house the Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the General Accountability Office, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other government facilities, including the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We also provide building services, as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, to a number of military bases, including base operations support services to the Army’s Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, and are involved in a joint venture providing building services to NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center. The agreements pursuant to which this division provides services to the federal government are frequently for a base period and a number of option years exercisable at the sole discretion of the government, are often subject to renegotiation by the government in terms of scope of services, and are subject to termination by the government prior to the expiration of the applicable term. 
Our industrial services business, which generated approximately 9% of our 2020 total revenues, is a recognized leader in the refinery turnaround market and has a presence in the petrochemical market. Our industrial services operations perform turnaround and maintenance services for critical units of refineries and petrochemical plants to upgrade, repair, and maintain them. Such services include: (a) engineering and planning services in advance of complex refinery turnarounds; (b) overhaul and maintenance of critical process units (including hydrofluoric alkylation units, fluid catalytic cracking units, coking units, heaters, heat exchangers, and related mechanical equipment) during refinery and petrochemical plant shut downs; (c) replacement and new construction capital projects for refineries and petrochemical plants; and (d) other related specialty services such as (i) welding (including pipe welding) and fabrication; (ii) heater, boiler, and reformer repairs and replacements; converter repair and revamps; and vessel, exchanger and tower services; (iii) tower and column repairs in refineries and petrochemical plants; (iv) installation and repair of refractory materials for critical units in process plants to protect equipment from corrosion, erosion, and extreme temperatures; and (v) acid-proofing services to protect critical components at refineries from chemical exposure. In addition, these businesses design and manufacture highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers and provide maintenance, repair, and cleaning services for heat exchangers both in the field and at our own shops, including tube and shell repairs, bundle repairs, and extraction services. Demand for these services is highly dependent on the strength of the oil and gas and related industrial markets.
Competition 
Across our operations, we compete with national, regional, and local companies, many of which are small, owner-operated entities that carry on their businesses in a limited geographic area, as well as with certain foreign companies. 
The electrical and mechanical construction services industry is highly fragmented and our competition includes thousands of small companies across the United States. In addition, there are a few larger public companies focused on providing either electrical and/or mechanical construction services, such as IES Holdings, Inc., Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and Tutor Perini Corporation. A majority of our revenues are derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, technical capability, and financial strength. Competitive factors in the electrical and mechanical construction services business include: (a) the availability of qualified and/or licensed personnel; (b) reputation for integrity and quality; (c) safety record; (d) cost structure and the ability to control project costs; (e) relationships with customers; (f) price; (g) geographic diversity; (h) experience in specialized markets; (i) the ability to obtain surety bonding; and (j) adequate working capital or access to bank credit. We believe our financial position, operating results, access to bank credit and surety bonding, technical expertise, and safety record, among other factors, give us a significant competitive advantage. However, relatively few barriers exist to prevent entry into the electrical and mechanical construction services industry. 
While the building services industry is also highly fragmented, with most competitors operating in a specific geographic region, a number of large U.S. based corporations such as Amentum Services, Inc., Johnson Controls International plc., Fluor Corporation, J&J Worldwide Services, Cushman & Wakefield plc, CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Sodexo, Inc., Aramark Corporation, and ABM Industries Incorporated are engaged in this field, as are large original equipment manufacturers such as Carrier Global Corporation and Trane Technologies Inc. In addition, we compete with several regional firms serving all or portions of the markets we target, such as BrightView, Holdings, Inc., Kellermeyer Bergensons Services, LLC, SMS Assist, LLC, and Ferandino & Son, Inc. Our principal competitors in the United Kingdom include CBRE Group, Inc., Bouygues UK Ltd., ISS UK Ltd., and MITIE Group plc. The key competitive factors in the building services industry include: (a) availability of qualified personnel and managers; (b) service quality and technical expertise; (c) cost structure and the ability to control project costs; (d) price; and (e) geographic diversity. Due to our size, our technical capability and management experience, and our geographic presence, we believe our building services operations are in a strong competitive position. However, there are relatively few barriers to entry into the building services industry. 
The market for providing industrial services includes large national providers, as well as numerous regional companies. In the manufacture of heat exchangers, we compete with both U.S. and foreign manufactures. Competitors within this industry include JVIC Catalyst Services, Matrix Service Company, Universal Plant Services, Inc., Turner Industries, Team, Inc., Cust-O-Fab, Inc., Dunn Heat Exchangers, Inc., and Wyatt Field Service Company, among others. The key competitive factors in the industrial services market consist of: (a) availability of skilled workforce, (b) technical expertise, (c) service, quality, and ability to respond quickly, (d) price, and (e) safety record. Due to our technical capabilities, skilled workforce, and safety record, we believe that we are in a strong competitive position in the industrial services markets that we serve. Because of the complex tasks associated with turnarounds, and the precision required in manufacturing heat exchangers, we believe that the barriers to entry in this business are significant.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 33,000 people, 29,000 of whom were located within the United States and 4,000 of whom were located in the United Kingdom. 
Based on the most recent information available from our latest filing with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the gender demographic of our U.S. employees was 89% male and 11% female. Additionally, based on such information, our U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics:

Employee Demographic | % of Total
White | 69 | %
Hispanic / Latinx | 20 | %
Black / African American | 7 | %
Asian | 2 | %
Multiracial, Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander | 2 | %

Approximately 59% of our employees are represented by various unions pursuant to approximately 400 collective bargaining agreements between our individual subsidiaries and local unions, as well as two collective bargaining agreements that are national in scope. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
Our ability to execute complex projects for our customers, and to perform all of our services with the excellence that makes us an industry leader, depends on our success in attracting and retaining skilled labor in a competitive market. We therefore strive to be and remain an employer of choice for the most talented employees in each of the industries and markets in which we operate. This begins with offering competitive employee compensation and benefits packages, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of each individual in our diverse organization, which include:
•Health and Welfare Plans: All full-time employees who do not participate in union plans are offered a range of choices among medical, dental and vision plans, life, accident, dependent and disability insurance, and pre-tax health spending accounts that include employer contributions. 
•Retirement Savings: We help provide our employees with financial security by offering a 401(k) Savings Plan and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, both of which include company matching contributions.
•Degree Assistance: Eligible employees may apply for reimbursement for job-related courses or courses taken as part of a curriculum for a business or job-related degree at an accredited institution.
•Employee Assistance Program: Through our Employee Assistance Program, we offer our employees, and their dependents or household members, access to services and counseling on a variety of personal, professional, legal, and financial matters, at no cost. 
Key to our attraction and retention of employees is our commitment to our EMCOR Values and our focus on employee safety and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our Board of Directors and senior leadership engage in oversight and management, respectively, of our significant human capital initiatives. Our Board of Directors is regularly briefed and provides input on key human capital initiatives and metrics.
Commitment to Core Values
We are committed to our EMCOR Values of Mission First: Integrity, Discipline, and Transparency and People Always: Mutual Respect and Trust, Commitment to Safety, and Teamwork. We constantly strive to ensure these values are reflected in how we do business every day, from our corporate culture and “tone at the top,” established by our Board of Directors and management team, to the critical work performed by all of our people at every level throughout our organization. We reinforce our EMCOR Values through many ongoing initiatives. Our EMCOR Values are embodied in our policies and procedures, including our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. We also regularly provide training on these values, both at time of hire and on an ongoing, periodic basis. In addition, to develop and reinforce our values company-wide, and empower our leaders to perform at the highest levels, senior leaders are invited to our Leadership for Results course at Babson College and our Leading with Character program at the Thayer Leadership Development Group at West Point. 
Workplace Safety
We believe that our focus on employee safety and well-being is reflected in our results. In a year in which our employees worked a total of approximately 73 million hours, the second highest in our history, the Company’s Total Recordable Incident Rate in 2020 was approximately 1.20, which was nearly 60% lower than the most recently available industry average of 2.90. This represents our twelfth consecutive year with a Total Recordable Incident Rate which was less than half the industry average. Our position as an industry leader in safety begins with a strong culture of care and vigilance embodied in our EMCOR Values and is supported by a comprehensive suite of training, resources, and analytics. These include: (a) our signature Be There for Life! Zero Injuries Program and Be Vigilant! Campaign, (b) in-person and online training tools and best practice guides available through our company intranet, (c) a 24-hour incident reporting hotline, and (d) a cross-company Change the Way We Work Program to share and champion best safety practices across our range of businesses. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse workforce is important to the long-term success of our business. We actively seek to increase the diversity of our workforce and to practice our commitment to diversity and inclusion in hiring, development, and training. This extends to our senior leadership and Board of Directors, where we require that any slate of candidates for a named executive officer or other corporate officer position, and new management-supported director nominees, include individuals from underrepresented demographics. We have also designed and implemented policies and practices to promote a workplace free from discrimination, including our Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Policy, the implementation, effectiveness, and reporting requirements of which are overseen by our designated Affirmative Action Officer.
We strive to help all our employees realize their full potential with an equal opportunity to succeed. We work to unlock the full potential of all employees at every level through: (a) the EMCOR Manager Certificate Program, which promotes supervisory management skills, (b) our Degree Assistance Program, which provides tuition reimbursement for continuing education, and (c) the resources available to all employees on our online learning platform, the EMCOR Learning Center, which includes thousands of on-demand training courses on a wide range of topics. 
In furtherance of our EMCOR Values, all EMCOR employees are required to complete annual diversity & inclusion training, and our current and future leaders undergo implicit association and unconscious bias training. 
Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
Our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations (“remaining performance obligations”) at December 31, 2020 were $4.59 billion. Remaining performance obligations increase with awards of new contracts and decrease as we perform work and recognize revenue on existing contracts. We include a project within our remaining performance obligations at such time as the project is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Our remaining performance obligations include amounts related to contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total transaction price can be made.
Remaining performance obligations include unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts. Although many of our construction contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers, in accordance with industry practice, we do not limit the amount of unrecognized revenue included within remaining performance obligations for these contracts as the risk of cancellation is very low due to the inherent substantial economic penalty that our customers would incur upon cancellation or termination. We believe our reported remaining performance obligations for our construction contracts are firm and contract cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us.
Remaining performance obligations also include unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of service contracts. However, to the extent a service contract includes a cancellation clause which allows for the termination of such contract by either party without a substantive penalty, the remaining contract term, and therefore, the amount of unrecognized revenues included within remaining performance obligations, is limited to the notice period required for the termination. 
Our remaining performance obligations are comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business, (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which the variable consideration constraint does not apply, and (e) other forms of variable consideration to the extent that such variable consideration has been included within the transaction price of our contracts. Such claim and other variable consideration amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. 
We estimate that approximately 83% of our remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 will be recognized as revenues during 2021.
