FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements in this document and any documents incorporated by reference, including any statements as to operational and financial projections, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses’ or our industries’ actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, or changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. Particular risks facing us include business, internal operations, legal and regulatory risks, costs of raw materials, pricing pressures, and changes in the economy. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management’s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets.
All the forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” and in any documents incorporated by reference herein that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new businesses and product lines. We cannot predict these new risk factors, and we cannot assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no obligation to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this document.
BUSINESS
Our Business
SPX FLOW, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“SPX FLOW,” ‘‘the Company,’’ “we,” “us,” or “our”) operate in two business segments. Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, SPX FLOW innovates with customers to help feed and enhance the world by designing, delivering and servicing high value process solutions at the heart of growing and sustaining our diverse communities. The product offerings of the Company's continuing operations are concentrated in process technologies that perform mixing, blending, fluid handling, separation, thermal heat transfer and other activities that are integral to processes performed across a wide variety of sanitary and industrial markets. In 2019, SPX FLOW had approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenues with continuing operations in more than 30 countries and sales in more than 140 countries, with approximately 40%, 33%, and 27% from sales into the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively.
Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, mixers, filters, air dryers, hydraulic tools, homogenizers, separators and heat exchangers, along with the related aftermarket parts and services, supports global industries, including food and beverage, chemical processing, compressed air and mining. From an end market perspective, in 2019, approximately 47% of our revenues were from sales into the food and beverage end markets and approximately 53% were from sales into the industrial end markets. Our core strengths include expertise in rotating, actuating and hydraulic equipment, a highly skilled workforce, global capabilities, product breadth, and a deep application knowledge that enables us to optimize configuration and create custom-engineered solutions for diverse processes.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our continuing operations are organized into two reportable segments — the Food and Beverage segment and the Industrial segment. The following summary describes the products and services offered by our reportable segments:
Food and Beverage:  The Food and Beverage reportable segment operates in a regulated, global industry with customers who demand highly engineered, process solutions. Key demand drivers include dairy consumption, emerging market capacity expansion, sustainability and productivity initiatives, customer product innovation and food safety. Key products for the segment include homogenizers, pumps, valves, separators and heat exchangers. We also design and assemble process systems that integrate many of these products for our customers. Key brands include APV, Gerstenberg Schroeder, Seital and Waukesha Cherry-Burrell. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Fristam Pumps, GEA Group AG, Krones AG, Südmo, Tetra Pak International S.A. and various regional companies.
Industrial: The Industrial reportable segment primarily serves customers in the chemical, air treatment, mining, pharmaceutical, marine, shipbuilding, infrastructure construction, general industrial and water treatment industries. Key demand drivers of this segment are tied to macroeconomic conditions and growth in the respective end markets we serve. Key products for the segment are air dryers, filtration equipment, mixers, pumps, hydraulic technologies and heat exchangers. Key brands include Airpel, APV, Bolting Systems, Bran+Luebbe, Deltech, Hankison, Jemaco, Johnson Pump, LIGHTNIN, Power Team and Stone. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Chemineer Inc., EKATO, Enerpac, IDEX Viking Pump, KSB AG, Lewa, Milton Roy, Parker Domnick Hunter, Prominent and various regional companies.
Divestitures
We periodically review and negotiate potential divestitures in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. As a result of this continuous review, we initiated a process in 2019 to divest a substantial portion of our former Power and Energy reportable segment, excluding the Bran+Luebbe product line (collectively, the “Disposal Group”). In connection with this initiative, we intend to narrow our strategic focus by separating our process solutions technologies, comprised of our Food and Beverage and our Industrial reportable segments, plus the Bran+Luebbe product line, from our flow control application technologies, comprised of the Disposal Group. Given the specific capabilities that are unique to each category of technologies and businesses, our further intent is that each business will, through a process of separation, be positioned to improve its respective service to customers through the narrowing of such strategic focus.
In connection with the divestiture process described above, we reported the Disposal Group as “held-for-sale,” and a discontinued operation, effective as of the end of our second quarter of 2019. As the operations and organizational structure of the remaining business of Power and Energy (primarily the Bran+Luebbe product line as noted above) have been absorbed into the Industrial reportable segment, and the operating results of the Industrial reportable segment (now including the Bran+Luebbe product line) are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, we have reclassified the results of that remaining business into the Industrial reportable segment. The results of operations, cash flows, and assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations and our Industrial segment, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
In November 2019, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which we agreed, indirectly through certain of our subsidiaries, to sell the Disposal Group to the Buyer for a gross purchase price of $475.0 (the “Transaction”). The gross purchase price of $475.0 is subject to (i) reductions based upon the level of certain deductions of the Disposal Group at the closing date, and (ii) certain adjustments based upon the level of net working capital, cash and debt of the Disposal Group at the closing date. The deductions include, for example, components of the Contract Liabilities and certain other current and long-term liabilities of the Disposal Group, as well as deductions for budgeted but un-incurred capital expenditures and other business infrastructure costs measured over periods defined in the Sale Agreement, but in all cases expiring at the closing date. We expect the Transaction to close in the first half of 2020.
See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture process, as well as further details regarding the results, major classes of assets and liabilities, and significant non-cash operating items and capital expenditures of discontinued operations.
Unless otherwise indicated, amounts reported in Part I of this Form 10-K pertain to continuing operations only.
Acquisitions
We have not acquired any businesses since SPX FLOW was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company from SPX Corporation in September 2015. As part of our long-term strategy, we plan to evaluate potential acquisitions that (a) are complementary to our existing products and services, (b) increase our relevance to customers and our capabilities to serve them, (c) expand our global capabilities and accelerate our localization strategy and (d) expand our end market reach.
Research and Development
We are engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 129 domestic and 274 foreign patents, including 25 patents that were issued in 2019, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors—Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.”
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, titanium, nickel and petroleum-based products. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower the overall cost of raw materials. In addition, due to our diverse product and service offering, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. However, we are not dependent on any one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Lastly, we continue to centralize certain aspects of supply chain management in an effort to ensure adequate materials are available for production at low cost. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors—The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.”
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors are diverse, ranging from large multi-nationals to regional and local companies. Our principal global competitors include Alfa Laval AB, GEA Group AG, IDEX Corporation, and Tetra Pak International S.A. We do not have any one competitor with all the same product offerings, nor do we have any one competitor which serves all the same end markets. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends on a variety of factors including breadth of product offering, product quality, engineering strength, brand reputation, lead times, global capabilities, service capabilities, and cost. As many of our products are sold through distributors and independent representatives, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. 
Backlog
Information with respect to the backlog of the Company's segments at December 31, 2019 is presented in “MD&A—Results of Reportable Segments.”
Environmental Matters
See “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” “Risk Factors—We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters” and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 
Employment 
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 5,000 employees. Certain of our non-U.S. employee groups are covered by various collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are 
subject to potential collective labor campaigns, work stoppages, collective labor negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 
Executive Officers 
See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 
Other Matters 
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 
The financial results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. In aggregate, our businesses tend to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year. Additionally, timing of revenue recognition on large Food and Beverage systems projects and large Industrial orders may cause significant fluctuations in financial performance from period to period.
