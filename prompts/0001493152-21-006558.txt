Our Current Business
 
COVID-19 update
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic prompting government-imposed quarantines, suspension of in-person attendance of academic programs, and cessation of certain travel and business closures. The United States has entered a recession as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may prolong and exacerbate the negative impact on us. Although we expect the availability of vaccines and various treatments with respect to COVID-19 to have an overall positive impact on business conditions in the aggregate over time, the exact timing of these positive developments is uncertain. In December 2020, the United States began distributing two vaccines that, in addition to other vaccines under development, are expected to help to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 once they are widely distributed. If the vaccines prove less effective than currently understood by the scientific community and the United States Food and Drug Administration, or if there are problems with the acceptance, availability, timing or other difficulties with widely distributing the vaccines, the pandemic may last longer, and could continue to impact our business for longer, than we currently expect. In response to COVID-19, governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter in place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Although many governmental measures have had specific expiration dates, some of those measures have already been extended more than once, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration of such measures and the implementation of any potential future measures, especially if cases increase across the United States, with the potential for additional challenges resulting from the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, some of which may be more transmissible than the initial strain. Such measures have impacted, and may continue to affect, our workforce, operations, suppliers and customers. We reduced the size of our workforce following the onset of COVID-19 and may need to take additional actions to further reduce the size of our workforce in the future; such reductions incur costs, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to rehire our workforce in the event our business experiences a subsequent recovery. We took steps to curtail our operating expenses and conserve cash. We may elect or need to take additional remedial measures in the future as the information available to us continues to develop, including with respect to our workforce, relationships with our third-party vendors, and our customers. There is no certainty that the remedial measures we have implemented to date, or any additional remedial steps we may take in the future, will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19. Further, such measures could potentially materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and create additional risks for us. Any escalation of COVID-19 cases across many of the markets we serve could have a negative impact on us. Specifically, we could be adversely impacted by limitations on our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring our stores to close or employees to remain at home; limitation of carriers to deliver our product to customers; product shortages; limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner. These events could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
 
The ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the full extent of the material negative impact on our financial and operational results, will depend on future developments, such as the duration and severity of the pandemic, the extent of any increases in cases across the United States, and the related length of its impact on the global economy, as well as the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The resumption of our normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers and/or third-party service providers. Furthermore, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable. Due to the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations, but our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have already been materially adversely impacted, and we anticipate they will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on global economic conditions. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may also be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors, such as any increase in COVID-19 infections. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its national and, to some extent, global economic impact, including the current recession and any recession that may occur in the future.
 
The success of our business depends on our global operations, including our supply chain and consumer demand, among other things. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced shortages in inventory due to manufacturing issues, a reduction in the volume of sales in some parts of our business, such as rental sales and direct website sales, and a reduction in personnel due to lockdown related issues. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect this impact; however, we expect that this trend may continue and the full extent of the impact is unknown. In recent months, some governmental agencies in the US and Europe, where we produce the largest percentage of our sales, have lifted certain restrictions. However, if customer demand continues to be low, our future equipment sales, subscriber activations and sales margin will be impacted. We have implemented several measures to minimize the impact on our operations and sustain our liquidity position, including receiving support through the US payroll protection program loan (“PPP”), a low interest, fixed rate loan provided under the UK’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan (“CBILS”) and the deferral of certain UK taxes. We have also worked with our product suppliers to ensure we will continue to have sufficient inventory levels on hand to meet consumer demand.
 
The Company’s reliance on securing additional capital for its public company expenses may be impaired due to the effect on the U.S. financial markets. The inability to obtain appropriate financing, may affect its compliance requirements as a public company. The Company has been using its working capital from its operating subsidiaries, to support its public company expenses. The continued drain on its working capital have forced the Company to incur cutbacks, which may affect its future operating revenue as well as, its ability to continue operations.
 
As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced shortages in inventory due to manufacturing and logistical issues, a reduction in the volume of sales in some parts of our business, such as rental sales and direct website sales, and a reduction in personnel due to lockdown related issues. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect this impact; however, we expect that this trend may continue and the full extent of the impact is unknown.


Orbsat Corp provides Mobile Satellite Services (“MSS”) solutions to fulfil the growing global demand for satellite-enabled voice, data, personnel and asset tracking, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity services. We provide these solutions for businesses, governments, military, humanitarian organizations, and individual users, enabling them to communicate, connect to the internet, track and monitor remote assets and lone workers, or request SOS assistance via satellite from anywhere in the world, even in the most remote and hostile of environments.


Around 40% of the world’s population has no access to the internet and much of the world has no cellular coverage1. Our vision is to collaborate with innovative partners to deliver low cost, reliable and easily accessible global satellite communications solutions in areas where no other forms of communication exist.


We provide voice, data communications, IoT and M2M services via Geostationary and Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) satellite constellations and offer reliable connectivity in areas where terrestrial wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are limited, including remote land areas, open ocean, airways, the polar regions and regions where terrestrial networks are not operational, for example due to political conflicts and natural or man-made disasters.
 
There is an increasing requirement for on-demand connectivity which we support with products and services developed to deliver reliable solutions globally via leading commercial satellite network operators. Billions of dollars are projected to be spent on new and modernized satellite constellations2 and our partner networks including Globalstar, Intelsat, Iridium, Inmarsat, Thuraya and Viasat have already developed and launched satellites capable of delivering advanced high-speed voice and data services anywhere on the planet. Our products and services enable users on the ground to connect to these existing networks and we intend to pursue new relationships with next generation satellite constellation operators likely to offer service in the future.


We have expertise and long-term experience in providing tracking and monitoring services via satellite, specifically through the Globalstar Low Earth Orbit satellite network. We own unique network infrastructure devices, known as appliqués, which are located in various Globalstar ground stations around the world and provide the signal receipt and processing technology that enables and powers the Globalstar simplex data service. Our ownership of these appliqués provides us with competitive access to the global simplex data service which addresses the market demand for a small and cost-effective solution for sending data, such as geographic coordinates, from assets or individuals in remote locations to a central monitoring station and is used in numerous applications such as tracking vehicles, asset shipments, livestock, and monitoring unattended remote assets.


We believe the potential commercial requirement for satellite-based tracking devices using the Globalstar network is vast and we intend to begin launching a range of company branded tracking products and associated messaging plans during the first half of 2021, including our SolarTrack solar powered satellite tracking device which we announced in January 2021.


In addition to our main core focus on MSS products and services, we also provide tracking and monitoring solutions using Automatic Identification System (AIS), 2G-5G, Push-to-Talk and two-way radio technology.
 
We generate revenue from both the provision of services and the sale of equipment. Higher margin recurring service revenue from the sale of monthly, annual, and prepaid airtime or messaging plans has historically represented an increasing proportion of our revenue, and we expect that trend to continue as we introduce new products requiring associated airtime or messaging plans.
 
We provide our products and services directly to end users and reseller networks located both in the United States and internationally through our subsidiaries, U.S. based Orbital Satcom Corp (“Orbital Satcom”) and U.K. based Global Telesat Communications Limited (“GTC”). We have a physical presence in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as an ecommerce storefront presence in 16 countries across 5 continents. We have a diverse geographical customer base having provided solutions to more than 50,000 customers located in more than 165 countries across every continent in the world.
 
In the first quarter of 2021, we intend to open an office in Washington D.C. to target increased sales to US government customers through channels such as the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”). The U.S. government spends billions of dollars each year on satellite communications products and services3 as it seeks to modernize and improve its communications and connectivity. To directly address this opportunity, Orbsat is currently seeking to build a dedicated government sector business unit focused on serving the growing secure communications needs of US government customers.

MSS Products
 
Our MSS products rely on satellite networks for voice, data and tracking connectivity and thus are not reliant on cell towers or other local infrastructure. As a result, our MSS solutions are suitable for recreational travelers and adventurers, government and military users, and corporations and individuals wishing to communicate or connect to the internet from remote locations, or in the event of an emergency such as a power outage, following a hurricane or other natural disaster during which regular cell phone, telephone and internet service may not be available.
 
Our satellite communications products enable users to make voice calls, send and recent text messages and emails, and transmit GPS location coordinates from anywhere on the planet, no matter how remote the location and regardless of the availability of local communication infrastructure. Our range of satellite data products allow users anywhere in the world to connect to the internet, stream live video, and communicate via voice and data applications.
 
We intend to be a leading provider of GPS enabled emergency locator distress beacons that can save lives, on land and at sea. Our distress beacons enable essential communication between our customers and search and rescue organizations during emergency situations and pinpoint locational information to Search and Rescue services, essential during an emergency.
 
We provide a wide range of satellite tracking devices used to monitor the location, movements, and history of almost anything that moves. We specialize in offering satellite tracking services through the Globalstar satellite network and have supplied tens of thousands of tracking devices which are used around the world to locate lone workers, track shipping containers, livestock, vehicles, and vessels along with many other types of assets.
 
Our principal focus is on growing sales of our existing satellite-based hardware, airtime and related services, specifically services attracting recurring revenue for the Company. Additionally, during the first half of 2021 we intend to launch our own brand of tracking device for use by retail, corporate and governmental customers worldwide which we expect will further increase future revenue.
 
The first product launched by the Company, SolarTrack, is a compact, lightweight, IoT tracking device powered by the sun and operating on one of the most modern satellite networks in the world. It is designed for tracking and monitoring anything that moves, or any remote asset used outdoors, almost anywhere in the world and we anticipate strong demand from customers looking for a low cost, low maintenance tracking device to monitor remote assets.
 
Online Storefronts
 
We operate two e-commerce websites offering a range of MSS products and solutions through our subsidiaries, Orbital Satcom, which targets customers in North and South America, and GTC which targets customers in the UK, EU, Middle East, Asia and rest of the world. These websites produce sales and attract enquiries from customers and potential customers from all around the world. Over the long term, we plan to develop additional country-specific websites to target customers in South America, Asia and Europe where we anticipate there will be substantial further demand for our products.
 
In addition to our two main e-commerce websites, we make portable satellite voice, data and tracking solutions easier to find and buy online through our various third-party e-commerce storefronts such as Amazon and Walmart. We currently operate 16 storefronts across various countries in 5 continents. We have invested in personnel to translate our listings correctly in the different countries we are represented in and intend to regularly improve and increase our listings on all e-commerce sites. We currently have more than 8,000 product listings on all third-party sites and invest significantly in inventory to hold at Amazon’s various warehouses around the world to ensure that orders are shipped to customers as quickly as possible. The products include handheld satellite phones, personal and asset tracking devices, portable high-speed broadband terminals, and satellite Wi-Fi hotspots. Our Amazon online marketplaces represented approximately 73.3% and 56.9% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and we anticipate that these marketplaces will continue to represent a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Should there be a disruption of Amazon services or our ability to maintain storefronts with Amazon, our sales will likely decrease and we would have to seek other distribution methods to sell our products online, which may be costly.
 
With consumer behavior drastically changing as a result of Covid-19, e-commerce traffic witnessed double-digit gains in 2020 as stores closed and shoppers used digital options. This significant change in consumer shopping habits resulted in 42% of U.S. and U.K. consumers stating that they would choose to buy via Amazon if shopping online4. As a result, we experienced an increase in sales through our global Amazon storefronts during 2020 as compared to previous years.
 
Our e-commerce storefronts enable us to attract a significantly diversified level of sales from all over the world, ensuring we are not overly reliant on any single market or sector for our sales revenue. Furthermore, many products we sell require subscription-based services which allow us to increase our recurring revenue airtime sales.
 
Mapping and Tracking Portal
 
Our advanced subscription-based mapping and tracking portal, GTCTrack, is available for use by registered customers who pay a monthly fee to access it. This mapping portal provides a universal and hardware-agnostic, cloud-based data visualization and management platform that allows managers to track, command, and control assets in near-real-time. Asset location reports including position, speed, altitude, heading and past location and movement history reports for a wide range of tracking devices and other products sold by us are available through GTCTrack.
Industry and Market
 
We compete in the mobile satellite products and services sector of the global communications industry. The products and airtime that we sell are intended to meet users’ needs for connectivity in all locations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks do not exist, do not provide sufficient coverage, or are impaired. Government organizations, including military and intelligence agencies and disaster response agencies, non-governmental organizations and industrial operations and support teams depend on mobile voice and data satellite communications products and services on a regular basis. Businesses with global operations require reliable communications services when operating in remote locations around the world. Mobile satellite services users span many sectors, including emergency services, maritime, aviation, government, utilities, oil and gas, mining, recreation, forestry, heavy equipment, construction, and transportation, among others. We believe many of our customers view satellite communications products and services as critical to their daily operations.

There is an existing, and we believe significantly growing, multi-billion-dollar global market for a small and cost-effective solution for receiving and processing mobile voice and data communications from remote locations used in applications such as tracking vehicles or asset shipments, monitoring unattended remote assets or mobile security. Over the past two decades, the global mobile satellite services market has experienced significant growth. Increasingly, better-tailored, improved-technology products and services are creating new channels of demand for mobile satellite services. Growth in demand for mobile satellite voice services is driven by the declining cost of these services, the diminishing size and lower costs of the devices, as well as heightened demand by governments, businesses and individuals for ubiquitous global voice and data coverage. We believe our solutions are ideally suited for industries such as maritime, aviation, government/military, emergency/humanitarian services, mining, forestry, oil and gas, heavy equipment, transportation and utilities, as well as recreational users. We do not tailor our products and services to different types of customers as in our experience military, non-profit, government and recreational users tend to purchase the same types of products and services.
 
Competition
 
The global satellite communications industry is highly competitive. In certain regions, such as North America, we currently face substantial competition from other service providers that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. In other regions, such as the UK and EU, we have a strong presence and are one of the leading providers of satellite communicators, emergency locator beacons and satellite tracking devices. We compete primarily on the basis of coverage, quality, portability, pricing and in the case of our e-commerce storefronts, availability of services and products.
 
The competitors for our satellite telecommunications services and products are other resellers of leading satellite networks such as Iridium, Inmarsat, Thuraya and Globalstar, some of which are also our suppliers. We expect the competition for our satellite telecommunications services and our satellite tracking and monitoring services to increase significantly as market demand accelerates.
 
We believe that we are well positioned to compete for the satellite telecommunications services business largely on a cost basis and our global e-commerce presence, which makes products more accessible to buy as compared to more traditional methods of purchasing e.g., bricks and mortar storefronts.
 
Our competitive strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success:
 

● | Our global presence enables us to compete in various markets around the world, with our multi-lingual personnel allowing us to respond to global customer inquiries with 24/7/365 customer support 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our significant expertise in global e-commerce sales, allowing us to maintain a competitive advantage over traditional methods of purchase through “brick and mortar” stores. This has taken a particular import during the recent COVID-19 pandemic 
● | Our significant levels of inventory stored in fulfilment centers around the world enable us to quickly secure customer orders against competitors who may not hold available inventory 
● | Economies of scale of a leading provider of MSS product allows us to offer competitive prices for our products 
● | Long-term contracts and experience with Globalstar allow us to compete competitively on satellite tracking opportunities 
● | A diverse customer base with no single customer representing more than 1.5% of our annual gross sales revenue, and no single country representing more than 25% of our gross annual sales revenue as of December 31, 2020. This diversification reasonably permits the Company not to rely on any single customer, or group of customers, on any single product line, or any specific geographic area. It is noteworthy, however, that our Amazon sales represent the majority of our sales effort in the last 24 months. 

 
Our business strategy
 
We intend to achieve our mission and further grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 

● | Increased product offerings - we are constantly increasing our product lines and offerings and will continue to do so in the future. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Government sourced revenue - We are opening new e-commerce storefronts around the world to develop sales in new markets. Our new Washington D.C. office will target US government/GSA sales which have not historically represented a significant part of our sales revenue. We will also recruit experienced government sales professionals to assist with this plan. We plan to become an approved seller on the US Government’s GSA Schedule, which gives federal, and in some cases state and local buyers, access to a great number of commercial products and services at negotiated ceiling prices. Schedule purchases represent approximately 21% of overall federal procurement spending. 
● | Product innovation - We will continue to launch innovative own branded products, such as our SolarTrack solar powered satellite tracking device, to differentiate us and gain a competitive edge over other MSS suppliers. 
● | Future acquisitions - We will seek suitable acquisition opportunities to further increase our scale, expand sales and access in new markets and sectors. 

Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain our trade secrets. All of our employees and consultants are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights.
Regulatory Matters
 
Government contract laws and regulations affect how we will do business with our customers, and in some instances, will impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of any then existing contracts or the inability to bid on future contracts. We intend our Orbital Satcom subsidiary to become qualified as a government contractor. Our products may also be subject to regulation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission that regulate wireless communications.

Sources and Availability of Components
 
Certain materials and equipment for our products are custom made for those products and are dependent upon either a single or limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier could cause delays in delivery of the products if another supplier cannot promptly be found or if the quality of such replacement supplier’s components is inferior or unacceptable. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced shortages in inventory due to manufacturing and logistical issues.
 
Our Risks and History of Losses
 
Our ability to achieve our mission and execute our strategies is subject to certain challenges, risks and uncertainties, including, among others:
 

● | Our ability to obtain sufficient funding to expand our business and respond to business opportunities 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner 
● | Our ability to successfully improve our production efficiencies and economies of scale 
● | Our ability to manage our supply chain to continue to satisfy our future operation needs 
● | Our ability to retain our market share in our industry 

 
We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we have incurred net losses of $2.7 million, $1.4 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $13.8 million. We expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses prior to recording sufficient revenue from our operations to offset these expenses. In the United States, we expect to incur additional losses as a result of the costs associated with operating as a public company.
