Overview
 
We are engaged in the development of innovative technologies and materials that we believe will reduce the cost per watt of electricity generated by Photovoltaic (PV) solar modules and the cost per watt of storing electrical energy.
 
The process for producing electricity from sunlight is known as Photovoltaics. Photovoltaic is the science of capturing and converting sun light into electricity. We have developed BioBacksheetR, a high performance environment friendly back sheet for Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. BioBacksheetR is a bottom most layer of the conventional PV panels that provides electrical insulation, protection from the environment, and an increase in the panel output.
 
Our current focus is on developing technologies and materials for storing electrical energy.  We are currently investigating high capacity silicon alloy anode materials recognizing the fact that the overall battery capacity is determined by combination of both cathode and anode. We are focusing our research and product development efforts on increasing the storage capacity as well as lowering the cost of storage compared to existing electrical storage devices.
 
Industry Overview
 
The solar industry relies on two distinctly different solar energy technologies. Solar energy can be converted directly into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) devices or into heat by solar thermal devices. PV devices convert sunlight directly into electricity through a photovoltaic cell, commonly called a solar cell, a non-mechanical device usually made from silicon alloys. Solar thermal devices, on the other hand, are typically used for directly heating swimming pools, heating water for domestic use, and space heating of buildings.
 
Our product development focus had been based on PV technology, thus we are currently a part of the PV segment of the industry. “Photovoltaics (PV) is derived from the words photo, meaning light, and voltaic, meaning voltage producing. Sunlight, not heat, fuels photovoltaic cells. The cells, made mostly of the semiconductor silicon, convert sunlight directly into electricity.
 
In PV, light particles called photons penetrate the cell and knock electrons free from the silicon atoms, creating an electric current. As long as light flows into the cell, electrons flow out of the cell. The cell does not use up its electrons and lose power, similar to a battery, as it is a converter that turns one kind of energy (sun light) into another (flowing electrons). PV cells are typically combined into modules that hold about 40 cells. Ten such modules are mounted in photovoltaic arrays. Such arrays can be used to generate electricity for a single building or, in large numbers, for a power plant.
 
With all of these PV panels being installed, there is still one major challenge that prevents solar from being a primary and reliable source of power – the sun does not shine at night. As a result, solar users will switch to using electricity from the local power company during the evening hours. This switch causes sudden spikes in power demand on the grid and creates havoc at the local power company because the grid is not designed to respond to rapid demand changes. The key to solving this problem is efficient electrical energy storage systems that can be charged and discharged rapidly, day in and day out. This will time-shift daytime solar energy for nighttime use with minimal reliance on the power grid.

According to a 2015 report by Solar Energy Industries Association, the demand for rooftop solar paired with energy storage systems will reach $1 billion in the U.S. by 2020, and will create pent up demand for cost effective solar energy storage solutions. Pairing solar panels with batteries means users can store power during the day and use it at night, reducing electricity bills. Those savings can be more significant for customers who pay higher rates for electricity during peak periods.
 
With a modern world running on electricity, the need for battery storage has never been greater. The ability to store energy, take it on the go, and use it later, has opened up a new world of “Killer Apps ” such as long range electric vehicles, iPhones, and storage of renewable wind and solar energy for later use. The key to enabling these Killer Apps is better and lower cost batteries.
 
According to a 2014 report from Lux Research, the global energy storage market will rise to $50 billion by the year 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of 8%. Much of the growth will be in electric vehicles, which will rise to $21 billion, followed by the incumbent consumer electronics segment such as iPhones, which will rise to $27 billion, with a reminder of $2.8 billion in stationary applications such as solar, back up power, and grid storage.
 
Research and Development
 
We developed robust bio-based components that meet the stringent thermal and durability requirements of current PV module manufacturing processes. We identified certain bio-based materials that are inherently durable, and we then applied proprietary material processes to enhance the desirable characteristics of these bio-based materials – turning them into robust and durable materials to be used as solar panel components.  Based on long term environmental testing performed by the Company, we believe our BioBacksheetR is more durable than conventional petroleum based back sheets available in the market today.
 
The BioBacksheetR successfully obtained Underwriters Laboratories’ (UL) material certification in February 2011.  This version of BioSolar back sheet (BioBacksheetR) is designed for conventional c-Si solar modules, which currently represents over 75 percent of solar modules produced in the world, as well as for certain thin film solar modules.  The relative thermal index (RTI) rating of 130 degree C by UL was issued during the 3nd quarter of 2012, and a number of PV panel manufacturers obtained certifications on their PV panels incorporating BioBacksheetR for UL/IEC.  
 
A key ingredient of BioBacksheetR is Nylon 11 derived from castor bean oil. We do not currently have an agreement with Arkema for the supply of Nylon 11 and there is currently no other known supplier of Nylon 11. If Nylon 11 becomes unavailable in the future, alternative materials such as Nylon 1010 or Nylon 12 can be substituted, for which there are many known suppliers. The Company currently does not manufacture BioBacksheetR, but the product is available for licensing.
 
We initially focused our energy storage development effort on high capacity cathode materials since most of today’s Li-ion batteries are “cathode limited.” With the goal of creating the company’s next generation super battery technology, we are currently investigating high capacity anode materials recognizing the fact that the overall battery capacity is determined by a combination of both cathode and anode. By integrating BioSolar’s high capacity cathode or anode, battery manufacturers will be able to create a super lithium-ion battery that can double the range of a Tesla, power an iPhone for two days straight, or store daytime solar energy for nighttime use.
 
Silicon (Si) is one of the most promising anode materials being considered for next generation, high energy and high power lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, Si anodes suffer from large capacity fading and tremendous volume changes during lithium-ion charge-discharge cycling. The strains due to the huge volume changes actually pulverizes the Si material and eventually lead to electrode shattering and delamination, which adversely affect the battery performance and cycle life. These are the primary challenges to the commercial use of Si for battery anodes, which the company intends to overcome.
 
We are currently sponsoring a research program at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to strengthen the engineering development efforts of its battery technology. Dr. Sung-Jin Cho, Assistant Professor in the Nanoengineering Department at the university, is the lead investigator of the sponsored research program.
