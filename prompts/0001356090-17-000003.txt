Item 1. | Business

At present rates of global industrialization and population growth, food and energy supplies and environmental and healthcare resources are becoming more scarce and/or costly. We believe it is not a viable option for mankind to continue on this path — new solutions will be necessary to preserve and globally expand a high quality of life. We believe that synthetic biology is a solution.
We believe we are a leader in the field of synthetic biology, an emerging and rapidly evolving discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems to enable rational, design-based control of cellular function for a specific purpose. Using our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, we design, build and regulate gene programs, which are DNA sequences that consist of key genetic components. A single gene program or a complex, multi-genic program is fabricated and stored within a DNA vector. Vectors are segments of DNA used as a vehicle to transmit genetic information. DNA vectors can, in turn, be introduced into cells in order to generate a simple or complex cellular system, which are the basic and complex cellular activities that take place within a cell and the interaction of those systems in the greater cellular environment. It is these genetically modified cell systems that can be used to produce biological effector molecules, or be employed directly to enable the development of new and improved products and manufacturing processes across a variety of end markets, including health, food, energy, environment and consumer. Our synthetic biology capabilities include the ability to precisely control the amount, location and modification of biological molecules to control the function and output of living cells and optimize for desired results at an industrial scale.
Working with our collaborators, we seek to create more effective, less costly and more sustainable solutions than can be provided through current industry practices. We believe our approach to synthetic biology can enable new and improved biotherapeutics, increase the productivity and quality of food crops and livestock, create sustainable alternative energy sources and chemical feed stocks, utilize biologically-based applications for the delivery of innovative consumer products and provide for a diverse set of environmental solutions. Our business model is to commercialize our technologies through exclusive channel collaborations, or ECCs, with collaborators that have industry expertise, development resources and sales and marketing capabilities to bring new and improved products and processes to market.
Our technologies combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. We efficiently engineer precise and complex gene programs across many cell types. We apply the engineering principle of a design-build-test-learn continuum, through which we accumulate knowledge about the characteristics and performance of gene programs and cell lines. This process of continuous learning allows us to enhance our ability to design and build improved and more complex gene programs and cellular systems.
While the field of synthetic biology is still emerging, the addressable markets that may benefit from this approach are large and well-established. In health, synthetic biology may provide new approaches to treating diseases, as well as improvements to the manufacture of existing products. It is estimated that the global biopharmaceuticals market is over $160 billion. While genetically modified salmon or trout may be considered new products, the global market for aquaculture was valued at approximately $157 billion in 2013. Genetically modified agricultural plants are already grown on approximately 180 million hectares around the world and are worth an estimated $15 billion. In energy, we are working to create novel, highly engineered organisms that use specific feedstocks to create commercially valuable end products, such as isobutanol, which already has a variety of technical and industrial applications and is also being investigated as a gasoline alternative.
We believe our technologies are broadly applicable across many diverse end markets, including some end markets that have failed to recognize the applicability of synthetic biology or failed to efficiently utilize biologically-based processes to produce products. Our business model entails the formation of ECCs with collaborators that have expertise within specific industry sectors. In our ECCs, we provide expertise in the engineering, fabrication and modification of gene programs and cellular 
5

systems, and our collaborators are responsible for providing commercial market and product development expertise, as well as sales and marketing capabilities. Generally, our collaborators compensate us through technology access fees, royalties, milestones and reimbursements of certain costs. This business model allows us to leverage our capabilities and capital across a broader landscape of product opportunities and end markets than we would be capable of addressing on our own. Alternatively, we may execute a research collaboration to develop an early-stage program pursuant to which we receive reimbursement for our development costs but the grant of exclusive commercial rights, and payment of the related access fee, are deferred until completion of an initial research program.
In certain strategic circumstances, we may enter into a joint venture, or JV, with a third party collaborator whereby we may contribute access to our technology, cash or both into the JV which we will jointly control with our ECC collaborator. We may be required to contribute additional capital to the JV, and we may be able to receive a higher financial return than we would normally receive from an ECC to the extent that we and our collaborator are successful in developing one or more products.
As we consider the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology techniques, we have identified a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of such technology. We believe that the strategic acquisition of certain such companies will allow us to develop and commercialize innovative products and create significant value for Intrexon. Our business model therefore includes the acquisition of certain product-focused companies that may leverage our technologies and expertise in order to expand their respective product applications.
What is synthetic biology?
History
Synthetic biology entails the application of engineering principles to biological systems for the purpose of designing and constructing new biological systems or redesigning/modifying existing biological systems. Biological systems are governed by DNA, the building blocks of gene programs, which control cellular processes by coding for the production of proteins and other molecules that have a functional purpose and by regulating the activities of these molecules. This regulation occurs via complex biochemical and cellular reactions working through intricate cell signaling pathways, and control over these molecules modifies the output of biological systems.
In the early 1970s, scientists utilized basic tools and procedures for transferring DNA from one organism to another. Foundational tools included: gene programs contained in vectors; enzymes that could cut DNA at specific sites; and enzymes that could "glue" two complementary segments of DNA together. Developments between 1980 and the end of the 20th century advanced the field of genetic engineering, including automated DNA sequencing, DNA amplification via PCR and the creation of genetically modified organisms. However, the simplistic "cut-and-paste" nature of the available tools, and the absence of genomic sequence information, significantly restricted the scope of early synthetic biology efforts.
More recently, synthetic biology has been enabled by the application of information technology and advanced statistical analysis, also known as bioinformatics, to genetic engineering, as well as by improvements in DNA synthesis. Synthetic biology aims to engineer gene-based programs or codes to modify cellular function to achieve a desired biological outcome. For example, applications may include the replacement of a defective protein with a functional protein to treat a broad range of human and animal disease states, or the production of multiple proteins through the regulation of several genes in a cell to produce petrochemicals.
Our approach
The essence of our approach is to apply synthetic biology by using an iterative process that is rapid, automated and highly reproducible, in which we:

• | Design genes of interest and gene programs utilizing knowledge of cellular pathways and protein function;


• | Build biological molecules, gene programs and their variants to optimize performance of the biological system;


• | Test gene programs by inserting them into cellular systems and comparing the result(s) to the intended effects; and


• | Learn by utilizing information gained in our iterative processes to create better gene programs and cellular systems using a more informed and efficient process to achieve improved outcomes.

6

As a result of our approach, we have developed extensive knowledge about many classes of DNA components and the rules governing their expression and activity. We have also assembled an inventory of these DNA components that we can use to rationally construct unique vectors rapidly and with predictable outcomes. The knowledge embedded in our DNA database allows us to create single gene and highly complex multigenic gene programs (an individual gene program containing multiple genes).
To support our approach, we have developed, acquired, and integrated a unique suite of technologies, and we continue to expand upon their capabilities. These technologies include: our UltraVector gene design and fabrication platform and its associated library of modular DNA components; Cell Systems Informatics; RheoSwitch inducible gene switch; AttSite Recombinases; Protein Engineering; Laser-Enabled Analysis and Processing, or LEAP; and ActoBiotics platform. These technologies are complementary in nature and share the following key characteristics:

• | Platform neutral — outcome oriented. We can work across different cell types with the objective of achieving the intended biological outcome allowing for product development across a broad spectrum of end markets.


• | Knowledge driven. We use statistical modeling tools and computational analysis to continually acquire more knowledge about biological systems and their design to continually improve our ability to develop new and improved products and processes for our collaborators.


• | Rationally designed. Our knowledge of biological systems and components allows us to design, build and select gene programs and predict the probable outcome of these programs.


• | Capable of complexity. Our technologies enable the design and precise control of complex biological molecules and multigenic gene programs.


• | Industrial scale. We use engineering principles and automation to enable products based on synthetic biology that are commercially viable.

Our competitive strengths
We believe that our technologies, our ability to work across multiple host systems and our approach to synthetic biology — design-build-test-learn — give us a competitive advantage over traditional industrial processes as well as current approaches to synthetic biology.
We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:
We have a suite of proprietary and complementary technologies
We have built a suite of proprietary and complementary technologies that provides us with a comprehensive ability to design, create, modify and regulate gene programs and cellular systems across multiple host systems (human, animal, insect, plant, fungi, and bacteria). By virtue of the complementary nature of our technologies, we are able to provide our collaborators with a diverse array of capabilities, representing a "one stop shop" to potentially develop and commercialize new and differentiated products enabled by synthetic biology.
Our design-build-test-learn continuum allows us to design and build improved and more complex gene programs
We have developed a core expertise and technologies to design, build and test complex gene programs, as well as technologies to isolate cells that best express the desired biological output. We have also developed an extensive bioinformatic software platform that combines information technology with advanced statistical analysis for DNA design and genetic engineering, enabling us to continually learn and create optimal conditions for our gene programs. Our approach allows us to build improved and more complex gene programs.
We believe we are a leader in synthetic biology
We believe we are the first company focused exclusively on applying synthetic biology across a broad spectrum of end markets and have been working in the field since 1998. Over the last 19 years, we have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in the design, modification and regulation of gene programs. We believe all of these factors, coupled with our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, provide us with a first-mover advantage in synthetic biology.

We serve large and diverse end markets with high built-in demand
A vast number of products consumed globally are or can be produced using biologically-based processes. Natural resources are becoming more scarce as demand exceeds supply, creating unmet needs for improvements in development and manufacturing. As a result, the need for complex biologically engineered molecules such as those enabled by our synthetic biology technologies is large and spans multiple industries, including health, food, energy, environment, and consumer. Each of these markets faces unique challenges, however all have unmet needs for improvements in product development and manufacturing that can result in savings of both cost and time as compared to traditional means of industrial design and production. Because synthetic biology has the potential to deliver against these unmet needs, we believe that significant demand already exists for improved products enabled by synthetic biology. Additionally, there are markets utilizing traditional industrial processes that have failed to recognize the significant improvement in performance that could be achieved using synthetic biology.
We have a scalable ECC business model that allows us to leverage the broad potential of synthetic biology
We believe our ECC business model is a capital efficient and rapid way for us to participate in a more diversified range of product opportunities and industrial end markets than would otherwise be possible, including health, food, energy, environment, and consumer. Our collaborators are primarily responsible for providing market and product development expertise, as well as sales and marketing capabilities. Generally, our collaborators compensate us through technology access fees, royalties, milestones and reimbursements of certain costs. Our ECC business model allows us to participate in the potential upside from products that are enabled by our technologies across an extensive range of industries, without the need for us to invest considerable resources in bringing individual programs to market. Moreover, we believe that we will increasingly engage in ECCs in new fields at an accelerating pace with well-recognized collaborators.
We have experienced management and employees
Our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Randal J. Kirk, and our President, Geno Germano, consists of executives with a track record of success in building and managing research and development-driven companies. Our Chief Science Officer, Thomas D. Reed, was responsible for the initial conception and creation of our UltraVector technology platform. As of December 31, 2016, we had 446 research and development employees.
Our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies
We apply the potential of synthetic biology through our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies that combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. This enables us to engineer precise and complex gene programs across many cell types rapidly and inexpensively. These technologies include: our UltraVector gene design and fabrication platform and its associated library of modular DNA components; Cell Systems Informatics; RheoSwitch inducible gene switch; AttSite Recombinases; Protein Engineering; LEAP processing; and ActoBiotics platform. 
In order to create a highly functional biological system, we recognize the complexity of cellular processes and the necessity to construct an optimized gene program in conditions reflective of the natural environment to allow for the creation of the optimal biological product. This requires a rigorous understanding of cell signaling pathways as well as the interactions that influence the expression of protein. This knowledge is captured in our advanced Cell Systems Informatics, which uses statistical modeling and other analytic frameworks to determine the most efficient pathways for an intended biochemical result, and also plays a critical role in our research and development as this database of information allows us to explore new targets of potential interest to our current or future collaborators. Moreover, our bioinformatics and computational modeling platform is central to our Protein Engineering, which focuses on designing enhanced and/or novel protein functionalities, including stability, localization, and catalytic activity.
In addition to creating optimized gene programs via the most efficient cell signaling pathways and in the relevant cellular environments, we have a growing library of genetic components with our UltraVector platform that enable design and assembly of gene programs which facilitate control over the quality, function, and performance of living cells. Our RheoSwitch inducible gene switch provides quantitative dose-proportionate regulation of the amount and timing of target protein expression, thereby providing another mechanism to closely control activity of a newly constructed gene program. Further, our AttSite Recombinases allow for stable, targeted gene integration and expression. Once cells have been engineered for the desired biological output, the LEAP automated platform can be used to identify and purify cells of interest, such as antibody expressing cells and stem cells. Furthermore, our ActoBiotics platform allows for targeted in situ expression of proteins and peptides from engineered microbes.

Our technology platform is designed to provide a "one stop shop" for start-to-finish conceptualization, engineering, regulation, optimization and production of biologically-based solutions that we believe possess many advantages over traditional processes. Our leading-edge toolkit can empower many different cell platforms allowing for selection of the most effective host to create a desired product or solution for our partners.
Our markets
Synthetic biology has applicability across many diverse end markets. Our goal is to be a leader in the application of synthetic biology for products currently utilizing biologically-based processes, and a leader in the replacement of conventional processes and products with biologically-based substitutes. Through the application of our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, we believe we can create optimized biological processes and create substitutes for traditional industrial techniques, leading to improved products that are developed and manufactured faster and more cost-effectively.
Health Sector
It is estimated that the global biopharmaceuticals market is over $160 billion. Additionally, the market for animal health therapeutics is currently estimated to be valued at more than $20 billion globally. The unreliable, costly discovery and development process for new medicines is being replaced by the engineering of biology at the genetic, molecular, and cellular level. Our ability to regulate complex gene programs and cellular systems by applying the principles of science, engineering, and computational bioinformatics with proprietary technologies is being utilized to design new therapies for humans and animals. We are applying our approach to develop targeted gene therapy applications and novel solutions within oncology, rare skin disorders, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ocular diseases, human infertility, infectious diseases, and animal health, as well as autoimmune, metabolic, and gastrointestinal disorders.
Food Sector
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations predicts that by 2050 the world's population will exceed 9 billion, global demand for animal protein will more than double, food production will need to increase by 70 percent, and global consumption of dairy and beef products will increase by 158 percent. We are focused on enabling efficient, high-quality food production that sustainably supports the necessities of our growing population. By applying our suite of technologies, we aim to facilitate development of agricultural, livestock and aquaculture resources that deliver innovative approaches and superior production yields in an environmentally responsible manner.
Energy Sector
Biological approaches hold significant potential to efficiently yield energy products. Despite this, existing attempts to produce "clean" energy are incredibly expensive, not achievable at an industrial scale, or require massive resources with low productivity. Additionally many alternative energy initiatives use food sources, like corn and sugarcane, which compete for arable land and water with sustenance crops. With our unique cellular engineering capabilities, we are developing microbial cell lines for bioconversion of methane to higher carbon content compounds. This proprietary platform holds the potential to transform the gas-to-liquids industry by generating valuable fuels and chemicals at a fraction of the cost of more traditional conversion methods. Our bioconversion approach seeks to attain the optimal balance of sustainable productive yield and attractive economic returns.
Environment Sector
As a result of industrialization and rapidly growing global populations, chemicals, heavy metals, oil products and various other pollutants are pervasive in the environment. These pollutants result in poor quality of drinking water, loss of water supply, contaminated ground water and soil, high clean-up costs, and potential health problems. We seek to engineer biological solutions that are designed to preserve or restore the environment and promote sustainability of natural resources. These biological approaches may replace products that present an environmental hazard. Examples include toxin-free, species-specific insect control methods that do not persist in the environment and microbial-based strategies for bioremediation of soil and water contamination.
Consumer Sector
Global consulting firm A.T. Kearney has estimated consumer spending will grow to $40 trillion by 2020 including an increase in spending on durable goods and personal care items. Despite its size and the number of products that can be achieved through biological means, the consumer market has experienced limited impact from synthetic biology. We are committed to partnering 
9

with diverse companies to develop biologically-based processes that displace petroleum-derived ingredients and polymers. Additionally, we are focused on reducing the wasteful practices associated with extracting compounds that occur in limiting amounts in plants and animals. Through our synthetic biology capabilities, we plan to utilize innovative biologically-based applications for the development of products, such as personal care items and decorative arts, to improve the lives of consumers every day.
Our business model
We believe that because synthetic biology has applicability across many diverse end markets, we cannot take full advantage of synthetic biology with internal development programs alone. To address this, we have devised our business model to allow us to focus on our core expertise in synthetic biology while bringing many different commercial products to market via collaborations in a broad range of industries or end markets, thus minimizing and leveraging the use of our own capital.
Our business model is built primarily around the formation of ECCs. An ECC is an agreement with a collaborator to develop products based on our technologies in a specifically defined field. We seek collaborators that have expertise within a specific industry sector and the commitment to provide resources for the commercialization of products within that industry sector. In our ECCs, we provide expertise in the engineering of gene programs and cellular systems, and our collaborators are responsible for providing market and product development expertise, as well as sales and marketing capabilities.
This business model allows us to leverage our capabilities and capital across numerous product development programs and a broader landscape of end markets than we would be capable of addressing on our own. Our ECC business model also allows us to participate in the potential upside from products that are enabled by our technologies across an extensive range of industries, without the need for us to invest considerable resources in bringing individual products to market. Additionally, the flexibility of the business model allows us to collaborate with a range of counterparts, from small innovative companies to global multinational conglomerates.
Alternatively, we may execute a research collaboration to develop an early-stage program pursuant to which we receive reimbursement for our development costs but the exclusive commercial rights, and related access fees, are deferred until completion of an initial research program.
In certain strategic circumstances, we may enter into a JV with a third party collaborator whereby we may contribute access to our technology, cash or both into the JV which we will jointly control with our collaborator. Pursuant to a JV agreement, we may be required to contribute additional capital to the JV, and we may be able to receive a higher financial return than we would normally receive from an ECC to the extent that we and our collaborator are successful in developing one or more products. 
As we consider the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology technologies, we have identified a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of such technology. We believe that the strategic acquisition of certain such companies will allow us to develop and commercialize innovative products and create significant value for Intrexon. Our business model therefore includes the acquisition of certain product-focused companies that may leverage our technologies and expertise in order to expand their respective product applications.
As a means to further the development of our business model, in June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Harvest Intrexon Enterprise Fund I, LP, or Harvest, an investment fund sponsored by Harvest Capital Strategies, LLC, and a related party based on ownership in the fund by affiliates of Third Security, LLC, or Third Security. Harvest was established to invest in life science research and development opportunities that we offer to Harvest. These are investment proposals that are suitable for pursuit by a start-up venture, characterized by the agreement as "start-up opportunities." For such start-up opportunities, we provide Harvest with exclusive rights of first-look and first negotiation. For any opportunities it decides to pursue, Harvest establishes new collaboration entities which enter into an ECC with us in a designated field. The terms of such ECCs are negotiated between us and Harvest. In addition, the agreement provides us the right to present to Harvest the opportunity to invest in other ventures, including investment opportunities with respect to our existing collaborations. Any such opportunities are presented at our discretion on a non-exclusive basis. The agreement with Harvest does not limit our ability to execute other collaborations and JVs with third parties. As consideration for providing exclusive rights of first-look and first negotiation for start-up opportunities, we receive a portion of the management fee collected by the fund sponsor of Harvest.
Our ECCs
Our ECCs typically share a number of key features. Each ECC is an agreement with a collaborator to develop products based on our technologies in one or more specifically defined fields. These fields may be narrowly defined (representing, for 
10

example, a specific therapeutic approach for a single indication) or may be broad (representing, for example, an entire class of related products). In each case, we and the collaborator precisely define the field based on factors such as the expertise of the collaborator, the relative markets for the prospective products, the collaborator's resources available to commit to the ECC and our expectations as to other prospective ECCs in related areas. Regardless of the size of the field, under each ECC we grant the collaborator exclusive rights to our services and our suite of technologies to commercialize products within the field. So long as our collaboration continues, the parties agree that each will not, alone or with another party, develop and commercialize products within the field of the ECC. 
We may realize four general categories of revenue under our ECCs: (i) technology access fees upon signing; (ii) reimbursements of costs incurred by us for our research and development and/or manufacturing efforts related to specific applications provided for in the collaboration; (iii) milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial activities; and (iv) royalties on sales of products arising from the collaboration.
Pursuant to our business model, we may receive equity in lieu of cash for technology access fees and milestones and also may participate in capital raises to allow earlier-stage collaborators to focus their resources on product development. When such a collaborator develops greater operational or financial resources, however, its shares become a financial asset within Intrexon that is independent of our operational or collaborative purposes. 
Generally, each of our ECCs is designed to continue in perpetuity unless terminated. Given the relatively long development cycle for many of the products that could be enabled by our technologies, as well as our belief that we can enable the continual improvement of product offerings, it is our expectation that our ECCs will continue for many years and result in the development of multiple products. Each of our collaborators, however, retains the right to terminate the ECC for any reason by providing us written notice a certain period of time prior to such termination, generally ninety days. The ECC is also terminable by either party upon the other party's breach of material provisions of the ECC. The failure of our collaborator to exercise diligent efforts to develop products within the field of the ECC constitutes such a breach.
In the event one of our ECCs terminates, we are entitled to immediately pursue a collaboration with a different counterparty within the field of the terminated ECC. Moreover, technologies and product candidates in a relatively early stage of development revert to us, along with data, materials and the rights to applicable regulatory filings related to the reverted products, enabling us to develop those product candidates ourselves or incorporate them into a future collaboration. Product candidates that are at a more advanced stage of development, such as those already generating revenue or being considered for approval by an applicable regulatory body at the time of the ECC's termination are retained by the former collaborator. The collaborator has the right to commercialize such retained products although we are entitled to the royalties or other compensation to which we would be entitled as if the ECC were still in effect. Upon termination, we generally retain any technology access fees or other payments to which we are entitled through the date of termination.
In our ECCs, we retain rights to our existing intellectual property and generally any intellectual property developed using, or otherwise incorporating, our technologies. In addition, we are generally responsible for controlling the prosecution and enforcement of this intellectual property with the exception of the enforcement of patents directed solely and specifically to products developed within the field of each ECC.
Each of our ECCs requires the collaborator to indemnify us for all liability related to products produced pursuant to the ECC and to obtain insurance coverage related to product liability.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the key financial terms of our significant ECCs.

In December 2015, we and certain investors, or the IEPII Investors, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement which governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon Energy Partners II, LLC, or Intrexon Energy Partners II, a JV formed to utilize our natural gas bioconversion platform for the production of 1,4-butanediol, an industrial chemical intermediate used to manufacture spandex, polyurethane, plastics, and polyester. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon Energy Partners II providing exclusive rights to our technology for use in the field, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $18 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon Energy Partners II. The IEPII Investors made initial capital contributions, totaling $18 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners II totaling 50 percent. In December 2015, the owners of Intrexon Energy Partners II made a capital contribution of $4 million, half of which was paid by us. We committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $10 million, and the IEPII Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners II, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $10 million, at the request of the 
12

Intrexon Energy Partners II's board of managers, or the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon Energy Partners II is governed by the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board which has five members. One member of the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board is designated by us and four members are designated by a majority of the IEPII Investors. We and the IEPII Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above the initial limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board.
EnviroFlight
In February 2016, we entered into a series of transactions involving EnviroFlight, LLC, or Old EnviroFlight, Darling Ingredients Inc., or Darling, and a newly formed venture between us and Darling, or New EnviroFlight. This series of integrated transactions resulted in us acquiring substantially all of the assets of Old EnviroFlight and contemporaneously contributing all of these assets, with the exception of certain developed technology, and $3 million of cash to New EnviroFlight in exchange for a non-controlling, 50 percent membership interest in New EnviroFlight. Our contributions to New EnviroFlight included an exclusive license to the developed technology that was retained by us. Darling received the remaining 50 percent membership interest in New EnviroFlight as consideration for terminating rights previously held in the developed technology with Old EnviroFlight. New EnviroFlight was formed to generate high nutrition, low environmental impact animal and fish feed, as well as fertilizer products. We and Darling as members have each agreed to make additional capital contributions of up to $5 million to fund ongoing operations of New EnviroFlight. All of the employees of Old EnviroFlight became employees of New EnviroFlight.
Intrexon T1D Partners
In March 2016, we and certain investors, the T1D Investors, including affiliates of Third Security, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement which governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon T1D Partners, LLC, or the Intrexon T1D Partners, a JV formed to utilize our proprietary ActoBiotics platform to develop and commercialize products to treat type 1 diabetes. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon T1D Partners which provides the exclusive rights to our technology for use in the field, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $10 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon T1D Partners. The T1D Investors made initial capital contributions, totaling $10 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon T1D Partners totaling 50 percent. We committed to make capital contributions of up to $5 million, and the T1D Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon T1D Partners, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $5 million, at the request of Intrexon T1D Partners' board of managers, or the Intrexon T1D Partners Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon T1D Partners is governed by the Intrexon T1D Partners Board, which has five members. Two members of the Intrexon T1D Partners Board are designated by us and three members are designated by a majority of the T1D Investors. We and the T1D Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above these limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon T1D Partners Board.
See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of significant ECCs between us and our JVs.

AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., or AquaBounty, of which we own approximately 70 percent as of December 31, 2016, is focusing on improving productivity in commercial aquaculture, including the development of the AquAdvantage® Salmon, or AAS, an Atlantic salmon that has been genetically enhanced to reach market size in less time than conventionally farmed Atlantic salmon and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In January 2017, we invested $25 million in AquaBounty through an equity purchase and subsequently, we distributed 1,776,557 of our AquaBounty shares to our shareholders, decreasing our ownership to approximately 58 percent.
Mergers, acquisitions, and technology in-licensing
We may augment our suite of proprietary technologies through mergers or acquisitions of technologies which then become available to new or existing collaborators. Among other things, we pursue technologies that we believe will be generally complementary to our existing technologies and also meet our desired return on investment and other economic criteria. In certain cases, such technologies may already be applied in the production of products or services and in these cases we may seek to expand the breadth or efficacy of such products or services through the use of our technologies. In 2016, we acquired all of the assets of Old EnviroFlight, as described above and also in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GenVec acquisition
In January 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GenVec, Inc., or GenVec, a clinical-stage company and pioneer in the development of AdenoVerse™ gene delivery technology. Upon closing of the transaction, GenVec stockholders will receive 0.297 of a share of our common stock in exchange for each share of GenVec common stock. This exchange ratio represents $7.00 per share of GenVec's common stock divided by our five-day volume weighted average price as of January 23, 2017. GenVec stockholders may also receive contingent consideration equal to 50 percent of any milestone or royalty payments received under one of GenVec's collaboration agreements, provided such payments are received within three years after the closing of the transaction.  Consummation of the transaction, anticipated in the second quarter of 2017, is subject to customary closing conditions, including GenVec stockholder approval.
Competition
We believe that we are a leader in synthetic biology. We do not believe that we have any direct competitors who provide similar technologies which fully enable the commercialization of products developed using synthetic biology across a broad spectrum of biologically based industries. As a result, we believe our competition is more indirect and general in nature, and falls into three broad categories:

• | Synthetic biology service providers. There are companies that have competing technologies for individual pieces of our suite of complementary technologies. For example, there are companies that can synthesize DNA, and there are companies that can develop monoclonal antibodies. One portion of our proprietary technology related to DNA synthesis and assembly includes the ability to de novo synthesize DNA. We believe the following companies engage in the manufacture of DNA componentry: ATUM, Inc., Blue Heron Biotech, LLC (a subsidiary of OriGene), Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), Gen9, Inc., GenScript USA, Inc., and Life Technologies Corporation, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.


• | Industrial companies who may develop their own approach to synthetic biology. Rather than becoming a collaborator with us, potential collaborators may decide to invest time and capital to internally develop their own synthetic biology capabilities. For example, large biopharmaceutical companies, energy companies, and ag-bio companies may pursue a proprietary synthetic biology strategy.

14


• | Industrial companies who may develop competing products using other technologies. Products enabled by our synthetic biology will face competition in the market, including from products which have been developed using other industrial technologies. For example, large biopharmaceutical companies pursue other technologies for drug development, and large ag-bio companies pursue other technologies for the development of genetically modified crops. The rapidly evolving market for developing genetically engineered T-cells in particular, a primary focus of our collaboration with ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc., or ZIOPHARM, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Genetically engineering T-cells faces significant competition in the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology space from multiple companies and their collaborators, such as Novartis/University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird Bio/Celgene/Baylor College of Medicine/Five Prime/KitePharma/ViroMed Laboratories, Kite Pharma/National Cancer Institute, Juno Therapeutics/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center/Seattle Children's Research Institute, Cellectis/Pfizer/Servier, Adaptimmune/GSK and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals. We face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by other companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

Intellectual property
As we advance technologies across multiple platforms and synthetic biology areas, correspondingly, we apply a multilayered approach for protecting intellectual property relating to the inventions we have developed internally as well as those we have acquired from third parties, such as by assignment or by in-license. We seek patent protection in the United States and in other countries for our inventions and discoveries, and we develop and protect our key know-how and trade secrets relating to our platform technologies as well as to the products we are developing with our collaborators.
We seek patent protection for our platform technologies, including but not limited to our (i) switch technology; (ii) activator ligands for our switch technology; (iii) portfolio around various genetic componentry such as vectors, cells and organisms containing these genetic componentry; and (iv) cell identification and selection platform. In addition, we seek patents covering specific collaborator's products. With respect to a particular collaborator's product, we may seek patent protection on some or all of the following aspects of the invention such as: the compound or material composition of matter and/or the method or process of making or using the composition.
Through the use of our various platform technologies we seek to design and build proprietary compounds, vectors, methods and processes across a variety of end markets. In particular, we focus our intellectual property on synthetic biology technologies that provide platforms for the design and creation of cells, vectors and components for our collaborators. In addition, we may pursue intermediate and product-specific patents associated with our collaborators' lead programs.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property relating to our technologies and products and potential products. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in other jurisdictions globally as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes. For instance, where we believe appropriate, we have also filed counterpart patents and patent applications in other countries, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. In the future we may file in these or additional jurisdictions as deemed appropriate for the protection of our technologies.
As of December 31, 2016, we owned at least 55 issued U.S. patents and 55 pending U.S. patent applications relating to certain aspects of our technologies, and we have pursued counterpart patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions around the world, as we have deemed appropriate. We continue to actively develop our portfolio through the filing of new patent applications, provisional and continuations or divisionals relating to our technologies, methods and products as we and our collaborators deem appropriate.
We have strategic positioning with respect to our key technologies including our owned patent portfolios directed to: our switch technology covering aspects of our switches and gene modulation systems, with a last to expire patent currently in 2029; our portfolio around various genetic componentry, such as vectors, cells and organisms containing these genetic componentry, and their use, with a last to expire patent in 2032; our activator ligand technology covering aspects of our activator ligands and their use, with a last to expire patent in 2034; and our cell identification and selection technology covering aspects of our cell identification and selection platform, including our cell purification, isolation, characterization and manipulation technologies, with a last to expire patent in 2031. Although we cannot be assured that these patents may not be subject to challenge in the future, as of this filing, there are currently no material contested proceedings and/or third party claims with respect to any of these patent portfolios.
15

Additionally, we complement our intellectual property portfolio with exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and options for licenses to third party technologies.
A principal component of our strategy is maximizing the value of our ECCs through our intellectual property that covers our technologies, which is accentuated by intermediate and program-specific intellectual property protections. In addition to owned and in-licensed patents, we solidify our intellectual property protection through a combination of trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information related to each platform and collaborator program. We regularly assess and review the risks and benefits of protecting our developments through each aspect of intellectual property available to us.
Because we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to protect various aspects of our core technology, we require our employees, consultants and scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with us to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our confidentiality agreements generally provide that the employee, consultant or scientific collaborator will not disclose our confidential information to third parties. These agreements also provide that inventions conceived by the employee, consultant or scientific collaborator in the course of working for us will be our exclusive property. Additionally, our employees agree to take certain steps to facilitate our assertion of ownership over such intellectual property. These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technologies, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have. In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
Regulatory environment
Regulations affecting Intrexon
Our ongoing research and development relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional regulations. As described below, our research operations are also subject to various environmental regulations. However, while most of the current laws and regulations concerning synthetic biology relate to the end products produced using synthetic biology, this may change. For example, in December 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the federal government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the federal government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms. 
As discussed below, the products our collaborators produce are subject to extensive regulation. Refer to "Risk factors — The markets in which our collaborators are developing products using our technologies are subject to extensive regulation, and we rely on our collaborators to comply with all applicable laws and regulations" for more discussion of regulatory risks.
Environmental regulations affecting Intrexon, our subsidiaries and our collaborators
Our collaborators, our subsidiaries and we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of employees with respect to laboratory activities required for the development of products and technologies. These laws and regulations require us and our collaborators to obtain environmental permits and comply with numerous environmental restrictions. These laws and regulations also may require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment.
Our laboratory activities and those of our collaborators inherently involve the use of potentially hazardous materials, which are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations. We design our infrastructure, procedures and equipment to meet our obligations under these regulations. We perform recurring internal and third-party audits and provide employees ongoing training and support, as required. All of our employees must comply with safety instructions and procedures, which are codified in our employment policies. Federal and state laws and regulations impose requirements on the production, importation, use and disposal of chemicals and genetically modified microorganisms, which impact us and our collaborators. Our subsidiaries' and our collaborators' processes may contain genetically engineered organisms which, when used in industrial processes, are considered new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. These laws and regulations would require our subsidiaries and collaborators to obtain and comply with the EPA's Microbial Commercial Activity Notice process to operate. In the European Union, our subsidiaries and collaborators may be subject to a chemical regulatory program known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of 
16

Chemical Substances). Under REACH, companies are required to register their products with the European Commission, and the registration process could result in significant costs or delay the manufacture or sale of products in the European Union.
Regulations affecting our collaborators and subsidiaries
Human therapeutics regulation
As discussed in "Risk factors — Risks associated with our business model," the products produced by our collaborators enabled by our technology platforms are subject to extensive regulation. We rely on our collaborators' compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the products they produce. We do not independently monitor whether our collaborators comply with applicable laws and regulations. Please see the risk factor entitled "The markets in which our collaborators are developing products using our technologies are subject to extensive regulation, and we rely on our collaborators to comply with all applicable laws and regulations."
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by our collaborators. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In addition to regulations in the United States, our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of the products enabled by our technologies. Whether or not our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, they must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before they may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Animal health regulation
The sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country. In the majority of our target markets, the relevant health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products. In the United States, the FDA regulates animal health pharmaceuticals, the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, regulates veterinary vaccines, and EPA regulates veterinary pesticides. Each U.S. agency has its own rules and regulations with which our collaborators must comply. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines, including animal health products being developed by our collaborators with our technology platforms. Most other countries' regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union and other international animal health entities.
Oxitec has produced a genetically engineered line of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (OX513A) with the intent of suppressing the population of that mosquito at the release site(s). Oxitec's genetically engineered insect products are subject to regulation. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine is currently the lead regulatory body, working in association with EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has reviewed information supplied by Oxitec in an Investigational New Animal Drug, or INAD, regarding the company's genetically engineered mosquitoes. As part of the review, the FDA published in August 2016 a final environmental assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) regarding impacts on human health, animal health and the environment based on their review of information and evidence provided on the conduct of an investigational trial in Key Haven, Florida. In November 2016, the Board of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) voted to approve the use of the OX513A mosquitoes in an effectiveness trial. FKMCD and Oxitec are currently working together to identify possible sites for this trial. We do not currently have a timeline for when the trial will occur. The OX513A genetically engineered mosquito has been approved by Brazil's National Biosafety Committee (CTNBio) for unrestricted releases throughout the country, and open field trials of these mosquitoes have been conducted in Brazil, the Cayman Islands, Panama, and Malaysia under relevant permits or approvals. Further approvals will be required for commercial production and use.
Food product regulation
The manufacturing, marketing and certain areas of research related to some of the potential food products developed by our subsidiaries and collaborators are subject to regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, the USDA, and the EPA. The FDA regulates genetically engineered animals under new animal drug 
17

provisions of the law, and the agency must approve them before they are allowed on the market. Following marketing approval, the FDA continues to regulate drug and biological products extensively.
Okanagan's Arctic apple products are subject to such regulation. In February 2015, the USDA announced its decision to deregulate Okanagan's Golden Delicious apple variety and Granny Smith apple variety, or together the Arctic apples. In reaching its decision, the USDA conducted a final plant pest risk assessment, or PPRA, concluding that Arctic apples are unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture and other plants in the United States. The USDA also completed an EA to comply with the National Environment Policy Act, or NEPA, and concluded that deregulation is not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment. Concurrent with the USDA, Okanagan also engaged in a voluntary food safety assessment consultation with the FDA regarding its Arctic apples. The FDA completed its assessment in March 2015. Based on the information provided by Okanagan and other information available to the agency, the FDA did not identify any safety or regulatory issues under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act that would require further evaluation. As part of bringing the assessment to closure, Okanagan was required to submit summaries of its safety and nutritional assessments for its Arctic apples. In August 2016, the USDA announced its decision to extend a preliminary determination of nonregulated status to Okanagan's Arctic Fuji apple variety
Comparable authorities to the federal and state governmental authorities in the United States are involved in other countries, such as the European Food Safety Authority, or EFSA, in Europe and Health Canada in Canada. In relation to Okanagan, Health Canada announced its decision in March 2015 that it has no objection to the food use of the Arctic apple in Canada. In reaching its decision, Health Canada conducted a comprehensive assessment of the Golden Delicious and Granny Smith varieties according to its Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Novel Foods. These guidelines are consent with internationally accepted principles for establishing the safety of foods with novel traits adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Following this assessment, it was determined that the changes made to the Arctic apple did not pose a greater risk to human health than apples currently available on the Canadian market. In addition, Health Canada also concluded that the Arctic apple would have no impact on allergies and that there are no differences in the nutritional value of the Arctic apple compared to other traditional apple varieties available for consumption.
AquaBounty's AAS is also subject to such regulation. The FDA published in December 2012 an EA for AAS along with its FONSI in the Federal Register, confirming that an approval of the pending New Animal Drug Application would not have an adverse effect on the environment and opened up a 60 day period for public comment. In February 2013, the FDA extended the period for public comment by an additional 60 days, which expired in April 2013. Prior to the publication of the EA and FONSI, in September 2010, the FDA held a public meeting of its Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee to review its findings regarding AAS. The conclusion of its panel of experts was that AAS is indistinguishable from other farmed Atlantic salmon, is safe to eat and does not pose a threat to the environment under its conditions of use. Subsequently, the FDA initiated an EA in compliance with its obligations under the U.S. NEPA, which requires that all federal agencies consider the possible environmental impacts of any action that they authorize. Subsequently, in November 2015, the FDA approved the New Animal Drug Application for the production, sale and consumption of AAS. AquaBounty is subject to on-going post approval responsibilities as detailed in the FDA letter of approval and summarized in the EA dated in November 2015. In the event that AquaBounty seeks to modify or expand its production sites and methods, the company may require further regulatory approvals. In May 2016, Health Canada concluded its review of AAS and approved it for commercial sale in Canada and the Animal Feed Division of the Animal Health Directorate of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), authorized AAS for use in livestock feeds. 
Energy and chemical regulation
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of biofuels. The biofuels developed by our collaborators with our technology platforms may require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In the United States, various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, storage and use of biofuels. The environmental regulations discussed above also govern the development, manufacture and marketing of energy and chemical products.
Research and development
As of December 31, 2016, we had 446 research and development employees. We incurred expenses of $112.1 million, $147.5 million and $59.0 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, on research and development activities. We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase substantially as we investigate other applications for our synthetic biotechnologies. Our primary domestic research and development operations are located in laboratory facilities in Germantown, Maryland; South San Francisco, California; Davis, California; and San Diego, California; and our primary 
18

international research and development operations are located in laboratory facilities in Budapest, Hungary; Oxford, England; Ghent, Belgium; and Campinas, Brazil.
