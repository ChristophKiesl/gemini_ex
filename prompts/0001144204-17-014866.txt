ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
 
Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class biological therapies for the treatment of cardiac and other medical conditions.
 
We were originally incorporated in Delaware in August 2005 under the name Nile Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and we changed our name to Nile Therapeutics, Inc., or Nile, in January 2007. On November 20, 2013, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 7, 2013, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of September 27, 2013, or as amended, the Merger Agreement, by and among Nile, Nile’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bovet Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation, or Merger Sub, and Capricor, Inc., or Capricor, a Delaware corporation, Merger Sub merged with and into Capricor and Capricor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nile (referred to herein as the Merger). Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and in connection therewith, Nile filed certain amendments to its certificate of incorporation which, among other things, (i) effected a 1-for-50 reverse split of its common stock, (ii) changed its corporate name from “Nile Therapeutics, Inc.” to “Capricor Therapeutics, Inc.,” and (iii) effected a reduction in the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 50,000,000, and a reduction in the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock from 10,000,000 to 5,000,000.
 
Capricor, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was founded in 2005 as a Delaware corporation based on the innovative work of its founder, Eduardo Marbán, M.D., Ph.D., and his collaborators. First located in Baltimore, Maryland, adjacent to The Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, where Dr. Marbán was chief of cardiology, Capricor moved to Los Angeles, California in 2007 when Dr. Marbán became Director of the Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, or CSMC. Capricor’s laboratories are located in space that Capricor leases from CSMC.
 
Our Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize first-in-class biological therapies for the treatment of cardiac and other medical conditions. Our drug candidates in active development consist of CAP-1002 (allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells, or CDCs) and CAP-2003 (CDC exosomes).
 
We are developing CAP-1002 for the treatment of certain conditions that result from damage to the heart muscle. We have conducted the DYNAMIC trial, a Phase I clinical trial of CAP-1002 in subjects with advanced heart failure, and we are currently conducting the ALLSTAR trial, a Phase II clinical trial of CAP-1002 in subjects who have suffered a myocardial infarction, or MI, which is commonly known as a heart attack. We are also currently conducting the HOPE trial, a Phase I/II clinical trial of CAP-1002 in subjects with heart disease associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD.
 
We are developing CAP-2003 for the treatment of certain cardiac and inflammatory conditions. CAP-2003 is currently in pre-clinical development and we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in the second half of 2017.
 
These programs represent our core technology and products.
 
Background on Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
 
Heart Disease
 
Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and in the world. According to the American Heart Association, an estimated 85 million people in the U.S. have some form of heart disease, representing over $207 billion in direct and indirect costs annually. Despite the availability of a variety of medical and surgical options by which many types of heart disease and the oft-associated adverse neurohormonal response may be managed, including medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin modulators, and aldosterone receptor antagonists and including implanted devices such as coronary stents, implanted pacemakers, resynchronization therapy and cardioverter-defibrillators, their collective ability to adequately address the heart disease population is limited by their degrees and durabilities of benefit as well as their tolerabilities and other risks. None of these interventions have reliably been shown to correct the underlying disease process, an important deficiency given the progressive nature of many types of heart disease. Mechanical circulatory support, and for selected patients, heart transplantation, may ultimately be necessary in those cases in which the utility of more conservative options is no longer sufficient.

The most common form of heart disease is coronary heart disease, characterized by a buildup of plaque inside the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart. Plaque consists of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. The plaque can eventually burst, tear or rupture, creating a “snag” where a blood clot forms and blocks blood flow in the artery, depriving part of the heart of oxygen and nutrients. If the flow of blood is not restored within a few minutes, heart muscle cells in the area of the blocked artery will die. This acute event is known as a myocardial infarction, the medical term for a heart attack. The area of infarct is eventually replaced by a permanent and non-contractile collagen scar that can adversely impact heart function. The size of the resulting scar has been shown to correlate with the pump function of the heart, with larger scars predicting worse outcomes. Despite best available therapy, patients who suffer an MI often continue to experience degeneration or weakening of their heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure and a shortened lifespan.
 
According to the American Heart Association, coronary heart disease afflicts over 15 million people in the U.S. and causes nearly 50% of heart disease deaths. In 2010, coronary heart disease was responsible for 1.3 million hospital stays. In 2011, heart attacks and coronary heart disease were two of the ten most expensive causes of hospitalization. Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of MI, which strikes approximately 750,000 Americans each year, often leading to repeated hospitalizations, a decrease in quality of life, and premature death. More than seven million people in the U.S. have had a heart attack.
 
Heart Failure & Dilated Cardiomyopathy
 
Heart failure, or HF, is a progressive condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. When the heart does not circulate blood adequately, the kidneys receive less blood and filter less fluid out of the circulation into the urine. The extra fluid in the circulation may build up in the lungs, the liver and in the legs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, progressive tiredness, and leg swelling, and can make everyday activities more difficult or impossible.
 
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure and is primarily characterized by the enlargement and weakening of the heart’s left ventricle, its main pumping chamber. The left ventricle becomes enlarged, or dilated, and cannot pump blood to the body with as much force as a healthy heart. Conditions such as coronary heart disease and MI, as well as viral infections, can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. While many people with dilated cardiomyopathy have minor or no symptoms, other people develop symptoms that may progress and worsen as heart failure worsens.
 
According to the American Heart Association, heart failure affects over five million Americans and is the fastest-growing clinical cardiac condition in the United States. The number of U.S. adults with heart failure is expected to increase to approximately eight million by 2030. Heart failure is responsible for over one million hospital admissions each year in the U.S. and generates annual inpatient costs of more than $20 billion. Among patients older than 65 years, heart failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization. Of those patients who have been admitted, approximately 24% are re-hospitalized in one month and approximately 50% are re-hospitalized in six months.
 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 
DMD is a rare form of muscular dystrophy which results in muscle degeneration and premature death. DMD affects approximately 1 in 3,600 male infants worldwide, and it is estimated that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 boys and young men are living with the disease in the U.S. DMD results from the lack of functional dystrophin protein caused by a gene mutation. The lack of dystrophin, an important structural component of muscle cells, causes them to have increased susceptibility to damage and to progressively die. Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle weakness starting at an early age, loss of ambulation in the first decade of life, and eventual respiratory and cardiac failure. Their lifespan is abbreviated and averages less than three decades.
 
In DMD patients, heart muscle cells progressively die and are replaced with scar tissue. This cardiomyopathy eventually leads to heart failure, which is currently the leading cause of death among those with DMD. There are no therapies that are currently approved to treat cardiomyopathy secondary to DMD.

Our Technology
 
Our core therapeutic technology is based on the cardiosphere-derived cell, or CDC, a type of cardiac progenitor cell that composes a minor fraction of the cardiac muscle cell population and was first identified in the academic laboratory of Capricor’s scientific founder, Dr. Eduardo Marbán. Since their initial report in 2007, CDCs have been the subject of over 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and have been administered to approximately 140 human subjects across several clinical trials. We are currently developing allogeneic CDCs (CAP-1002) as a product candidate for the treatment of cardiac disorders as well as exosomes produced by CDCs (CAP-2003) as a product candidate for the treatment of certain cardiac and inflammatory conditions.
 
Cardiosphere-Derived Cells
 
Preclinical and clinical data support the therapeutic concept of administering CDCs as a means to address conditions in which the heart muscle has been damaged. Although CDCs that are naturally present in the heart may serve to facilitate the repair of minor injury to the heart muscle as may occur in the course of daily living, for example as a result of intensive exercise, they may be insufficient to counteract catastrophic injury, such as that which occurs in a myocardial infarction, or chronic injury, such as that which occurs in heart failure or in DMD.
 
In a variety of experimental models of heart injury, CDCs have been shown to stimulate cell proliferation and blood vessel growth, to inhibit programmed cell death and scar formation, and to attract native progenitor cells to the site of injury.
 
In the CADUCEUS trial, a randomized clinical trial sponsored by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in collaboration with The Johns Hopkins University and conducted in 25 patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, a single infusion of autologous CDCs (i.e., CDCs derived from the patient’s own heart tissue) into the coronary artery associated with the infarcted region, compared to standard-of-care controls, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in scar mass and increase viable muscle mass, as assessed by blinded cardiac MRI analysis at six and 12 months of follow-up. This trial was funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, or the NHLBI, Specialized Centers for Cell-Based Therapy.
 
In the DYNAMIC trial, an open-label, single administration, ascending dose clinical trial conducted in 14 patients with New York Heart Association, or NYHA, Class III heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy in which CAP-1002 (allogeneic CDCs, or CDCs derived from donor heart tissue) was infused into each of the three major coronary arteries, a pooled-dose analysis showed that measures of functional status and capacity, cardiac function and dimension, and quality-of-life broadly showed trends of improvement from baseline at six and 12 months of follow-up. These results included the findings of statistically-significant improvements in NYHA Class, left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score at six months. The level of significance for LVEF improvement was maintained at 12 months.
 
CDCs are derived from cardiospheres, or CSps, which are self-assembling multicellular clusters which contain both primitive cells and committed progenitors for the three major cell types present in the heart. Although CSps have been demonstrated to possess regenerative properties in pre-clinical studies, their relatively large size makes them less suitable than CDCs for delivery into the coronary arteries due to the risk of intra-arterial obstruction. CDCs are sufficiently small that, within acceptable dose limits, they can be infused into a coronary artery. Capricor has performed clinical studies to establish the range of CDC dose levels that appear to be safe to deliver to the heart.
 
While CSps and their respective CDCs may originate from either a deceased human donor (allogeneic source) or from heart tissue taken directly from recipient patients themselves (autologous source), the methods for manufacturing CDCs from either source are similar.
 
Capricor’s proprietary methods are focused on producing therapeutic doses of CDCs to boost the regenerative capacity of the heart, with the goal of improving cardiac function. Capricor has exclusively licensed intellectual property covering CDCs and CSps from three academic institutions and is also pursuing its own intellectual property rights relating to these product candidates.
 
Cardiosphere-Derived Cell Exosomes
 
Exosomes are nano-sized, membrane-enclosed vesicles, or “bubbles” that are secreted by essentially all cells and contain bioactive molecules, including proteins, RNAs and microRNAs. They act as messengers to regulate the functions of neighboring cells, and pre-clinical research has shown that exogenously-administered exosomes can direct or, in some cases, re-direct cellular activity, thereby supporting their therapeutic potential. Their size, ease of crossing cell membranes, and ability to communicate in native cellular language makes them an exciting, emerging class of potential therapeutic agents. Exosomes are a cell-free substance and may be stored, handled, reconstituted, and administered in similar fashion to common biopharmaceutical products such as antibodies.

Exosomes secreted by CDCs, or CDC exosomes, are capable of producing the effects observed with CDCs themselves, including anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic effects. In pre-clinical models of ischemic heart disease, CDC exosomes prompt myocardial regeneration as well as various structural and functional improvements within the heart. These findings suggest that CDC exosomes may serve as a critical mediator of the actions of CDCs, and support the concept of their development as a therapeutic agent.
 
Our Product Candidates
 
We have four drug candidates, two of which are in various stages of active development. Our current research and development efforts are focused on CAP-1002 and CAP-2003. CAP-1002 is the subject of two ongoing clinical trials, and we expect to enter CAP-2003 into clinical development in the second half of 2017. CAP-1001 (autologous CDCs) was the subject of the CSMC and JHU-sponsored Phase I CADUCEUS trial and is not in active development. Both CAP-1002 and CAP-1001 are derived from CSps, and we do not plan to develop CSps as a therapeutic.

*Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with Capricor, pursuant to which, if exercised, Janssen would receive a worldwide, exclusive license to exploit CAP-1002 as well as certain allogeneic CDCs in the field of cardiology, except as may otherwise be agreed with respect to certain indications to be determined.
 
** FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation to CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD.
 
CAP-1002: 
 
We are currently conducting two clinical trials of our lead product candidate, CAP-1002: the Phase II portion of the Phase I/II ALLSTAR trial in patients who have had an MI, and the Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne trial in patients with DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. We have completed the Phase I portion of the Phase I/II DYNAMIC trial in patients with advanced heart failure.
 
Phase I/II ALLSTAR Clinical Trial
 
The Phase I portion of the ALLSTAR trial was a 14-patient, open-label, dose-escalation study that was conducted to evaluate the clinical safety of CAP-1002. Each patient received a single infusion of CAP-1002 into the coronary artery most closely associated with the location of their MI, at a dose level of either 12.5 million or 25 million cells. The primary safety endpoints focused on the potential adverse effects of CAP-1002 delivery, including potential immunologic consequences of infusing cells that had originated from an unrelated donor. Enrollment was completed in October 2013. Event rates observed for each of the four pre-specified safety endpoints (acute myocarditis possibly attributable to CAP-1002; death due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation; sudden death; and major adverse cardiac events) were 0% over one and 12 months following CAP-1002 infusion.

Updated preliminary 12-month magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, data revealed that those Phase I patients who would have been eligible for randomization into the Phase II clinical study by virtue of dose and tissue type compatibility exhibited a reduction in infarct, or scar, size of 15% from baseline. These data also indicated a 4% improvement from baseline in ejection fraction, a global measure of the heart's pumping ability. Measurements of viable mass and regional function also showed quantifiable improvements. This Phase I study was funded in large part by a grant received from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.
 
In December 2013, the Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board of the NHLBI notified Capricor that it had had met its safety endpoints and that Capricor was cleared to begin the Phase II portion of the ALLSTAR trial.
 
Capricor began enrollment of the Phase II ALLSTAR study in the first quarter of 2014. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to determine if treatment with CAP-1002 can reduce scar size in patients who have suffered an MI. At the time of randomization, patients were stratified into one of two cohorts according to the time since the occurrence of their MI (either 30 to 90 days after the MI, or greater than 90 days up to one-year after the MI). Following infusion, patients are to be followed for periodic evaluations over the course of one year. As such, CAP-1002 is being evaluated in the setting of both acute MI, in which the scar has recently formed, and chronic MI, in which the scar is more established. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive an infusion of CAP-1002 (25 million cells) or placebo, respectively, into the coronary artery most closely associated with the region of their MI. The trial is powered to detect a reduction in scar size, relative to placebo, as measured by MRI at the 12-month follow-up. In addition to evaluating CAP-1002 according to changes in scar size, ALLSTAR will also evaluate CAP-1002 according to a variety of clinical and quality of life endpoints. The Phase II portion of the ALLSTAR trial is being funded in large part through the support of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM.
 
Based on information available to us at the start of enrollment into the Phase II ALLSTAR trial, we initially designed this study to enroll up to 300 patients. Following the completion of statistical modeling of the design of ALLSTAR which incorporated the expanded dataset that had become available from other clinical trials of our CDCs, we elected to decrease the enrollment goal of ALLSTAR to approximately 120 patients, a sample size that is expected to maintain sufficient statistical power to detect a reduction in scar size as measured by MRI at 12 months. We have amended our clinical protocol to reflect these changes, which amendment was approved by the Data Safety Monitoring Board and was submitted to the FDA in February 2016.
 
In October 2016, we announced completion of enrollment of the Phase II portion of the ALLSTAR trial in which 142 subjects were randomized to the active or control treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, and of whom 134 received a single infusion of either CAP-1002 or placebo into the infarct-associated coronary artery. Patients in the trial were enrolled at approximately 30 centers in the U.S. and in Canada.
 
In December 2013, Capricor entered into a Collaboration Agreement and Exclusive License Option with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen. Under the agreement, Janssen has an exclusive option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with Capricor, pursuant to which, if exercised, Janssen would receive a worldwide, exclusive license to exploit CAP-1002 as well as certain allogeneic CSps and CDCs in the field of cardiology, except as may otherwise be agreed with respect to certain indications to be determined. Janssen has the right to exercise the option at any time until 60 days after the delivery by Capricor of the six-month follow-up results from the Phase II portion of the ALLSTAR clinical trial of CAP-1002. We expect to receive Janssen’s decision with respect to this option in the third quarter of 2017 following the delivery of the six-month results from the ALLSTAR trial.
 
Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne Clinical Trial
 
We are currently conducting the randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne clinical trial which was designed to evaluate the safety and exploratory efficacy of CAP-1002 in approximately 24 patients with cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CAP-1002 or usual care available for DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. In patients receiving CAP-1002, a dose of 25 million cells was infused into each of the three main coronary arteries (75 million cells total), which allowed for CAP-1002 to be delivered to large areas of the myocardium. Patients are to be followed for periodic evaluations over the course of 12 months. Exploratory efficacy will be evaluated according to several different outcome measures, including cardiac MRI. This study is funded in part through a grant award from CIRM. Those patients who did not receive CAP-1002 may be eligible to receive open-label CAP-1002 after all participants have completed the controlled portion of the study and the Data Safety Monitoring Board has given the recommendation to proceed with the open-label extension. In April 2015, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD.

We announced the completion of enrollment of 25 patients in the HOPE-Duchenne trial in September 2016. To date, the Data Safety Monitoring Board has completed four safety reviews, and following each review, recommended that the trial continue. We expect to report top-line six-month results early in the second quarter of 2017 and report top-line 12-month results in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Additionally, depending upon trial results and available resources, we are planning to expand our CAP-1002 clinical development program in DMD beyond cardiac aspects of the disease. This expansion includes the conduct of a clinical trial which we plan to commence in the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval.
 
Phase I/II DYNAMIC Clinical Trial
 
The Phase I/II DYNAMIC trial, of which the Phase I portion has concluded, was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAP-1002 in the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or non-ischemic origin. This condition is characterized by chronic structural and functional abnormalities present throughout the heart’s contractile tissue. In the DYNAMIC trial, CAP-1002 was infused into all three main coronary arteries to obtain broad exposure. Following infusion, patients were followed for one year. The trial was funded in part through a grant award from the NIH.
 
We initiated the open-label, dose-escalating Phase I portion of the DYNAMIC trial in December 2014 at a single center, CSMC, and in April 2015, completed enrollment with 14 patients with NYHA Class III heart failure. Each patient was administered CAP-1002 via a one-time, triple coronary infusion at one of several evenly-divided dose levels (37.5 million, 50 million, 62.5 million, or 75 million cells total). Initial top-line six-month results were presented at the American Heart Association’s Annual Scientific Sessions in November 2015. Multi-vessel intracoronary infusion of CAP-1002 in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy was shown to be safe in this study with no major adverse cardiac events reported at one month or at six months post-infusion. Although this trial was intended as a safety study, the six-month data demonstrated encouraging and congruent preliminary efficacy signals in multiple parameters, including ejection fraction, ventricular volumes, exercise capacity and subjective well-being.
 
In June 2016, Capricor reported positive 12-month data from the DYNAMIC study. For the 12 patients available for follow-up at one year, improvements from baseline in key cardiac function and dimensional indices that had been observed at six months were directionally maintained. Importantly, the change in median left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to 12 months maintained its level of statistical significance that was shown at six months (p=0.02 at both time points) and, on an absolute basis, continued to improve from six to 12 months. Of the five NYHA Class III subjects who received the highest dose of CAP-1002 (75 million cells), two subjects improved by two Classes (to Class I) and three improved by one Class (to Class II) at six months. At 12 months, three of these five subjects were assessed as Class I and two as Class II, demonstrating further improvement and indicating durability of the benefit of CAP-1002 on heart failure status for as long as one year following administration. CAP-1002 infusion was well-tolerated in DYNAMIC. Two of the 14 patients, who were in the lower two of the four dose cohorts, died from progressive heart failure approximately one and three months prior to study conclusion. Although we have designed a Phase II study to evaluate CAP-1002 in the heart failure population, at this time we have not made a determination with respect to conducting the Phase II portion of the DYNAMIC trial.
 
CAP-2003: 
 
CAP-2003 comprises of exosomes secreted by CDCs, and is believed to mediate many of the effects that are observed with these cells, including anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic effects. We are currently conducting studies in pre-clinical models of cardiac, inflammatory and various other conditions to explore the possible therapeutic benefits that CAP-2003 may possess. We are planning to evaluate CAP-2003 in preclinical studies for the treatment of HLHS. We hope to submit an IND for CAP-2003 to enable clinical development in the second half of 2017.

CAP-1001: 
 
CAP-1001 consists of autologous CDCs. This product candidate was evaluated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I CADUCEUS clinical trial in patients who had recently experienced an MI. The study was sponsored and conducted by CSMC in collaboration with JHU. Of the 25 patients enrolled, 17 received an intracoronary infusion of CAP-1001 and eight received standard of care. 16 of the 17 patients treated with CAP-1001 showed a mean reduction of approximately 45% in scar mass and an increase in viable heart muscle at one-year following MI. The eight patients in the control group had no significant change in scar size. The data from CADUCEUS, using autologous CDCs, suggests that CDCs are effective in reducing scar size within several months of a heart attack. The design of our ongoing ALLSTAR trial of CAP-1002, an allogeneic product, is based on the results of CADUCEUS. In addition, ALLSTAR is evaluating the potential efficacy of CAP-1002 in patients between 90 days and one year post-MI, a patient population that CADUCEUS was not designed to study. At present, there is no plan for another clinical trial for CAP-1001.
 
CSps: 
 
CSps are a 3D micro-tissue from which CDCs are derived, and have shown significant healing effects in pre-clinical models of heart failure. While we consider CSps an important asset, at present there is no plan to develop CSps as a therapeutic agent.
 
Natriuretic Peptides: 
 
We have recently discontinued further development of two of our former natriuretic peptide product candidates, Cenderitide (CD-NP) and CU-NP, to more efficiently focus our resources and efforts on our cell therapy (CAP-1002) and CDC exosomes (CAP-2003) programs. For additional information, see “Intellectual Property and Proprietary Know-How — Company Technology – Cenderitide and CU-NP” contained in Part I, Item 1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 10 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Know-How
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent rights for our products, formulations, processes, methods of use and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and abroad. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. Even patent protection, however, may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure and use of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions relevant to our technologies and important to our business.
 
The development of complex biotechnology products such as ours typically includes the early discovery of a technology platform – often in an academic institution – followed by increasingly focused development around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and development of scalable manufacturing processes, formulation, delivery and dosage regimens. As a result, biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are made at different times in the development cycle and cover different aspects of the product. Earlier filed broad patent applications directed to the discovery of the platform technology thus usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as scalable manufacturing processes and dosing regimens. Patent expirations on products may therefore span several years and vary from country to country based on the scope of available coverage. Our issued patents would expire as early as 2024 and as late as 2031 upon payment of patent maintenance fees. There are also limited opportunities to obtain extensions of patent terms in certain countries.
 
Capricor’s Technology - CAP-1002, CAP-1001, CSps and Exosomes 
 
Capricor has entered into exclusive license agreements for intellectual property rights related to cardiac-derived cells with Università Degli Studi Di Roma La Sapienza, or the University of Rome, JHU and CSMC. In addition, Capricor has filed patent applications related to enhancements or validation of the technology developed by its own scientists.

University of Rome License Agreement
 
Capricor and the University of Rome entered into a License Agreement, dated June 21, 2006, or the Rome License Agreement, which provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by the University of Rome to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize licensed products under the licensed patent rights in all fields. With respect to any new or future patent applications assigned to the University of Rome utilizing cardiac stem cells in cardiac care, Capricor has a first right of negotiation for a certain period of time to obtain a license thereto.
 
Pursuant to the Rome License Agreement, Capricor paid the University of Rome a license issue fee, is currently paying minimum annual royalties in the amount of 20,000 Euros per year, and is obligated to pay a lower-end of a mid-range double-digit percentage on all royalties received as a result of sublicenses granted, which are net of any royalties paid to third parties under a license agreement from such third party to Capricor. The minimum annual royalties are creditable against future royalty payments.
 
The Rome License Agreement will, unless extended or sooner terminated, remain in effect until the later of the last claim of any patent or until any patent application comprising licensed patent rights has expired or been abandoned. Under the terms of the Rome License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy. Either party will have up to 90 days to cure its material breach.
 
The Johns Hopkins University License Agreement 
 
Capricor and JHU entered into an Exclusive License Agreement, effective June 22, 2006, or the JHU License Agreement, which provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by JHU to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize licensed products and licensed services under the licensed patent rights in all fields and a nonexclusive right to the know-how. In May 2009, the JHU License Agreement was amended to add additional patent rights to the JHU License Agreement in consideration of a payment to JHU and reimbursement of patent costs. Capricor and JHU executed a Second Amendment to the JHU License Agreement, effective as of December 20, 2013, pursuant to which, among other things, certain definitions were added or amended, the timing of certain obligations was revised and other obligations of the parties were clarified.
 
Pursuant to the JHU License Agreement, JHU was paid an initial license fee and, thereafter, Capricor is required to pay minimum annual royalties on the anniversary dates of the JHU License Agreement. The minimum annual royalties range from $5,000 on the first and second anniversary dates to $20,000 on the tenth anniversary date and thereafter. The minimum annual royalties are creditable against a low single-digit running royalty on net sales of products and net service revenues, which Capricor is also required to pay under the JHU License Agreement, which running royalty may be subject to further reduction in the event that Capricor is required to pay royalties on any patent rights to third parties in order to make or sell a licensed product. In addition, Capricor is required to pay a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received by it from sublicenses granted, and is required to pay JHU certain defined development milestone payments upon the successful completion of certain phases of its clinical studies and upon receiving approval from the FDA. The development milestones range from $100,000 upon successful completion of a full Phase I clinical study to $1,000,000 upon full FDA market approval and are fully creditable against payments owed by Capricor to JHU on account of sublicense consideration attributable to milestone payments received from a sublicensee. The maximum aggregate amount of milestone payments payable under the JHU License Agreement, as amended, is $1,850,000. In May 2015, Capricor paid the development milestone related to Phase I that was owed to JHU pursuant to the terms of the JHU License Agreement.
 
The JHU License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect in each applicable country until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent within the patent rights, or, if no patents are issued, then for twenty years from the effective date. Under the terms of the JHU License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy, or fail to cure a material breach within 30 days after notice. In addition, Capricor may terminate for any reason upon 60 days’ written notice.
 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreements
 
License Agreement for CDCs
 
On January 4, 2010, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC, or the Original CSMC License Agreement, for certain intellectual property rights. In 2013, the Original CSMC License Agreement was amended twice resulting in, among other things, a reduction in the percentage of sublicense fees which would have been payable to CSMC. Effective December 30, 2013, Capricor entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC, or the Amended CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, certain definitions were added or amended, the timing of certain obligations was revised and other obligations of the parties were clarified.

The Amended CSMC License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marbán on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license, Capricor will have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations.
 
Pursuant to the Original CSMC License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor was obligated to reimburse CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain spending and development milestones. The annual spending requirements range from $350,000 to $800,000 each year between 2010 and 2017 (with the exception of 2014, for which there was no annual spending requirement).
 
Pursuant to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, Capricor remains obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty-bearing product. In 2010, Capricor discontinued its research under some of the patents.
 
The Amended CSMC License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Amended CSMC License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties; (v) within 90 days if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within 90 days; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within 90 days after notice.
 
On March 20, 2015, Capricor and CSMC entered into a First Amendment to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to delete certain patent applications from the list of Scheduled Patents which Capricor determined not to be material to the portfolio.
 
On August 5, 2016, Capricor and CSMC entered into a Second Amendment to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, or the Second License Amendment, pursuant to which the parties agreed to add certain patent families to the schedule of patent rights set forth in the agreement. Under the Second License Amendment, (i) the description of patent rights in Schedule A has been replaced by a Revised Schedule A that includes two additional patent family applications; (ii) Capricor paid an upfront fee of $2,500; and (iii) Capricor reimbursed CSMC approximately $10,000 for attorneys’ fees and filing fees that were incurred in connection with the additional patent families.
 
License Agreement for Exosomes
 
On May 5, 2014, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC, or the Exosomes License Agreement, for certain intellectual property rights related to exosomes technology. The Exosomes License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) in order to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and to develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marbán on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license, Capricor shall have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations.
 
Pursuant to the Exosomes License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor reimbursed CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain non-monetary development milestones and is obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a single-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty bearing product.

The Exosomes License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Exosomes License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties; (v) within 90 days if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within 90 days; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within 90 days after notice.
 
On February 27, 2015, Capricor and CSMC entered into a First Amendment to Exosomes License Agreement, or the First Exosomes License Amendment. Under the First Exosomes License Amendment, (i) the description of patent rights in Schedule A has been replaced by a Revised Schedule A that includes four additional patent applications; (ii) Capricor was required to pay CSMC an upfront fee of $20,000; (iii) Capricor is required to reimburse CSMC approximately $34,000 for attorneys’ fees and filing fees that were incurred in connection with the additional patent rights; and (iv) Capricor is required to pay CSMC certain defined product development milestone payments upon reaching certain phases of its clinical studies and upon receiving approval for a product from the FDA. The product development milestones range from $15,000 upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase I clinical trial of a product to $75,000 upon receipt of FDA approval for a product. The maximum aggregate amount of milestone payments payable under the Exosomes License Agreement, as amended, is $190,000. 
 
On June 10, 2015, Capricor and CSMC entered into a Second Amendment to Exosomes License Agreement, thereby amending the Exosomes License Agreement further to add an additional patent application to the Schedule of Patent Rights.
 
On August 5, 2016, Capricor and CSMC entered into a Third Amendment to the Exosomes License Agreement, or the Third Exosomes License Amendment pursuant to which the parties agreed to add certain patent families to the schedule of patent rights under the agreement. Under the Third Exosomes License Amendment, (i) the description of patent rights in Schedule A has been replaced by a Revised Schedule A that includes two additional patent family applications; (ii) Capricor paid CSMC an upfront fee of $2,500; and (iii) Capricor reimbursed CSMC approximately $16,000 for attorneys’ fees and filing fees that were incurred in connection with the additional patent families.
 
Collaboration Agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc.
 
On December 27, 2013, Capricor entered into a Collaboration Agreement and Exclusive License Option, or the Janssen Agreement, with Janssen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, Capricor and Janssen agreed to collaborate on the development of Capricor’s cell therapy program for cardiovascular applications, including its lead product candidate, CAP-1002. Capricor and Janssen further agreed to collaborate on the development of cell manufacturing in preparation for future clinical trials. Under the Janssen Agreement, Capricor was paid $12.5 million, and Capricor agreed to contribute to the development of a chemistry, manufacturing and controls package. In addition, Janssen has the exclusive right to enter into an exclusive license agreement pursuant to which Janssen would receive a worldwide, exclusive license to exploit CAP-1002 as well as certain allogeneic CSps and CDCs in the field of cardiology, except as may otherwise be agreed with respect to certain indications to be determined. Janssen has the right to exercise the option at any time until 60 days after the delivery by Capricor of the six-month follow-up results from Phase II of Capricor’s ALLSTAR clinical trial for CAP-1002. If Janssen exercises its option rights, Capricor would receive an upfront license fee and additional milestone payments, which may total up to $325.0 million. In addition, a royalty ranging from a low double-digit percentage to a lower-end of a mid-range double-digit percentage would be paid on sales of licensed products.
 
Company Technology – Cenderitide and CU-NP
 
The Company entered into an exclusive license agreement for intellectual property rights related to natriuretic peptides with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, or Mayo, a Clinical Trial Funding Agreement with Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, and a Transfer Agreement with Medtronic, all of which also include certain intellectual property licensing provisions.

--

Mayo License Agreement
 
The Company and Mayo previously entered into a Technology License Agreement with respect to Cenderitide on January 20, 2006, which was filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on September 21, 2007, and which was amended on June 2, 2008, or as so amended, the CD-NP Agreement. On June 13, 2008, the Company and Mayo entered into a Technology License Agreement with respect to CU-NP, or the CU-NP Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 14, 2008. On November 14, 2013, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Mayo, or the Amended Mayo Agreement. The Amended Mayo Agreement amended and restated in its entirety each of the CD-NP Agreement and the CU-NP Agreement, and created a single amended and restated license agreement between the Company and Mayo with respect to CD-NP and CU-NP.
 
On February 13, 2017, the Company provided Mayo with a notice of termination of the Amended Mayo Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03 of the Amended Mayo Agreement, thereby relinquishing all rights previously licensed by Mayo to Capricor with respect to CD-NP and CU-NP. The Company provided 90 days’ notice of the effectiveness of termination, but Mayo has indicated to the Company that it considers the Amended Mayo Agreement to be terminated as of February 14, 2017 due to an ongoing dispute with Mayo regarding the payment of certain fees incurred in the prosecution of the intellectual property rights licensed by Mayo to the Company, which fees the Company does not deem to be material in amount. The Company elected to terminate the Amended Mayo Agreement so we may focus our resources and efforts on our cell therapy (CAP-1002) and CDC exosomes (CAP-2003) programs.
 
Medtronic Clinical Trial Funding Agreement 
 
In February 2011, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Funding Agreement with Medtronic. Pursuant to the agreement, Medtronic provided funding and equipment necessary for the Company to conduct a Phase I clinical trial to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Cenderitide when delivered to heart failure patients through continuous subcutaneous infusion using Medtronic’s pump technology.
 
The agreement provided that intellectual property conceived in or otherwise resulting from the performance of the Phase I clinical trial will be jointly owned by the Company and Medtronic, or the Joint Intellectual Property, and that the Company is to pay royalties to Medtronic based on the net sales of a product covered by the Joint Intellectual Property.  The agreement further provided that, if the parties fail to enter into a definitive commercial license agreement with respect to Cenderitide, each party will have a right of first negotiation to license exclusive rights to any Joint Intellectual Property.
 
Pursuant to its terms, the agreement expired in February 2012, following the completion of the Phase I clinical trial and the delivery of data and reports related to such study. Although the Medtronic agreement expired, there are certain provisions that survive the expiration of the agreement, including the obligation to pay royalties on products that might be covered by the Joint Intellectual Property. The Company and Medtronic subsequently entered into a Transfer Agreement, described below. 

Medtronic Transfer Agreement
 
On October 8, 2014, the Company entered into a Transfer Agreement, or the Transfer Agreement, with Medtronic to acquire patent rights relating to the formulation and pump delivery of natriuretic peptides. Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, Medtronic has assigned to the Company all of its right, title and interest in all natriuretic peptide patents and patent applications previously owned by Medtronic or co-owned by Medtronic and the Company, or the Natriuretic Peptide Patents. Under the Transfer Agreement, the Company received all rights to the Natriuretic Peptide Patents, including the right to grant licenses and to make assignments without approval from Medtronic.
 
The Transfer Agreement became effective on October 8, 2014 and will expire simultaneously with the expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims. Both parties have the right to terminate the Transfer Agreement upon 30 days written notice to the other party in the event of a default which has not been cured within such 30-day period. In addition, Medtronic had the right to terminate the Transfer Agreement and to have the rights to the Natriuretic Peptide Patents reassigned to it by the Company if either the Company, an affiliate, or a non-party licensee failed to commence a clinical trial of a CD-NP product within 18 months from the effective date. Such condition was satisfied when the Company initiated its clinical trial of Cenderitide in January 2015.

In the event of a termination of the Transfer Agreement, (i) the Natriuretic Peptide Patents which were not owned or co-owned by the Company prior to the effective date of the Transfer Agreement shall be assigned back to Medtronic; (ii) the Company’s rights in the Natriuretic Peptide Patents that were co-owned by Capricor pursuant to the Clinical Trial Funding Agreement will remain with the Company, subject to the surviving terms and provisions thereof; and (iii) the Company shall assign back to Medtronic those rights that were co-owned by Medtronic pursuant to the Clinical Trial Funding Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, Medtronic was paid an upfront payment of $100,000, and the Company is obligated to pay Medtronic a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of products, a low double-digit percentage of any consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights, and a mid-double-digit percentage of any monetary awards or settlements received by the Company as a result of enforcement of the Natriuretic Peptide Patents against a non-party entity, less the costs and attorney’s fees incurred to enforce the Natriuretic Peptide Patents. In addition, there are additional payments that may become due from the Company upon the achievement of certain defined milestones, which payments, in the aggregate, total up to $7.0 million.
 
In light of our decision to terminate our development program with respect to natriuretic peptides, the Company is now considering whether or not to cease prosecution of some or all of the Natriuretic Peptide Patents and has offered to reassign to Medtronic rights to certain patent applications obtained through the Transfer Agreement.
 
Manufacturing
 
Capricor presently maintains its laboratory and research facilities in leased premises located at CSMC, or the CSMC Lease. We presently manufacture CAP-1002 and CAP-2003 in a facility which is owned by and located within CSMC and in which we believe we follow good manufacturing practices, but which is not a current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, approved facility. Capricor manufactured CAP-1002 at this facility for its ongoing ALLSTAR and HOPE-Duchenne clinical studies. Capricor has commenced discussions on an amendment to the CSMC Lease with CSMC to extend the term of the CSMC Lease and include the manufacturing facility within its provisions. If CSMC revokes its permission to allow Capricor to utilize the manufacturing facility, Capricor would have to secure alternative facilities in which to manufacture its products, which would involve a significant monetary investment and would negatively impact the progress of our planned clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, we would have to establish a collaboration agreement with a third party or build out our own manufacturing facility for any Phase III trial. We are actively in discussions with third parties regarding a potential technology transfer of our cell manufacturing processes in anticipation of potential advanced clinical studies and commercialization.
 
In addition to manufacturing CAP-1002 for its own clinical trials, Capricor has agreed, subject to final documentation, to provide CAP-1002 for investigational purposes in two clinical trials sponsored by CSMC. The first trial is known as “Regression of Fibrosis and Reversal of Diastolic Dysfunction in HFpEF Patients Treated with Allogeneic CDCs.” Dr. Eduardo Marbán is the named principal investigator under the study. The second trial is known as “Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension treated with Cardiosphere-derived Allogeneic Stem Cells.” In both studies, Capricor will provide the necessary number of doses and will receive a negotiated amount of monetary compensation therefor.
 
CAP-1001: 
 
The manufacturing process for CAP-1001 begins with a biopsy of cardiac tissue from the patient taken during a simple outpatient procedure. This tissue is taken to the lab where the cells are isolated, expanded, and processed through a series of proprietary unit operations. After release testing and quality review of the manufacturing data, this drug product is then administered into the same patient. The time frame for autologous manufacturing is approximately 6-8 weeks post-biopsy until the product can be administered to the patient.
 
CAP-1002: 
 
The general process for manufacturing CAP-1002 differs very little from the CAP-1001 process, except that it can be executed at a significantly larger scale. This is because the starting material is from an entire heart taken from a donor that was collected from an organ procurement organization, or OPO, rather than a small biopsy taken from the patient. After expanding, processing, release testing and quality review, the CAP-1002 product becomes available for administration to patients. CAP-1002 is cryo-preserved, enabling us to produce large lots that can be frozen and then administered to patients as needed.
 

15
--

 

CAP-2003: 
 
The process for manufacturing CAP-2003 starts with the proprietary process of creating a cell bank from donor heart tissue through the expansion of CDCs. Afterwards, exosomes are isolated from the expanded CDCs. After these exosomes are prepared, formulated, filled, tested, and validated, the exosomes product becomes available for therapeutic use. We believe that the allogeneic, acellular nature of exosomes enables us to potentially create a commercially scalable cell-derived product. 
 
Research and Development
 
Capricor’s research and development program has been advanced in part through federal and state grants and loan awards totaling over approximately $30.0 million to date. Our ongoing research and development activities primarily concern CDCs and CDC exosomes, and are focused on the characterization of their composition and actions, the evaluation of their therapeutic potential in selected disease settings, the development of next generation product candidates, and the identification of new technologies and indications. Capricor spent approximately $16.0 million and $13.8 million on research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
 
We are engaged in fields that are characterized by extensive worldwide research and competition by pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, specialized biotechnology companies, hospitals, physicians and academic institutions, both in the United States and abroad. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies, and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same indications as our product candidates. We expect any future products and product candidates we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, extent of adverse side effects, and convenience of treatment procedures. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and significant technological change. The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to evolving cell therapy and exosome technologies. There can be no assurance that existing or future therapies developed by others will not render our potential products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures, or other collaborations.
Government Regulation 
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending new drug application, or NDA, or a pending biologics license application, or BLA, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
Drug Approval Process 
 
A drug or drug candidate may not be marketed or sold in the United States until it has received FDA approval. The process to receiving such approval is long, expensive and risky, and includes the following steps:

· | pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


16
--


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
Regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor affecting our ability to commercialize any of our products, as well as the timing of such commercialization and our ongoing research and development activities. The commercialization of drug products requires regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Various laws and regulations govern or influence the research and development, non-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, processing, packing, validation, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, registration, listing, distribution, advertising, sale, marketing and post-marketing commitments of our products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require expending substantial resources.
 
Pharmaceutical products such as ours may not be commercially marketed without prior approval from the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. In the United States, the process for obtaining FDA approval typically includes pre-clinical studies, the filing of an IND, human clinical trials and filing and approval of either an NDA, for chemical pharmaceutical products, or a BLA for biological pharmaceutical products. The results of pre-clinical testing, which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations, details concerning the drug manufacturing process and its controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND that must be reviewed and become effective before clinical testing can begin. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for approval covering each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. Once a sponsor submits an IND, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. If the FDA has comments or questions within this 30-day period, the issue(s) must be resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA before clinical trials can begin. In addition, the FDA, an IRB or Capricor may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials can only proceed under terms authorized by the FDA. Our non-clinical and clinical studies must conform to the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, respectively, which are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of submitted data and protect the rights and well-being of study patients. Information for certain clinical trials also must be publicly disclosed within certain time limits on the clinical trial registry and results databank maintained by the NIH.
 
Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process; however, the phases may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase I clinical trials typically are conducted in a small number of volunteers or patients to assess the early tolerability and safety profile, and the pattern of drug absorption, distribution and metabolism;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II clinical trials typically are conducted in a limited patient population with a specific disease in order to assess appropriate dosages and dose regimens, expand evidence of the safety profile and evaluate preliminary efficacy; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III clinical trials typically are larger scale, multicenter, well-controlled trials conducted on patients with a specific disease to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the registration of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, proposed labeling and other information are then submitted to the FDA in the form of either an NDA or BLA for review and potential approval to begin commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information in a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or deny the approval if it determines that the NDA or BLA does not provide an adequate basis for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of an NDA or BLA and may require additional testing. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and sometimes with specified post-marketing commitments and/or distribution and use restrictions imposed under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Any approval required from the FDA might not be obtained on a timely basis, if at all.
 

17
--

 

Among the conditions for an NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the manufacturing operations conform on an ongoing basis with current cGMP. In complying with cGMP, we must expend time, money and effort in the areas of training, production and quality control within our own organization and at our contract manufacturing facilities. A successful inspection of the manufacturing facility by the FDA is usually a prerequisite for final approval of a pharmaceutical product. Following approval of the NDA or BLA, we and our manufacturers will remain subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and the conditions of approval. We will also face similar inspections coordinated by foreign regulatory authorities.
 
Post -Approval Requirements
 
Often times, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval requirements are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Additionally, we will have to establish a collaboration agreement with a third party or build out our own manufacturing facility to support for a Phase III trial, or other registration trial or for commercialization purposes.

Capricor leases space for its corporate offices pursuant to a lease that was originally effective for a two-year period beginning July 1, 2013 with an option to extend the lease for an additional twelve months. The monthly lease payment was $16,620 per month for the first twelve months of the term and increased to $17,285 per month for the second twelve months of the term. On March 3, 2015, Capricor executed a Second Amendment to Lease, or the Second Lease Amendment, with The Bubble Real Estate Company, LLC, pursuant to which (i) additional space was added to the Company’s corporate office lease and (ii) the Company exercised its option to extend the lease term through June 30, 2016. Under the terms of the Second Lease Amendment, commencing February 2, 2015, the base rent was $17,957 for one month, and, commencing March 2, 2015, the base rent increased to $21,420 per month for four months. Commencing July 1, 2015, the base rent increased to $22,111 per month for the remainder of the lease term. On May 25, 2016, Capricor entered into a Third Amendment to Lease, or the Third Lease Amendment, with The Bubble Real Estate Company, LLC. Under the terms of the Third Lease Amendment, the lease term commenced on July 1, 2016 and will end on December 31, 2018. Commencing July 1, 2016, the base rent increased to $22,995 per month for the first twelve months of the term, will increase to $23,915 per month for the second twelve months of the term, and, thereafter, will increase to $24,872 for the remainder of the lease term.
 
Capricor currently leases two research laboratories from CSMC under the terms of a three-year lease which expires on June 1, 2017. The rent expense for the first six-month period was approximately $15,461 per month. Commencing with the seventh month of the lease term, the rent expense increased to approximately $19,350 per month. The amount of rent expense is subject to annual adjustments according to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Capricor is currently in discussions with CSMC regarding an amendment to extend the term of the CSMC Lease and include the manufacturing facility within its provisions.
 
With permission from CSMC, Capricor presently manufactures CAP-1002 and CAP-2003 in a facility which is owned by and located within CSMC. Our laboratories and manufacturing facility are located at 8700 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90048. As our operations expand, we expect our space requirements and related expenses to increase.
