ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global medical technology company focused on the design, development and commercialization of surgical solutions for the treatment of patients suffering from spinal disorders. We have a comprehensive portfolio of orthobiologics and spinal implant solutions to meet the varying combinations of products that neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons need to perform fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine. Our orthobiologics products consist of a broad range of advanced and traditional bone graft substitutes designed to improve bone fusion rates following a wide range of orthopedic surgeries, including spine, hip, and extremities procedures. Our spinal implant portfolio consists of an extensive line of products to facilitate spinal fusion in degenerative, minimally invasive surgery (MIS), and complex spinal deformity procedures. Expertise in both orthobiologic sciences and spinal implant product development allows us to offer surgeon customers a differentiated portfolio and a complete solution to meet their patients' fusion requirements. We currently market our products in the United States and in approximately 30 countries worldwide.
SeaSpine was incorporated in Delaware on February 12, 2015 in connection with the spin-off of the orthobiologics and spinal implant business of Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (Integra), a diversified medical technology company. The spin-off occurred on July 1, 2015. Our corporate offices are at 5770 Armada Drive, Carlsbad, California.
Spine Anatomy
The spine is a column of bone and cartilage that consists of 33 interlocking bones, called vertebrae, which stack upon each other at a slight angle to form the spine’s S-shaped curve. Except for the bottom nine vertebrae, the vertebrae are separated by thin regions of cartilage known as intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers that facilitate motion and absorb stress during movement. The spine protects the spinal cord and acts as the core of the human skeleton, extending from the base of the skull to the pelvis. Soft tissues, including ligaments, tendons and muscles, are attached to the vertebrae and provide stability to the vertebral segment. The spinal cord carries nerves that exit through openings between the vertebrae and deliver sensation and control to the body. Below is a diagram of the lateral view of the spine:

The spine consists of five regions, of which the cervical, thoracic and lumbar are the three primary regions. The cervical region consists of the seven vertebrae extending from the base of the skull to the shoulders. The thoracic, or central, region consists of the next twelve vertebrae in the middle of the back. Each vertebra in the thoracic region is connected to two ribs that protect the body’s vital organs. Below the thoracic region, the lumbar region consists of five vertebrae in the lower back and is the primary load-bearing region of the spine. The thoracic and lumbar regions are commonly called thoracolumbar and many of the products and procedures to treat these regions are similar. The final two regions of the spine, the sacrum and coccyx, consist of nine naturally fused vertebrae connected to the hip bones to provide support for the spine.
In spinal fusion procedures, two or more vertebrae are fused to eliminate instability as a result of deformity, degeneration or trauma affecting the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. During the procedure, spinal implant products are used to decompress, align, and stabilize the spine and the surgeon will often remove the damaged intervertebral disc and replace it with a bone graft substitute to allow new bone to grow and to fuse the affected vertebrae together. In addition to the bone graft substitute, the surgeon may replace the removed disc with an interbody device. An interbody device, which may be made out of machined bone, titanium, 3D-printed titanium or polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is designed to maintain spine alignment and appropriate spacing while allowing bone to grow between the vertebrae to achieve bone fusion. Procedures that include the implantation of interbody devices are often referred to by the surgical approach used to place the interbody device in the disc space. A lateral lumbar interbody fusion uses an approach that accesses the spine from the side of the patient’s body; a posterior lateral interbody fusion uses a direct posterior approach from the patient’s back; a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion uses an angled approach from either the left or right side of the back; and an anterior lumbar interbody fusion uses a direct anterior approach from the patient’s front (stomach) area.
Our Competitive Strengths
We are dedicated to providing a comprehensive portfolio of innovative, procedurally focused products designed to work together to drive fusion. The latest advancements in bone biology and materials science guide the development of in-house manufactured advanced orthobiologics and proprietary spinal implant technology engineered to address the many nuances of spinal pathology. Our products can be tailored to meet individual patient needs, delivering both clinical and economic value to patients, surgeons, and hospital systems. Our executive management team has extensive experience in the spine and medical technology industries. We believe that our management team, combined with the following competitive strengths, will enable us to continue to grow our revenue and increase our presence in the markets we serve.
Our Integrated Orthobiologics Business drives alignment and priorities across research and development, marketing, quality and manufacturing operations designed to deliver clinical value through best of class, cost effective products, the vast majority of which are processed in-house. By controlling the design, manufacturing, and quality processes, we believe that we are better able to control the overall product quality and consistency while also providing cost of goods advantage and operational leverage with volume increases.
•Our focused R&D team and disciplined development process optimizes our new products by isolating the manufacturing elements to optimize product performance and ultimately deliver differentiated products. 
•We are investing in various studies to differentiate our products with science and data. Most notably, we sponsored a study comparing two leading Cellular Bone Grafts with our Strand Plus demineralized bone fibers that was published in 2020 in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS). The study concluded that the cells in cellular bone matrix (CBM) products did not improve fusion or bone formation. The study also demonstrated that SeaSpine’s 
demineralized bone matrix (DBM) product, OsteoStrand Plus, outperformed the tested CBM product. This study substantiates payor and provider pushback for cellular bone grafts, and, combined with the previously published pre-clinical study comparing the OsteoStrand DBM fibers to six leading competitive DBMs, provides strong scientific support for SeaSpine’s differentiated DBM offerings, We will continue to invest in preclinical and clinical data to evidence our products and their clinical value..
•A synergistic channel strategy for orthobiologics products. Our dual branding strategy allows us to market our orthobiologics products through independent sales agents who carry competitive spinal implant products. Specifically, we market our orthobiologics under the SeaSpine and IsoTis brands, which allows sales agents who sell spinal implant products competitive with ours to continue to represent our orthobiologics products. We believe this dual branding strategy allows us to penetrate a greater number of customer accounts than we would otherwise serve if we marketed our orthobiologics products under a single brand.
•The combination of these elements along with a strengthened distribution channel, has allowed us to move into the #2 position in the US DBM market which is a critical factor for our continued access to IDN (independent distributor network) and GPO (group purchasing organization) networks.
Fusion Engineered™ Modular Spinal Implant Systems are available with multiple material and surface technology options developed specifically to leverage the strengths of our orthobiologics products. The modularity of these systems provides versatility while minimizing the amount of inventory required for each surgery.
•A range of innovative, PEEK interbody devices that incorporate NanoMetalene, a proprietary titanium surface technology with Reef Topography. We currently offer a wide range of sterile-packaged interbody devices that incorporate our proprietary NanoMetalene surface technology with Reef Topography. NanoMetalene is a surface technology for interbody implants that incorporates a sub-micron layer of commercially pure titanium bonded to a PEEK implant using a high-energy, low-temperature process called atomic fusion deposition. NanoMetalene is designed to provide implants a bone-friendly titanium surface on endplates and throughout graft apertures, while retaining the benefits associated with traditional PEEK implants, such as biocompatibility, a modulus of elasticity similar to bone, and excellent radiographic visibility for post-operative imaging. Reef Topography™ describes machined macrostructures and undercut features that pre-clinical studies show improve early biomechanical stability. Reef is designed to act as an integrated fusion scaffolding that increases surface area for new bone to grow onto and into the interbody device. We have exclusive rights to NanoMetalene and Reef Topography technologies within the spine market.
•A line of Waveform™ interbody implants offering the next level of 3D-printed titanium architectural innovation. Waveform™ technology balances key geometric and manufacturing advancements without compromising clinical requirements to deliver a highly porous and robust interbody solution. The interbody design is intended to balance subsidence resistance, implant stiffness, and bone graft packability, while maintaining radiographic visualization during intraoperative and postoperative imaging.
•An expandable posterior interbody solution that offers both parallel and lordotic expansion options to fit both the patient’s need as well as surgeon preference. The Explorer™ TO system provides a low-profile design for insertion with expansion versatility achieving up to 16mm in height and up to 20 degrees of lordosis. The streamlined and intuitive instrumentation provides the ability to pack biologics through the implant into the disc space after expansion.
•Modular solutions across the portfolio intended maximize clinical versatility, while minimizing the complexity and increased inventory requirements of non-modular systems. One of our foundational systems that incorporates modular technology is our Mariner Posterior Fixation Platform. The Mariner System is designed to address a wide range of pathologies with an efficient set of instruments and modular implants. Surgeons use Mariner to accommodate conventional, as well as minimally invasive approaches to treat degenerative and complex spine pathologies with a minimum number of trays. This allows surgeons to most effectively and efficiently use the most appropriate surgical techniques to address each unique patient condition. 
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to continue to scale our business in order to enhance our market position in orthobiologics and become a leader in the spinal implant market. To achieve our goal, we are investing in these strategies:
•Research and development to bring new products and techniques to market. We have recently increased, and intend to continue to increase, our annual research and development spending as a percentage of revenue in an effort to drive higher revenue growth through new product sales. We plan to continue to invest resources and to work with our surgeon customers to understand their needs and develop new and next-generation orthobiologics and spinal implant 
products designed to improve clinical outcomes. We employ dedicated orthobiologics engineers and scientists with expertise in material sciences, and biology and hardware engineers with expertise in product design and development. 
•Commercial infrastructure to further penetrate the U.S. orthobiologics and spinal implant markets and increase our focus in international markets where we currently have a presence. We have recently increased, and intend to continue to increase, the quality, size, exclusivity and geographic breadth of our network of independent sales agents in the United States. To support these efforts, we are investing more in, and are developing comprehensive support for, sales agent and surgeon training and education programs. We have hands-on cadaveric training facilities in Carlsbad, California and Wayne, Pennsylvania where we provide training for surgeons and sales agents. In addition, we plan to increase our presence within teaching institutions that provide spinal surgery fellowship programs to educate new surgeons on the use of our products. We believe these combined efforts will help surgeons become adept with our spinal implant products and techniques, thereby improving outcomes for their patients. Internationally, we intend to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on expanding and strengthening our presence in those markets where we currently have relationships with stocking distributors and to selectively expand into new markets. 
•Pre-clinical and post-market clinical study programs to generate data. We plan to invest to further develop our pre-clinical and clinical programs designed to generate peer-reviewed scientific evidence and a podium presence that we believe will support the performance of select orthobiologics and spinal implant solutions that may be compared to competing technologies. We believe that our NanoMetalene, Reef Topography and WaveFormTM technologies may have advantages over many existing implant materials and surface options, and that our fibers-based OsteoStrand® and OsteoStrand Plus tissue products are more efficacious and cost-effective than, higher cost cellular allografts bone grafts. 
•Opportunities to enhance our product offering through strategic alliances and acquisitions. We currently market several products under distribution agreements and licenses with third-parties. We intend to continue to pursue alliances and acquisition opportunities that we believe will provide us with technologies to strengthen our market position and grow our business. For example, in January 2020, we announced a strategic alliance agreement with 7D Surgical, Inc., a privately-held Toronto-based company developing advanced image guidance technologies and machine-vision-based registration algorithms to improve surgical workflow and patient care, under which we will seek to offer a customized, best-in-class navigational solution and enabling technology to our hospital and surgeon customers on a non-exclusive basis.
Our Products
We offer a portfolio of orthobiologics and spinal implant products for the treatment of patients suffering from spinal and other orthopedic disorders. Information regarding the amount and percentage of total revenue contributed by our orthobiologics and spinal implant products for each of the last two fiscal years may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this report under the sections entitled “Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019—Revenue” and in Part II, Item 8 of this report in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information.”
Orthobiologics
Our orthobiologics products are used in orthopedic and dental procedures and consist of a broad range of bone graft substitutes intended to address the key elements of bone regeneration.
Bone graft substitutes composed of natural biologic proteins and synthetic materials are designed to reduce the amount of autologous bone grafts needed for spinal fusion procedures. Bone graft substitutes, depending on their design, can be used entirely in place of the patient’s own bone tissue, called an autograft, or by extending the volume of bone graft material from the patient by combining it with the bone graft substitute.
Our orthobiologics portfolio includes fibers-based and particulate DBM, collagen ceramic matrices, demineralized cancellous allograft bone and synthetic bone void fillers. We offer our orthobiologics products in the form of fibers, putties, pastes, strips and DBM in a resorbable mesh for a range of surgical applications.
Demineralized Bone Matrix and Accell 
DBM formulations are designed to provide proteins and other growth factors at varying stages of the bone healing process. Developed in the early 1990s, our first-generation DBM formulations combined particulate-demineralized bone matrix with an inert carrier engineered for easy graft handling and graft containment. The carrier is a biocompatible synthetic polymer 
with an advantageous property that allows the product to remain moldable at room temperature, but becomes more viscous at body temperature once implanted, which we call reverse-phase. Subsequently, we developed a proprietary process to transform particulate-based DBM into a dispersed form to enhance the performance of the graft material. The result of this process was a DBM product we call Accell Bone Matrix. Accell Bone Matrix is an open structured, dispersed form of DBM, which increases the bioavailability of bone proteins at an earlier time in the healing cascade. Standard particulate DBM is dense and therefore the bone proteins release more slowly and in a sustained manner over time. The properties of Accell Bone Matrix and DBM are both desirable, which is why our advanced DBM products include both components to harness both the early and sustained release of bone proteins. Our Accell Evo3 and OsteoSurge 300 DBM products provide an optimized formulation of Accell Bone Matrix, particulate-based DBM, and our reverse-phase carrier. These products have a handling property for bone grafting procedures and contain three times the amount of the Accell Bone Matrix compared to earlier products. We believe that providing both the early-stage and late-stage accessibility of osteoinductive bone proteins provided by a composite of Accell Bone Matrix and the particulate-based demineralized matrix differentiates our product compared to competitive DBM products.
Our OsteoStrand® and Strand® Demineralized Bone Fibers product lines as well as our OsteoStrand Plus and Strand Plus product lines, which incorporate our proprietary Accell Bone Matrix, provide 100% demineralized bone fibers designed to facilitate and aid in fusion by maximizing osteoinductive content while providing an improved conductive matrix. The fibers were developed through a process that evaluated a variety of fiber geometries to optimize osteoinductivity and osteoconductivity, intraoperative handling and controlled expansion in order to facilitate surgical placement, to maintain surgical position and to allow the fibers to better fill the surgical defect with the overriding goal to improve fusion potential. 
Our OsteoBallast® and Ballast® Demineralized Bone Matrix in Resorbable Mesh product lines are designed to facilitate and aid in fusion. These products, which consist of a resorbable mesh containing 100% DBM without a carrier, are designed to simplify graft placement and help prevent graft migration while maximizing DBM content. OsteoBallast® is designed to provide surgeons with a simple means for delivering bone graft in posterior spine surgery that contours to the local anatomy while maintaining shape and volume under compression. The simplified technique is intended to be particularly valuable in MIS procedures, where placing the graft accurately through tubes and small incisions can be challenging.
We believe that our recently launched and existing product offerings deliver clinical value as payors and hospitals seek more cost effective orthobiologic solutions.
Collagen Ceramic Matrix Technologies
Our collagen ceramic matrix technology leverages a history of regenerative technology and collagen engineering. Our leading products in this category are currently marketed as IsoTis Mozaik and OsteoStrux and are engineered to provide a porous scaffold architecture and osteoconductivity. These products also support osteogenesis, as they are indicated for use with bone marrow aspirate, which contains osteogenic cells. These products are composed of highly purified beta-tricalcium phosphate granules, which provide mineral content to foster bone formation during the healing process in a framework of type-1 collagen that provides a scaffold for bone cell migration. These products are engineered with a resorption profile consistent with the rate of natural bone formation.
Other Bone Graft Substitutes
Our other bone graft substitute products consist of allograft cancellous bone scaffolds and synthetic bone void fillers.
Spinal Implants
    Our spinal implant portfolio consists of an extensive line of products for spinal decompression, alignment, and stabilization. Such products are typically used to facilitate fusion in degenerative, minimally invasive, and complex spinal deformity procedures throughout the lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the spine. Our products are increasingly focused on restoring adequate spinal balance and profile in the sagittal (front to back) plane, which we believe is widely recognized as an important factor to improve the quality of life in patients undergoing surgery for spinal degeneration or deformity. 
    Degenerative
    Our degenerative products include systems used in open and MIS procedures. Open procedures are still the most common surgical approach and involve a midline incision followed by retraction of the skin and soft tissues. We offer an extensive portfolio of degenerative products designed for use in both thoracolumbar and cervical spine cases.
Our innovative line of composite PEEK interbody devices featuring NanoMetalene surface technology with Reef Topography with various footprint and lordotic options, is designed to maintain spine alignment and appropriate spacing while allowing bone to grow between the vertebrae to achieve bone fusion. Our Reef-TO, Reef-TA and Reef-TH interbody devices for transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion procedures can be used to fuse the lumbar spine through a posterior approach that starts off to one side of the patient’s back. Our Vu a∙POD™ Prime NanoMetalene® and Reef-A interbody devices for anterior lumbar interbody fusion procedures can be used to fuse the spine through an anterior approach. Our Regatta NanoMetalene Lateral System is a comprehensive lateral lumbar interbody system that can be used to fuse the spine through a lateral approach. Our Cambria NanoMetalene interbody device can be used to fuse the cervical spine through an anterior approach. Our Shoreline® Anterior Cervical Standalone System, featuring the NanoMetalene with Reef Topography, is a modular plate and interbody device designed to maximize intraoperative flexibility to address a wide range of anatomy, surgical situations or bone in anterior cervical fusions. 
We launched anterior cervical and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion interbody 3D-printed devices under our Waveform™ brand in 2020. We plan on launching three additional devices covering the anterior lumbar interbody fusion, lateral lumbar interbody fusion and articulating transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion interbody device in 2021 to expand the product line.
We launched the next generation of our Explorer™ TO expandable interbody device system with complementary lordotic and parallel expanding implant options in 2020 and enhancements to that system are currently in development.
    We offer a comprehensive portfolio of spinal fixation products for the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine, consisting of rods, screws, plates and instrumentation to facilitate spinal decompression and fusion. Our Mariner Posterior Fixation System is a pedicle screw system for open and MIS procedures featuring modular threaded technology and accompanying instrumentation designed to reduce the number of trays needed for surgery and that provides surgeons with multiple intra-operative options to facilitate posterior lumbar fixation. We also offer a variety of screw and plating systems, such as our Cabo™ ACP Anterior Cervical Plating System, that combine large graft viewing windows and a visual confirmation locking system for cervical fixation.
Minimally Invasive Surgery
    MIS procedures are less invasive than traditional open surgery procedures, and may result in reduced post-operative pain, faster rates of healing and fewer procedure complications by minimizing incision size and tissue dissection. Our surgeon customers utilize our iPassage™ MIS Retractors, NewPort™ Tube Retractors, and new pedicle screw-based Mariner MIS Retractors to perform MIS fusions and decompression procedures, a surgical technique used to alleviate pain caused from compression on the spinal cord or the nerves that emanate from it. During the procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision and inserts the retractor through the skin and soft tissues down to the spinal column, creating a tunnel to the spine. The retractor is kept in place to hold the muscles open throughout the procedure. Through this tunnel, the surgeon accesses the spine using small instruments and inserts implants necessary for fusion, such as the screws and rods of our Mariner MIS Posterior Fixation System and NewPort MIS solutions. The Mariner MIS Posterior Fixation System features low-profile, robust towers for rod introduction and reduction as well as ultra-tough modular extended tab heads, capable of providing powerful instrumented compression and distraction of the spine. Our NewPort MIS product has extended tabs for a small incision profile and offers two rod delivery options for both mini-open and percutaneous approaches. Our MIS portfolio also includes a comprehensive set of decompression instruments, static and expandable interbody devices, and screw systems designed to facilitate access to the treatment area while minimizing anatomical disruption.
    Complex Spinal Deformity
    Our spinal implant products are used in complex spinal deformity procedures involving multiple spine segments, challenging anatomy, tumors, traumatic injury and revision of previous fusion surgeries. We define deformity as any variation in the natural curvature of the spine, the most common of which is scoliosis, an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine. We offer several technologies designed to address the needs of our surgeon customers who perform complex deformity procedures and the various derotation techniques they use to correct spine curvature. For example, our Daytona® Deformity System uses extended tab uniplanar and polyaxial screws with multiple rod options and intuitive instrumentation to create a versatile system adaptable to surgeon preference. Our Daytona Small Stature System, which has an adolescent idiopathic scoliosis indication, is designed to address standard to complex deformity cases in smaller-sized patients who need a lower profile construct due to anatomy constraints. We provide our systems in multiple configurations and materials to address patient requirements, including titanium alloy and cobalt chrome alloy rod options, as well as multiple rod diameters. Offering products with varying rod diameter and materials provides the surgeon different rod stiffness to treat individual patients. We offer both implant- and instrument-based reduction capabilities with our extended tab and locking cap products, as well as our uniplanar and D-planar screws and rapid sequential reduction towers. The Mariner Outrigger Revision System is an adjunct to the Mariner Posterior Fixation System designed to effectively revise and extend previous fusions. Our complex spinal implant portfolio allows surgeons to combine various product lines and approaches, offering several treatment options for the most difficult cases. In 2021, we plan to continue to extend the Mariner modular platform to address complex spine adult deformity pathologies.
Product Pipeline
We believe that our future success and ability to continue to drive revenue growth depends on our ability to sustain a similar cadence of launching new and next-generation products as we have demonstrated over the last few years. We continue to aggressively develop differentiated new products that we believe will allow us to enter new markets and be even more competitive in markets in which we are underrepresented. For example, during 2021, we expect to launch a new modular anterior lumbar interbody fusion system with multiple interbody and fixation options, a new anterior cervical plating system, a new posterior cervical and occipital fixation system, a new cervical and thoracolumbar modular corpectomy system, and an adult deformity posterior fixation system. 
Research and Development
We have a research and development organization dedicated to advancing our portfolio of orthobiologics and spinal implant products through product development and clinical affairs programs. Our product development efforts employ an integrated team approach that involves collaboration between surgeons, our engineers, our machinists, as well as our regulatory personnel. 
Our spinal implants product development team, in consultation with designing surgeons, formulates a design for the product and then our machinists build prototypes for testing in our prototyping development and testing operation at our Carlsbad, California facility. We use a broad scope of technologies designed to allow us to meet the complex engineering requirements of customers. As part of the development process, spine surgeons test the implantation of the products in our in-house cadaveric laboratories, which helps us design new products intended to meet the needs of both surgeon and patient. Our team refines or redesigns the prototype as necessary based on the results of the product testing, allowing us to perform rapid iterations of the design-prototype-test development cycle. Our clinical and regulatory personnel work in parallel with our product engineering personnel to facilitate regulatory clearances of our orthobiologics and spinal implant products. We believe that these product development efforts allow us to provide solutions that respond to the needs of our surgeon customers and their patients.
We plan to develop line extensions for our innovative orthobiologics technologies that will continue to reduce the amount of autologous bone graft needed for spinal fusion procedures. We are investigating new product formulations in the traditional DBM and Ceramic Matrix product categories. Our orthobiologics research and development team has experience in biomaterial sciences and bringing next generation technologies to market. 
We are also committed to developing new spinal implant products that leverage the NanoMetalene with Reef Topography, 3D-printed titanium and expandable interbody platforms technology and provide next generation solutions for our existing products or extend the range of solutions that we provide. We aim to further build upon our foundation of static and expandable interbodies through hyperlordotic and alternative approach options within the interbody space. We are also committed to providing products, such as additional hyperlordotic cage options and additional expandable technology solutions, 
to achieve appropriate curvature of the spine and that can improve sagittal balance, correcting the patient’s spinal alignment. We also plan to continue to develop next generation technologies that meet global demand, particularly with respect to cost and delivery methods in a manner which supports a scalable commercial model. 
Sales and Distribution
We currently market and sell our products in the United States and in approximately 30 countries worldwide. Our United States sales organization consists of regional and territory business managers who oversee a broad network of independent orthobiologics and spinal implant sales agents that receive commissions from us based on sales they generate. Our international sales organization consists of a sales management team that oversees a network of independent orthobiologics and spinal implant stocking distributors that purchase our products directly from us and independently sell them. During 2020, our domestic and international revenues accounted for 90% and 10%, respectively, of total revenue. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Information.”
In the United States, we typically consign our orthobiologics products and consign or loan our spinal implant sets to hospitals and independent sales agents, who in turn deliver them to the hospital for a single surgical procedure or leave them with hospitals that are high volume users for use in multiple procedures. Our spinal implant sets typically contain the instruments, including disposables, and spinal implants required to complete a surgery. 
In international markets, we predominantly sell complete instrument and implant sets to independent stocking distributors, who consign or loan these sets to surgeons. We maintain sales and marketing personnel in France to manage and support our stocking distributors in Europe and use third-party distribution facilities in Belgium and the Netherlands to support European distribution efforts.
We have recently increased, and intend to continue to increase, the quality, size, exclusivity and geographic breadth of our network of independent sales agents in the United States. During 2019 and 2020, we gained representation in parts of the country where we had no representation or were significantly underrepresented. We anticipate adding additional independent sales agents in the United States in 2021. With certain of the new sales agents that we bring on board in territories with a high potential for growth, we focus on entering into relationships in which they carry our spinal implants and/or DBM products exclusively, except with respect to clinical markets that our products do not address. We believe these more exclusive relationships will allow us to grow faster and more cost effectively in these territories over the long term. We also plan to continue to invest in additional instrument sets and marketing and education efforts to support the expansion of our independent sales agent footprint.
To support our expansion efforts in the United States, we have invested more in, and developed comprehensive support for, sales agent and surgeon training and education programs. To this end, we have leveraged the capacity of our hands-on cadaveric training laboratories at our Carlsbad, California and Wayne, Pennsylvania facilities to increase the number of training opportunities for surgeons and sales agents. We believe training and education will help surgeons become adept with our spinal implant products and techniques, thereby improving outcomes for their patients.
We believe the expansion of our U.S. sales efforts will provide us with the opportunity to sustain revenue growth as we continue to penetrate existing and new markets.
Internationally, we intend to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on expanding and strengthening our presence in those markets where we currently have relationships with stocking distributors and to selectively expand into new markets.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from one supplier. Our relationships with suppliers that cannot be replaced without a material expense or delay are governed by written contracts, which are generally supply agreements. These agreements set forth the process by which we order components or raw materials, as applicable, from such suppliers (which process is either on a purchase order basis or based on quarterly or annual forecasts and in some cases require us to purchase minimum amounts) and the related fees for purchasing such components or raw materials. These agreements have terms from one to five years, but in most instances are terminable by us (and in limited 
instances the other party) for convenience, subject to a specified notice period, and are also terminable upon agreement by the parties, by either party upon material breach by the other and by either party if the other party enters bankruptcy. These agreements also outline the rights of each party with respect to quality assurance, inspection and compliance with applicable law and contain what we believe to be customary indemnification provisions for commercial agreements. Each of these agreements is entered into in the ordinary course of our business, and except for our supply agreement with PcoMed, LLC (PcoMed), is immaterial in amount and significance and not a contract upon which our business is substantially dependent. In addition, we endeavor to maintain sufficient inventory of components and raw materials so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
Most of our biomaterial products contain material derived from human or bovine tissue. We only source our raw materials from tissue banks registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). The donors are screened, tested and processed by the tissue banks in accordance with FDA and AATB requirements. Additionally, each donor must pass FDA-specified bacterial and viral testing before raw material is distributed to us for further processing. We receive with each donor lot a certification of the safety of the raw material from the tissue bank’s medical director. As an added safety assurance, each lot of bone is released into the manufacturing process only after our quality assurance microbiologists screen the incoming bone and serology test records. During our manufacturing process, the bone particles are subjected to our proprietary process and terminally sterilized. This process is designed to support the safety and effectiveness of our DBM products.
The collagen used in our collagen ceramic matrix products is derived only from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months old from the United States or New Zealand. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) transmission. Deep flexor tendon is in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission (the same category as milk, for example) and is therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE (an improperly folded protein known as a prion).
Intellectual Property
We seek patent and trademark protection for our key technology, products and product improvements, both in the United States and in select foreign countries. When we determine appropriate, we plan to continue to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. In general, however, we do not rely solely on our patent and trademark estate to provide us with any significant competitive advantages as it relates to our existing product lines.
We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position. In an effort to protect our proprietary information, we typically require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute agreements that provide that confidential information developed or provided to the individual by us or on our behalf during their relationship with us must be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances.
IsoTis OrthoBiologics, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, owns a group of patents related to the reverse-phase carrier and Accell process and materials. This patent group protects the Accell family of DBM products. The patents in this group expire over time through 2024.
We licensed three U.S. patents related to certain of our pedicle screw systems from Dr. Thomas T. Haider. The license agreement, as amended, expired when the last-to-expire licensed patent expired in December 2016. Sales of the products covered under this license agreement represented approximately 5% of our total revenue in 2020.

Competition
The global orthobiologics and spine markets are highly competitive. We face significant competition in both markets from the spine divisions of large multinational medical device companies, established companies focused solely or primarily on spine, as well as smaller, emerging players focused on product innovation. These competitors are focused on bringing new technologies to market and acquiring technologies and technology licenses that directly compete with our products or have potential product advantages that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.
Our primary competitors in the combined orthobiologics and spinal implant markets include Alphatec Spine, Baxter, Bioventus, Cerapedics, DePuy Synthes Spine (a Johnson & Johnson company), Globus Medical, Medtronic, NuVasive, Orthofix, Stryker, Surgalign, XTANT Medical, Zimmer-Biomet and many smaller, biologically-focused companies.
We anticipate that our currently marketed products and any future marketed products will be subject to intense competition. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do, which could make scaling our business challenging. In addition, these competitors have more tenured relationships with parties in distribution channels and we anticipate they will continue to dedicate significant resources to marketing and distributing their products and to developing and commercializing competing products. Our ability to compete will depend on our ability to launch innovative new products that demonstrate superior clinical outcomes.
Regulation
We are a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices and a tissue bank, and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal governmental agencies and, in some jurisdictions, by state and foreign governmental agencies. The regulations to which we are subject govern the introduction of new medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the design, manufacture, testing, labeling, promotion and sales of devices, record maintenance, the ability to track devices, potential and actual product defect reporting, import and export of devices, and other matters.
The regulatory process of obtaining product approvals and clearances can be onerous and costly. The FDA requires, as a condition to marketing a medical device in the United States, and as applicable based on product type and classification, that we secure a Premarket Notification clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or an approved premarket approval (PMA) application (or PMA supplement). Obtaining these approvals and clearances can take up to several years and may involve preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also require a post-approval clinical trial as a condition of approval.
To perform clinical trials for significant risk devices in the United States on an unapproved product, we are required to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA. The FDA may also require a filing for FDA approval prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or new indications for existing products. Moreover, after clearance/approval is given, if the product is shown to be hazardous or defective, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have the power to withdraw the clearance or require us to change the device, its manufacturing process or its labeling, to supply additional proof of its safety and effectiveness or to recall, repair, replace or refund the cost of the medical device.
The FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA), which includes the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012, as well as other medical device provisions, went into effect October 1, 2012. This includes performance goals and user fees paid to the FDA by medical device companies when they register and list with the FDA and when they apply to market a device in the United States. The FDASIA also imposes additional requirements regarding FDA Establishment Registration and Listing of Medical Devices. All U.S. and foreign manufacturers must have an FDA Establishment Registration and complete Medical Device listings for sales in the United States.
We manufacture medical devices derived from human tissue (demineralized bone tissue). The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). An HCT/P is a product containing, or consisting of, human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples include bone, ligament, skin and cornea. Some HCT/Ps fall within the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the FDCA. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval from the FDA.
Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice 
when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting.
The AATB has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Accreditation is voluntary, but compliance with these standards is a requirement to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits for tissue banking in California, Florida, New York, Maryland, and other states that require specific licensing or registration.
National Organ Transplant Act. Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to certain costs associated with processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical education expenses, and costs associated with development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our future revenue and profitability.
Postmarket Requirements. After a device is cleared or approved for commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s Quality System Regulations which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of medical devices; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for off-label uses; the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or that a malfunction occurred which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence; and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field corrective actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA.
We are also required to register with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing sites are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements and other legal requirements for labeling and promotion. If the FDA believes that a company is not in compliance with applicable regulations, it may issue a warning letter, institute proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a recall order, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against that company, its officers or its employees and may recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Similar requirements to those outlined above also apply to tissue products.
Medical device regulations also are in effect in many of the countries in which we do business outside the United States. These laws range from comprehensive medical device approval and quality system requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simpler requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. Under the previous European Medical Devices Directive and its replacement the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) EU 2017/745, medical devices were required to meet the requirements and receive CE Mark Certification prior to marketing in the EU and European Economic Area. CE Mark Certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, comprehensive technical documentation and data on the product, which are then reviewed by a Notified Body for most products. A Notified Body is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the requirements established by each CE marking regulation. ISO 13485 is a recognized international quality standard designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries have instituted regulations regarding medical devices. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation, often including clinical reports for our products, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements. A recognized Notified Body or government agency audits our facilities annually to verify our compliance with these standards.
In the EU, our products that contain human-derived tissue, including demineralized bone material, are not medical devices as defined in the MDR. They are also not medicinal products as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC. Today, tissue regulations, if applicable, are different from one EU member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized 
regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the EU, the approval process for human-derived cell or tissue-based medical products may be extensive, lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable.
Certain countries, as well as the EU, have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal sources. Regulatory authorities are particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes BSE. These regulations affect our biomaterial products for the spine, which contain material derived from bovine tissue. Although we take steps designed to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our products, or a movement away from bovine-derived products because of an outbreak of BSE could have a material and adverse effect on our business or our ability to expand our business. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations - Certain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.”
We are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws that regulate how companies in the health care industry may market their products to hospitals and health care professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products. The delivery of our products is subject to regulation regarding reimbursement, and federal healthcare laws apply when a customer submits a claim for a product that is reimbursed under a federally funded healthcare program. These rules require that we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices and customer discount arrangements. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations - Oversight of the medical device industry might affect the way may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.”
Our international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, import-export, laws regarding transactions in foreign countries, the FCPA and local anti-bribery and other laws regarding interactions with healthcare professionals. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases prohibit, United States companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices in foreign countries.
Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. We are subject to country-specific, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products. We believe that our environmental, health and safety (EHS) procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by the controlling laws and regulations. However, risk of accidental releases or injury from these materials is possible. These risks are managed to minimize or eliminate associated business impacts. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for damages that may result, and any liability could exceed our resources. We could be subject to a regulatory shutdown of a facility that could prevent the distribution and sale of products manufactured there for a significant period of time and we could suffer a casualty loss that could require a shutdown of the facility in order to repair it, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Although we continuously strive to maintain full compliance with respect to all applicable global EHS laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs to fully comply with future laws and regulations, and our operations, business or assets may be impacted.
In addition to the above regulations, we are and may be subject to regulation under country-specific federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding record keeping, and the maintenance of personal information, including personal health information. We also are subject to other present, and could be subject to possible future, local, state, federal and foreign regulations.
Reimbursement Overview
Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private payors, such as indemnity insurers, employer group health insurance programs and managed care plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the device. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these third-party and private payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the device is furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes and budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party and private payors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products, as a result of these changes may affect our customers’ ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare 
regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers’ healthcare services may significantly affect our operations and revenue.
