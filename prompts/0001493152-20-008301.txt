Overview
 
We are a household appliances and related domestic appliances products company in the PRC. Our principal business activity is the provision of household appliances products and related domestic appliances products. Our products improve the home lifestyle and living solutions experience, predominately through power savings, resources efficiencies and functionalities of products. We sell our products to corporate customers, retail customers and independent distributors predominately in the PRC and intend to expand our business in other countries around the world. Our products are typically used in a home setting of consumers of all demographics on a daily basis and meet the convenience-oriented preferences of today’s consumer across a broad range of household activities. We help make daily life easier through a broad range of products that offer multi-purpose functions. Our diverse product portfolio includes televisions, air-conditioners, laundry appliances, refrigerators and freezers, cooking appliances, dishwashers, mixers and other small domestic appliances. Our products are known for their quality, which is recognized by our consumers, retail customers, and corporate customers alike. We believe our customers know they can rely on our trusted brand. These factors generate loyalty which empowers us to develop and launch new products that expand application scenarios and transforms our product portfolio into the smart household appliances category.
 
Our business has three main divisions and revenue streams, namely, (i) sales of household appliances and related domestic appliances products, (ii) consultancy, and (iii) integration and installation services. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the PRC. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was $5.5 million, and our gross profit was approximately $1.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenue was $5,084, and our gross profit was approximately $796. We conduct our business through Shenzhen Wiseman Smart Industrial Co., Limited and its subsidiaries which are founded in the PRC and our Hong Kong subsidiary, Wiseman Global Limited (“Wiseman HK”).
 
Our Strategies
 
We have achieved rapid growth since our inception in 2018. While making significant long-term investments in human capital, research and development, brand-building, and distribution. Our continued investment in and expansion of the Wiseman brand, distribution, and product offerings will further increase opportunities to acquire new customers and expand relationships with our existing customer base.
 
We believe we are creating a meaningful future customer asset. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 26% of customers who have purchased at least once since Wiseman’s inception in 2018 have made repeat purchases. This demonstrates that customers are returning to Wiseman to expand the number of products they own, not merely to replace them. We expect this rate to grow further as we expand our product offerings and increase our brand awareness.

Increase brand awareness and equity to acquire new customers.
 
Increasing brand awareness and growing favorable brand equity among consumers has been, and remains, central to our growth. We believe brand familiarity and preference will continue to have a significant role in winning customers and the decision to buy household appliances and related domestic appliances products.
 
Our investment in marketing initiatives from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 totaled $59,161. We drive brand awareness through a combination of sophisticated, multi-layered marketing programs, word-of-mouth referrals, product showcase in our Shenzhen showroom, retail placement expansion, and ongoing product usage. A core principle of our brand growth strategy is offering customers increased ways to engage with our products through increased distributions to authorized distributors and retail stores and integration of our products with renovation companies’ and construction contractors’ projects.
 
Expand network of retail stores placements and authorized distributors.
 
We complement our online presence by expanding our physical retail stores placements to deliver additional consumer touchpoints and increase sales and margin. A greater retail stores placements presence helps us to not only increase consumer awareness and education, but also to offer convenient products showcase, multiple purchase options, and flexibility in delivery. As of December 31, 2019, our products were (i) placed in over 5 retail stores; (ii) supplied to 10 domestic distributors and 1 overseas distributor; and (iii) supplied to 2 authorized distributors.
 
We plan to continue the introduce Wiseman products into more retail stores in order to strengthen our footprint in the PRC, while selectively entering into new international markets. We believe that our current growth strategy is cost efficient and allows us to scale faster in the retail sector in the PRC and we believe there is a significant opportunity for us to further expand our retail stores presence through retail stores placement.
 
Expand domestically and internationally.
 
We intend to increase the brand awareness of our products in the PRC and overseas markets by means of marketing and increase the number of authorized distributors and distributors. Our efforts to enhance our brand recognition will also go beyond marketing activities to establish our own brand eventually as a comprehensive smart household appliances brand with increasing diverse products and service offerings. For example, as part of our smart household ecosystem initiative, we plan to introduce our branded “Wiseman Home System” in fourth quarter of 2020 which will connect most of the Wiseman household appliances and allow a user to control Wiseman household appliances remotely through an application developed by our Company.
 
Currently, our household appliances products are predominately sold in the PRC. We also sell our household appliances products to overseas customers in Cambodia and Hong Kong. For example, in Cambodia we sell our products through a distribution channel. With the establishment of our Cambodia office in 2019, due to its proximity to the Southeast Asian markets, we will be able to expand our business into the Vietnam and Thailand markets. We intend to replicate the rapid expansion we have achieved in the PRC by establishing relationships with established third-party overseas distributors and through retail stores placements as part of marketing and brand promotion efforts. We will also consider to collaborate with other local partners in overseas markets where it would be efficient to do so.
 
Strengthen our in-house research and development to adapt to changes in technology.
 
We must keep up with technological developments in order to stay ahead of our competitors. As such, we will continue to strengthen our research and development, and apply various new home technologies and product solutions to further develop the next generation smart household appliances ecosystem with our products. As part of our smart household ecosystem initiative in fourth quarter of 2020, we will also continue to develop our Wiseman Home System to enhance its (i) connectivity of our products; (ii) information distribution, data analysis and processing; and (iii) visualization capabilities of the system to enable our products to be centrally monitored and managed remotely, in order to adapt to different needs and conditions more efficiently.

We sell the majority of our products, with or without customization, under our brand name “Wiseman”, to domestic customers in the PRC, and to overseas customers in Cambodia and Hong Kong. We intend to expand our business in other countries around the world. Our customers are primarily corporate enterprises and retail customers. While we sell the majority of our household appliances and related domestic appliances products under our “Wiseman” brand name, we do not operate any production facilities. We source our branded household appliances and related domestic appliances products from OEMs certified by us. For details of our contracting arrangement and quality control of our OEMs, please refer to the sections headed “Our Suppliers and OEMs” and “Quality Control.”
 
Consultancy
 
Based on our expertise and know-how on operations, we provide advice on the integration and installation of our household appliances products and related domestic appliances products to our corporate customers in respect of hotels, shopping malls and/or restaurants settings. Some of these advice includes floor layout design and input, kitchen design and input, integration application etc. Further, we also provide advice to our distributors on product distributions in retail stores. We receive consultancy fees based on the complexity and workload on the projects.
Integration and Installation Services
 
As part of our income diversification strategy, we are actively increasing our revenue opportunities in the integration and installation services. We believe the provision of integration and installation services as an after-sales service can supplement our business. Our services involve the installation of our household appliances products and related domestic appliance products into a designated environment to provide better living solutions and/or to create a smart household ecosystem. We have a labor team for our integration and installation services. However, in the future, depending on the size and complexity of a service project, we may engage subcontractor for a service project for internal resources efficiency and cost efficiency reasons.

As at December 31, 2019, the Company has 10 domestic distributors, 1 overseas distributor, and has entered into 2 domestic authorized distribution contracts. Our distributors and authorized distributors distribute our products in their retail stores network or distribution networks.
 
Further, we charge fee for integration and installation services to our customers, in particular hotels, renovation companies, construction contractors, to provide integration and installation services of our products in hotel, shopping mall and/or restaurants owned by our corporate customers. Billings to the customers are generally based on the complexity and workload on the projects. The integration and installation services contracts typically include a single performance obligation.
 
Our Suppliers and OEMs 
 
We are generally not dependent upon any one source for our household appliances and related domestic appliances products essential to our business. We source our household appliances and related domestic appliances products for our sales orders and sell the majority of them under our brand name “Wiseman.” We do not maintain any facilities to produce our products. We source and outsource the production of our products from and to OEMs certified by us.
 
We typically seek quotations from our OEMs and other suppliers when we receive a sales order from existing and prospective customers. After we enter into contracts with customers and obtain the specifications and/or functionalities required by our customers, we confirm the orders with our OEMs that possess products with the relevant specifications and/or functionalities and purchase the products.
 
We have a labor team for our integration and installation services. However, depending on the size and complexity of a service project, we may engage subcontractor for a service project. In that case, we are accountable to our customers for the work performed on an integration and installation services project, including those carried out by our subcontractors. In order to manage our subcontractors, our current labor team for our integration and installation services will work as the in-house project management personnel to supervise the on-site work of our subcontractors. To date, we have not entered into any agreement with any subcontractor.
 
Distribution
 
We utilize two routes of distribution to deliver our products to our corporate customers and retail customers. In many cases, we ship directly from our third-party OEMs to our corporate customers. We typically order products from our OEMs and other suppliers after we receive sales order from our customers, this enable us to optimize truckloads and reduce inventory level for all of our product categories. We normally deliver our products to our retail customer upon request or they choose to pick up the product from our storeroom or show room.
Research and Development 
 
We believe our future success depends on our ability to develop our brand into a comprehensive smart household appliances brand with increasing diverse products and service offerings. Our research and development team and our management team co-lead the products development processes. We take a user centric approach to product development. Our research and development team has responded effectively to technological changes, and is driving continued innovation to unleash the potential of the household appliances industry. We are currently in the process of seeking for a prospective company to form a research and development partnership to further develop our Wiseman Home System in order to reduce our research and development cost.
 
Based on our current scale, we have a professional research and development team led by our top researcher, Mr Xiao whom has over 10 years of experience in household appliances industry and smart hardware development, software and platform development. Our research and development team is primarily based at our headquarters in Shenzhen, PRC. To date, the research and development cost is insignificant.

Seasonality
 
Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our products. While seasonality has not been particularly prevalent in our historical results of operations due to the rapid growth of our business, we generally expect to experience higher sales in the second and fourth quarters of each year, primarily attributable to the major shopping festivals across online e-commerce platforms such as “618,” “Singles’ Day” and “Double Twelve,” which are highly popular among Chinese consumers.
Competition 
 
We operate across the household appliances economy, including in the television, air-conditioner, laundry appliance, refrigerator and freezer, cooking appliance, dishwasher, mixer and other small domestic appliances industries. We compete primarily on brand awareness, product quality and breadth, price, and product performance. In general, we compete in a diverse and fragmented market of household appliances retail chains and online retailers in the PRC such as Shenzhen Yitoa Intelligent Control Co. Ltd., a company listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (Shenzhen Stock Exchange, 300131), Guangdong Anjubao Digital Technology Co. Ltd., a company listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (Shenzhen Stock Exchange, 300155), Aishida Co. Ltd., a company listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (Shenzhen Stock Exchange, 002403), and Town Ray Holdings Limited, a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (Hong Kong Stock Exchange, 1692). Moreover, our customer base includes large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services and prices. We believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products, building our brand awareness, improving product quality and breadth, product performance, offering a competitive price, lowering costs, and taking other efficiency-enhancing measures.
Quality Control
 
We carefully select our OEMs and other suppliers. We also closely monitor the production by our OEMs and other suppliers. We have developed an evaluation system to assess our OEMs and other suppliers regularly based on a set of parameters, such as product quality and timeliness of delivery. We maintain an internal list of approved OEMs and other suppliers. We obtain quotations from different OEMs for each sales order and select them by taking into account the functionalities of products, their track record, scale of operation, product quality, reputation and price. Upon completion of a sales order, we conduct an evaluation and performance review for our future reference by our quality control and research and development personnel.
Sales and Marketing 
 
Our procurement, sales and marketing team is comprised of 4 employees and they are responsible for procurement, sales, marketing and customer service. In search for prospective customers, we actively invest in driving traffic to our e-commerce website, marketing our products to consumers and building our brand. Further, we leased a showroom in Shenzhen, PRC to exhibit and promote our products to existing and prospective customers which in turn may create more business opportunities and further strengthen the corporate image. We did not incur any sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales revenue of 1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe the increase in sale and marketing expenses contributed to our revenue growth in 2019 and we will continue to invest more in 2020. This improvement reflects more efficient marketing returns as Wiseman expands its product offerings in existing and new categories, increased customer awareness, a higher returning customer mix, growth in our distribution partnership and retail placements by distributors and more effective marketing models as we continue to improve our understanding of our customers.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2020, we had 17 employees (excluding our Directors). The following table sets forth the number of employees by function:
 

Function | Number of employees | 
-----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+---
Procurement, Sales and marketing | | 4 
Quality control and research and development | | 7 
Management, human resources and other administration | | 4 
Finance and accounting | | 2 
Total | | 17

Properties
 
Our corporate headquarters, which is located in Shenzhen, PRC, is a leased property of approximately 150 square meters. In addition, we currently lease 5 properties, ranging from approximately 150 to 2,300 square meters, in Shenzhen, PRC and Cambodia, which primarily carry out the function of a showroom, storage room and an overseas representative office, respectively.
 
We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. Our leases will expire from 2020 to 2024. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs. If we require additional space, we expect to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
 
Inventory
 
We generally maintain limited inventory of our products. We order products for our orders on an as-needed basis. Where our products are ordered by our customers, we place orders with our OEMs upon receipt of orders from our customers. Occasionally, we order extra inventory for the best-selling products if we expect a higher demand from potential customers.
Intellectual Property
 
We consider trademarks, patents and copyrights to protect our intellectual property rights critical to our success. We are the registered owner of 1 trademark in Hong Kong. We are the registered owner of 10 computer software copyrights in the PRC. We are currently in the process of transferring an additional 9 trademarks from Shenzhen Wiseman Smart Technology Group Co., Limited, which is owned 66% by our chief executive officer and Director, Mr. Lai Jinpeng. We have recently discussed with Mr. Xiao to acquire his 7 patents in the PRC as we see strategic benefits in incorporating these patents into our Wiseman Home System. We are also the registered owner of one domain name, namely “wisemanglobal.cn.”
Insurance
 
We purchase pension insurance for our employees and general commercial insurance for our workers pursuant to relevant PRC laws and regulations. We do not have any third-party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations. Such insurance is not mandatory according to the laws and regulations of the PRC. We believe this practice is consistent with customary subcontracting industry standards adopted by other project management operators in the PRC. As part of our strategy, if we engage subcontractors to work on our integration and installation services projects, we will require them to purchase insurance for our projects. As at December 31, 2019, we have not engaged with any subcontractor.
Warranty
 
We generally provide a standard warranty for our products. The warranty period is typically 12 months upon delivery and inspection of the products in accordance with PRC national warranty standard. Our warranty includes the repair works for the non-functional products, and the costs of the component parts are not included in our warranty. The determination of our warranty requirements is based on actual historical experience. To date, we have not incurred a material warranty expense on any products. However, as a policy, provisions for warranty liability will be made during the period in which a provision for warranty liability becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. We consider the cost of the repair work is immaterial, as such, there is no provision for warranty liability made for during the warranty period.

Legal Proceedings
 
We are not subjected to nor engaged in any litigation, arbitration or claim of material importance, and no litigation, arbitration or claim of material importance is known to us to be pending or threatened by or against our Company that would have a material adverse effect on our Company’s results of operations or financial condition.
