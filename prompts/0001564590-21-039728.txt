ITEM 1. Business
General
 Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value flat panel detector solutions, replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company’s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and “engineered solutions” based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
 Our fiscal year 2021 began on May 31, 2020 and ended on May 29, 2021, our fiscal year 2020 began on June 2, 2019 and ended on May 30, 2020 and our fiscal year 2019 began on June 3, 2018 and ended on June 1, 2019. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.
 Company Response to COVID-19
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Thereafter, most U.S. states imposed “shelter in place” directives on their populations to stem the spread of COVID-19 and similar restrictive measures were taken by governments across the world.
 The shelter in place directives generally required the closure of businesses that did not provide essential functions. The Company was considered a critical supplier of products to healthcare and critical infrastructure businesses. Further, several of our largest customers mandated that we continue to supply parts so as not to disrupt the supply chain and their ability to serve critical industries. As such, the Company qualified as an “Essential Business” and the Company continued our manufacturing and distribution operations throughout 2021. Our top priority was ensuring the health and safety of our employees and, accordingly, we undertook measures such as limiting the number of people in any one of our facilities by requiring only employees who could not perform their work remotely to physically work in a Company US-based facility. The Company advised all other employees that could perform their job functions remotely to do so. As such, the Company’s operations remained operational.
 The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its effects continue to evolve. As such, the full magnitude that the pandemic, and the steps taken to prevent and/or mitigate its spread, will have on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations is uncertain. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the duration and spread of the pandemic, the extent, speed and effectiveness of worldwide containment and vaccination efforts and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers and suppliers. Our ability to meet customer demands for products may be impaired or, similarly, our customers may experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19 and its effects. Reduced demand for products or impaired ability to meet customer demand (including disruptions at our transportation service providers or vendors) could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial performance. There was a decline in PMT sales during the first three months of fiscal 2021, a decline in Healthcare sales during the first six months of fiscal 2021 and a decline in Canvys sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2021. The majority of these declines

in sales were related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. While we had some COVID-19 related component delays impacting new product development schedules, we did not experience a major interruption in our supply chain. Management continues to monitor the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. Given the ever-evolving nature of the pandemic and the continued global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not presently able to fully estimate the effects of COVID-19 on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity for fiscal year 2022.
 Company Response to CARES Act
 On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The CARES Act included provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified, improvement property. As of May 29, 2021, the Company deferred $0.9 million of employer-side social security tax payments. The Company has estimated and recorded the overall effects of the CARES Act and does not anticipate a material change.
 Geography
 We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.
 Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 is set forth in Note 9, Segment and Geographic Information, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
 Power and Microwave Technologies Group
 Power and Microwave Technologies Group (“PMT”) combines our core engineered solutions capabilities, power grid and microwave tube business with new disruptive RF, Wireless and Power technologies. As a designer, manufacturer, technology partner and authorized distributor, PMT’s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities on a global basis. We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair—all through our existing global infrastructure. PMT’s focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in 5G, alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar and radiation oncology. PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
 PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and RF, Microwave and power components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, RF and wireless and industrial power applications. Among the suppliers PMT supports are Amperex, CDE, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MACOM, National, NJRC, Ohmite, Qorvo, Thales, Toshiba and Vishay.
 PMT’s inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment and designing in new technologies. PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology. While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, PMT is increasing its market share. PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases and extended lead times. As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
 PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights that often include global coverage. The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches that are not cured within a reasonable period. Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
 PMT’s suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers. For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies and Disclosures, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
