ITEM 1. BUSINESS     
Company Overview         
 
The principal business of LSC Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (“LSC Communications,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”) is to offer a broad scope of traditional and digital print, print-related services and office products. 
 
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in Items 1, Business, and 7, Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are defined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
 

Merger Agreement 
 
On October 30, 2018, the Company entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Quad/Graphics, Inc. (“Quad”), QLC Merger Sub, Inc. and LSC Communications, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, LSC Communications would be merged with QLC Merger Sub, Inc., and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quad.
 
On July 22, 2019, Quad and LSC Communications entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Quad agreed to pay LSC Communications the Regulatory Approval Reverse Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of $45 million in cash on the business day following the date of the Letter Agreement. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $26 million associated with the Merger Agreement, of which $5 million was incurred in 2018.  Except for certain indemnification obligations of Quad related to LSC Communications assisting Quad with the financing under the Merger Agreement, the parties also agreed to release each other from any and all claims, counterclaims, demands, proceedings, actions, causes of action, orders, obligations, damages, debts, costs, expenses and other liabilities whatsoever and howsoever arising pursuant to or in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement.
 
Going Concern
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  Based on final results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company concluded it was not in compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Ratio contained in the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.  The noncompliance occurred on the last day of the fourth quarter due to the following: the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeded the maximum level permitted and the Company’s Minimum Interest Ratio was below the minimum level permitted.  On March 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement with lenders constituting a majority under the Credit Agreement that governs the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. The Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement waives the defaults or events of default that have occurred as a result of the financial covenant noncompliance on December 31, 2019 and prevents the lenders from directing the Administrative Agent to accelerate the debt or exercise other remedies as a result of certain other potential defaults or events of default which may occur under the Credit Agreement (the “Potential Defaults”) through the period ended May 14, 2020 (such period, the “Forbearance Period”).  The Potential Defaults include potential breaches of the Company’s financial covenants with respect to the first quarter of 2020, failure to make principal and interest payments related to the Term Loan Facility, failure to deliver audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 without a going concern qualification or exception, and failure to provide notice with respect to the Potential Defaults.  The Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement contains certain covenants and requirements, and failure to comply with these covenants and requirements could result in the termination of the Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement (and the Forbearance Period) prior to its stated term.  Following the end of the Forbearance Period, the lenders may choose not to provide a full waiver of the Potential Defaults, should any occur.  The Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a waiver fee of 0.30% of the Aggregate Exposure of the Consenting Lenders as of the effective date of the Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement.  Should any of the Potential Defaults occur, unless the Company obtains an extension or another waiver, upon the termination of the Forbearance Period, the Company’s debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility could be in default and could be accelerated by lenders, which would require the Company to pay all amounts outstanding and could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 3



The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company entering into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, including revised covenants, or obtaining financing to replace the current facility, as well as continuing profitable operations, continuing to meet its obligations, and continuing to repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company has evaluated its plans to alleviate this doubt, which may include obtaining amended terms from its current lenders to allow for sufficient flexibility in the financial covenants after giving consideration to the Company’s current operations and strategic plans, or evaluating strategic alternatives in order to reduce the Company’s indebtedness.  As of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, such plans cannot yet be considered probable (as defined by ASC 205-40, “Going Concern”) of occurring.  Negotiations with our lenders may require the Company to raise additional capital and/or pursue the sale of non-core assets to reduce existing debt. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans to refinance, to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms or to sell non-strategic assets, when required or if at all. If such plans are not realized, the Company may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Management anticipates incurring certain one-time expenses, which may be significant, during 2020 relating to the plans it may pursue to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
 
The consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements includes an emphasis of matter paragraph related to the substantial doubt surrounding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Competitive Environment
 
According to the December 2019 IBIS World industry report “Printing in the U.S.,” estimated total annual printing industry revenue is approximately $80 billion, of which approximately $13 billion relates to our core segments of the print market and an additional approximately $33 billion pertains to related segments of the print market in which we are able to offer certain products. Despite consolidation in recent years, including several acquisitions completed by LSC Communications, the industry remains highly fragmented and LSC Communications is one of the largest players in our segment of the print market.  The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and LSC Communications remains diligent in proactively identifying plant consolidation opportunities to keep our capacity in line with demand.  Across the Company’s range of print products and services, competition is based primarily on the ability to deliver products for the lowest total cost, a factor driven not only by price, but also by materials and distribution costs.  We expect that prices for print products and services will continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years.   
 
7


Value-added services, such as LSC Communications’ co-mail, logistics and supply chain management offerings, enable customers to lower their total costs. Technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet technologies, continue to impact the market for our products and services.  
 
The Company’s product and service offerings have been impacted by the following:
 
 
• | The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products. Digital technologies have impacted printed magazines as advertising spending continues to move from print to electronic media. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Catalogs have experienced volume reductions as our customers allocate more of their spending to online resources and also face competition from online retailers resulting in retailer compression.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company has seen an unprecedented drop in demand for magazines and catalogs in 2019, with the faster pace of decline in demand primarily due to the accelerated impact of digital disruption of demand for printed materials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Educational books within the college market continue to be impacted by electronic substitution and other trends. The K-12 educational sector continues to be focused on increasing digital distribution but there has been inconsistent adoption across school systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-book substitution has impacted overall consumer print trade book volume, although e-book adoption rates have stabilized and industry-wide print book volume has been growing in recent years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic communication and transaction technology has also continued to drive electronic substitution in directory printing, in part driven by cost pressures at key customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The future impact of technology on our business is difficult to predict; however, it is likely to result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, we have made targeted acquisitions and investments in our existing business to offer customers innovative services and solutions. Such acquisitions and investments include the acquisitions of Print Logistics in 2018 and Clark Group, Quality Park, Publishers Press, CREEL, Fairrington, and HudsonYards in 2017, which expanded our logistics, printing, digital, office products, and premedia capabilities, and Continuum in 2016, which expanded our print management capabilities.  These acquisitions and investments further secure our position as a technology leader in the industry.
 
Technological advancement and innovation continues to affect the overall demand for most of the products in our Office Products segment.  However, the overall market for our products remains large and we believe share growth is attainable.  We compete against a range of both domestic and international competitors in each of our product categories within the segment.  Due to the increasing percentage of private label products in the market, resellers have created a highly competitive environment where purchasing decisions are based largely on price, quality and the supplier’s ability to service the customer.  As consumer preferences shift towards private label, resellers have increased the pressure on suppliers to better differentiate their product offering, oftentimes through product exclusivity, product innovation and development of private label products.  We have experienced robust growth within our e-commerce channel, where a significant majority of our sales are branded products.
 
We have implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure and improve efficiency, including the restructuring, reorganization and integration of operations and streamlining of administrative and support activities.  Future cost reduction initiatives are likely to include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities.  Implementing such initiatives might result in future restructuring or impairment charges, which may be substantial.  We also review our operations and management structure on a regular basis to appropriately balance risks and opportunities to maximize efficiencies and to support our long-term strategic goals. 
 
During late 2018 and early 2019, the Company performed a comprehensive review of the Company’s entire operations to identify new revenue opportunities and cost savings.  This review covered substantially all aspects of the Company – both operational and support functions – and involved key personnel from throughout the organization.  The resulting revenue opportunities and cost savings initiatives were approved by senior management in the first quarter of 2019 and are expected to be implemented over the next three years.  While the Company realized the benefits beginning in 2019 and expects to realize benefits at various points over the next three years, the Company incurred $10 million of expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 relating to the implementation of certain identified initiatives.  As the Company continues to implement the identified initiatives, the Company expects to incur additional expense; however, the Company expects the resulting benefits (additional revenue and/or cost savings) to significantly exceed the additional expense.

Seasonality
 
Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets served by LSC Communications. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy.  
Raw Materials
 
We negotiate with suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies.  The primary raw materials we use in our printed products are paper and ink.  We negotiate with paper suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies and use a wide variety of paper grades and formats. In addition, a substantial amount of paper used in our printed products is supplied directly by customers.  Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated financial results.  Generally, customers directly absorb the impact of changing prices on customer-supplied paper.  For paper that we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our customers. We entered into a paper consignment agreement at the end of 2019 that will encompass substantially all of LSC Communications’ purchased paper by mid-2020 to reduce our working capital.
 Contractual arrangements and industry practice should support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so.  Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on customers’ demand for printed products.  We also resell waste paper and other print-related by-products and may be impacted by changes in prices for these by-products.
 
We use a wide variety of ink formulations and colors in our manufacturing processes. Variations in the cost and supply of certain ink formulations may affect our consolidated financial results. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to try to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our ink requirements, including entering into a long term supply arrangement with a single supplier for a substantial portion of our ink supply.  Certain contractual protections exist in our relationship with such supplier, such as price and quality protections and an ability to seek alternative sources of ink if the supplier breaches or is unable to perform certain of its obligations, which are intended to mitigate the risk of ink-related supply disruptions.
 
The primary materials used in the Office Products segment are paper, steel and polypropylene substrates. We negotiate with leading paper, plastic and steel suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies.  All of these materials are available from a number of domestic and international suppliers and we are not dependent upon any single supplier for any of these materials.  We believe that adequate supply is available for each of these materials for the foreseeable future, although higher paper prices may have an impact on demand for our products.
 
Changes in material prices, including paper, may impact the Company’s operating margins as there may be a lag between when the Company experiences the changes and when they are absorbed by our customers. 
 
Except for our long-term supply arrangement regarding ink and paper consignment agreement, we do not consider ourselves to be dependent upon any single vendor as a source of supply for our businesses, and we believe that sufficient alternative sources for the same, similar or alternative products are available.
 
Changes in the price of raw materials, crude oil and other energy costs impact our manufacturing costs. Crude oil and energy prices continue to be volatile. Should prices increase, we generally cannot pass on to customers the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs.  We do enter into fixed price contracts for a portion of our natural gas purchases to mitigate the impact of changes in energy prices.  We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.
 

Customers
 
Our printed products service retailers, including catalogers and merchandisers, and publishers of magazines, books and directories. Our customer base includes eight of the top ten catalogers in the United States, eight of the top ten magazine publishers in the United States, and all of the top ten book publishers based in North America.  Our printed products are distributed through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) or foreign postal services or to our customers by direct shipment, typically in bulk, to customer facilities and warehouses.   
 9



Our Office Products segment primarily services office superstores, office supply wholesalers, independent contract stationers, mass merchandisers and retailers and e-commerce resellers. The products that make up our Office Products segment are distributed to our customers by direct shipment, typically in bulk, to customer facilities and warehouses.
 
For each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales.   
 

Technology, Research and Development
 
The Company has a broad portfolio of technology capabilities that are utilized in the delivery of products and services to our customers. We believe that proprietary technology is required where it will provide a competitive advantage or where the desired technology is not readily available in the marketplace, and, as such, our proprietary technology portfolio contains an array of applications and technological capabilities that were developed to perform different functions, including storefront, digital asset management and distribution, manufacturing systems, warehousing, logistics and list management services and data analytics solutions. Our technology strategy is focused on the continued investment in key technologies that support services and solutions that allow for creation, management, production, distribution and analytics of publisher content in multi-channels to maximize their distribution and return for each title. We are also focusing our technology capabilities on developments that will allow us to pursue strategic relationships and expanded services, such as our full supply chain management offering within our book platform.  Our continued activities in our Unified Technology Platform aligns investments across several offerings to support publishers including; order to cash for publishing, digital analytics offered through Harvest View, anti-piracy for publishers through our IntercepTag℠ solution and integrated warehouse offerings in our book fulfillment platform complementing our offset and digital print capabilities. To implement our research and development strategy, we expect to primarily invest in the maintenance and enhancement of our technology footprint within our facilities and in development activities that allow us to create new and differentiating technology capabilities.
Cybersecurity
 
Our cybersecurity program is designed to meet the needs and expectations of our customers who entrust us with certain sensitive business information. Our infrastructure and technology, expansive and highly trained workforce and comprehensive security and compliance program make us qualified to safely process, store and protect this customer information. 
 
Our infrastructure and technology security capabilities are bolstered by our relationship with a leading data center services provider. Furthermore, our networks are monitored by intrusion detection services around the clock, and our systems and applications are routinely tested for vulnerabilities and are operated under a strict patch management program.
 
We employ a highly skilled IT workforce to implement our cybersecurity programs and to handle specific security responsibilities. As a result of annual mandatory security awareness training, our IT workforce is qualified to address security and compliance-related issues as they arise. Additionally, all of our IT employees are carefully screened, undergo a thorough background check and are bound by a nondisclosure agreement that details such employee’s security and legal responsibilities with regards to information handling. We believe our security and compliance team also diminishes the risk of system compromise and data exposure by rapidly and effectively addressing security incidents as they arise.   
 

Intellectual Property 
 
We consider patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important to our business. We own over 140 patents worldwide, the majority of which are concentrated in our Office Products segment (utility and design patents), with the remainder falling into the following categories: 

• | Printing and binding patents: relate to manufacturing processes and systems used in the production of books, magazines and catalogs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Co-mailing patents: relate to combining printed publications in an efficient manner to achieve postal savings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New media patents: relate to methods for creating and formatting digital content for electronic publications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Office Products patents primarily relate to binders, notebooks, filing systems, forms, and envelopes.
 
10


We also own approximately 350 trademarks worldwide, the majority of which are concentrated within our Office Products segment. Several of our most significant trademarks include registrations for the Adams, Ampad, Cardinal Brands, Oxford, Pendaflex, Quality Park, and TOPS office products brands. Additionally, we own the rights to a group of trademarks relating to our e-media publishing services, such as Newsstand™, LibreDigital™, LibreMarket™, LibrePublish™, and LibreAccess™.
 
While we consider our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our profitability and operations are dependent upon any single patent, trademark or other proprietary right. 
 

Environmental Compliance
 
Our operations are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites and health and safety matters. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Additionally, the Superfund regulation (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites) imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party. We are committed to complying with these and all other applicable environmental, health, and safety laws, and in order to reduce the risk of non-compliance, we maintain an Environmental, Health and Safety management system that includes an appropriate policy and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, and other measures. 
 
While it is our policy to conduct our global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements, from time to time, our properties, products or operations may be affected by environmental issues. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  
 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 20,000 total employees in the global workforce, of which approximately 16,800 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 3,200 were in international locations.  Of the U.S. and international employees, approximately 3% and 51%, respectively, were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
