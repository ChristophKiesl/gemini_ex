Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to treat patients suffering from rare seizure disorders. Our clinical stage product candidate, ganaxolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA that is being developed in formulations for two different routes of administration: intravenous (IV) and oral. Ganaxolone is a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid. The different formulations are intended to maximize potential therapeutic applications of ganaxolone for adult and pediatric patient populations, in both acute and chronic care, and for both in-patient and self-administered settings. Ganaxolone acts at both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, a target known for its anti-seizure, antidepressant and anxiolytic potential.

COVID-19 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and has spread to nearly every country in the world, including the U.S. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified and many countries, including the U.S., have implemented severe travel restrictions, business shutdowns and social distancing measures that have impacted clinical development through supply chain shortages and clinical trial enrollment difficulties as hospitals reduce and redeploy staff, divert resources to patients suffering COVID-19 and limit hospital access for non-patients. The pandemic poses the risk that we, our contractors, suppliers, or other partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities for an indefinite period of time, including those due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.








The continued global spread of COVID-19 has affected our operations but did not have a material impact on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. For example, several of our Phase 1 trials of oral ganaxolone to support the CDD indication have continued enrollment and are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021, despite experiencing delays in enrollment due to COVID-19. Further, in response to COVID-19, for our ongoing clinical trials, we have implemented multiple measures consistent with guidance of the FDA on the conduct of clinical trials of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing remote site monitoring and remote visits using telemedicine where needed. However, COVID-19 may still adversely impact our clinical trials. For example, our RAISE Trial in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is being conducted in hospitals, and resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic may divert staffing in hospitals, taking resources away from our clinical trial. Our ganaxolone clinical trials in the outpatient setting may be negatively impacted if patients and their caregivers do not want to participate in a clinical trial while the COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely affect the world. Although operations were not materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have in the future on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. The duration and severity of the pandemic and its long-term impact on our business are uncertain at this time, and our ability to raise sufficient additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control, including the current volatility in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Pipeline
We are developing ganaxolone in indications where there is a mechanistic rationale for ganaxolone to provide a benefit, including the following indications:
​
​
Status Epilepticus (SE)
Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by continuous, prolonged seizures or rapidly recurring seizures without intervening recovery of consciousness. If SE is not treated urgently, permanent neuronal damage may occur, which contributes to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with SE who do not respond to first-line benzodiazepine treatment are classified as having established SE (ESE) and those who then progress to and then fail at least one second-line antiepileptic drug (AED) are classified as having RSE. In RSE, synaptic GABAA receptors are internalized into the neuron, resulting in decreased responsiveness to drugs such as benzodiazepines. Patients with RSE unresponsive to one or more second-line AEDs may be given an IV anesthetic to terminate seizures and prevent neuronal injury and other complications. SE that recurs following an attempted wean of IV anesthesia is classified as super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). We estimate the number of cases of SE in the United States and Europe to be approximately 156,000 per year, with approximately 50% progressing to ESE and approximately 50% of those patients further progressing to ESE. In April 2016, we were granted FDA orphan drug designation for IV formulation of ganaxolone for the treatment of SE.
In September 2019, we announced positive top-line results in our open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating IV ganaxolone in patients with RSE. The trial enrolled 17 medically heterogeneous patients who received an infusion of IV ganaxolone for up to 96 hours added to standard-of-care In addition to the target dose (713 mg/day), patients were enrolled into low dose (500 mg/day) and medium dose (650 mg/day) groups. Patients in the trial had failed a mean of 2.1 second-line IV AEDs (a mean of 2.9 total AED medications, including benzodiazepines) administered at therapeutic dose levels for an average of four hours prior to ganaxolone treatment.
In this clinical trial, ganaxolone met the primary endpoint with no patients (n=17) progressing to IV anesthetics within 24 hours of treatment initiation. The following table summarizes efficacy data through the four-week post treatment follow-up visit:

​Cohort | No escalation to IV anesthetics within 24 hrs from infusion initiation(Primary Endpoint) | Status-free through 24 hrs from infusion initiation* | No escalation to additional IV AEDs or IV anesthetics for status relapse at any time through 24 hrs after ganaxolone discontinuation | No SE relapse during the 4-wk follow up period
Target (713 mg/day)(n=8) | 100%(8 of 8) | 88%(7 of 8) | 100%(8 of 8) | 100%(6 of 6) 
Medium (650 mg/day) (n=4) | 100%(4 of 4) | 100%(4 of 4) | 75%(3 of 4) | 67%(2 of 3) 
Low (500 mg/day) (n=5) | 100%(5 of 5) | 100%(5 of 5) | 60%(3 of 5) | 50%(1 of 2) 

*Investigator determination 
​
In addition, the median time to status cessation across all dose cohorts was five minutes. Additional long-term data demonstrate that patients in the target dose cohort who were assessed at the end of a four-week follow up period (n=6) did not experience status relapse. An independent retrospective central review of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) data demonstrated that the target dose level provided sustained reductions in seizure burden (greater than 80%) throughout the entire analysis window.








In September 2020, we entered into a contract (BARDA Contract) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Under the BARDA Contract, we received an award of up to an estimated $51 million for development of RSE. The BARDA Contract provides funding to support, on a cost-sharing basis, the completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial of IV-administered ganaxolone in patients with RSE (our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating IV ganaxolone for the treatment of RSE (RAISE Trial)), funding of pre-clinical studies to provide support that IV-administered ganaxolone could be an effective treatment for RSE due to chemical nerve gas agent exposure, and funding of certain manufacturing scale-up and regulatory activities.







The BARDA Contract consists of a base period of approximately a two year duration during which BARDA will provide approximately $21 million of funding for the RAISE Trial on a cost share basis and funding of additional preclinical studies of ganaxolone in nerve agent exposure models. Following successful completion of the RAISE Trial and preclinical studies in the base period, the BARDA Contract provides for approximately $30 million of additional BARDA funding for three options in support of manufacturing, supply chain, clinical, regulatory and toxicology activities. Under the BARDA Contract, we will be responsible for cost sharing in the amount of approximately $33 million and BARDA will be responsible for approximately $51 million, if all development options are completed. The contract period-of-performance (base period plus option exercises) is up to approximately five years.






In January 2021, we enrolled the first patient in the RAISE Trial. The RAISE Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with RSE. Approximately 80 trial sites in hospitals across the U.S. will participate. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 124 patients, who will be randomized to receive ganaxolone or placebo added to standard of care. With this number of patients, the trial is designed to provide over 90 percent power to detect a 30 percent efficacy difference between ganaxolone and placebo. 
The co-primary endpoints for the RAISE Trial are (1) proportion of patients with RSE who experience seizure cessation within 30 minutes of treatment initiation without other medications for the treatment of RSE, and (2) proportion of patients with no progression to IV anesthesia for 36 hours following treatment initiation. We plan to announce top-line data from the trial in the first half of 2022. Planning continues for a separate RSE trial to be conducted in Europe. We are meeting with the EMA to discuss trial design in the first quarter of 2021 and a registration trial is planned to commence in the first half of 2022.

​
In addition to the RAISE Trial, we have also provided IV ganaxolone under Emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) applications for use in treating patients with SRSE and plans are also underway for a future SE clinical trial focusing on earlier intervention in ESE. The trial will be conducted in emergency rooms under exception from informed consent guidelines and will enroll patients with convulsive SE. We are making preparations to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial in ESE that is planned to begin in the first half of 2022. We expect that the trial will be composed of two stages, the initial open-label, dose optimization stage and subsequent double-blind placebo-controlled stage. We anticipate that during the open-label portion of the trial, multiple sequential cohorts of patients will be assessed to determine the bolus dose and subsequent IV infusion rate and infusion duration to be used in the double-blind second stage of the trial. We expect that this double-blind placebo-controlled phase will enroll approximately 80 ESE patients equally distributed among two arms of the trial who, in addition to standard of care, will receive either IV ganaxolone or placebo. We also expect that the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be the absence of electrographic (rapid EEG) evidence of SE or recurrence of generalized convulsions at 1 hour after the initiation of treatment. We plan to announce top-line data from the trial in the middle of 2023. 
​
CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD)
CDD is a serious and rare genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation of the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene, located on the X chromosome. It predominantly affects females and is characterized by early-onset, difficult-to-control seizures and severe neuro-developmental impairment. The CDKL5 gene encodes proteins essential for normal brain function. Most children affected by CDD cannot walk normally, talk, or care for themselves. Many also suffer from scoliosis, visual impairment, gastrointestinal difficulties or sleep disorders. There are no medications approved specifically for the treatment of CDD. Genetic testing is available to determine if a patient has a mutation in the CDKL5 gene. To our knowledge, no previous late-stage clinical trials have been conducted in this patient population and we estimate the CDD population to be approximately 12,500 patients in the United States and Europe. In June 2017, we were granted FDA orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDKL5 Disorder. Additionally, in November 2019, the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDKL5 Disorder.








In September 2020, we announced that ganaxolone achieved the primary endpoint in a Phase 3 clinical trial (Marigold Study) in children and young adults with CDD. The Marigold Study was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 101 patients between the ages of 2 and 21 with a confirmed disease-related CDKL5 gene variant. Patients underwent a six-week prospective baseline period to collect seizure data, followed by a 17-week double-blind treatment phase during which study treatment was added to existing AED therapy. Patients randomized to ganaxolone titrated over four weeks to a dose of up to 600 mg of oral liquid suspension three times a day and maintained that dose for the following 13 weeks. Following the double-blind treatment phase, all patients had the opportunity to receive ganaxolone in the open label phase of the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change in 28-day seizure frequency for major motor seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic and clonic seizures). Patients given ganaxolone showed a 32.2% median reduction in 28-day major motor seizure frequency, compared to a 4.0% reduction for those receiving the placebo, a statistically significant difference for the primary endpoint (p=0.002). Ganaxolone was generally well-tolerated, demonstrating a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials. The most frequent adverse event was somnolence.
We have received feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the efficacy and safety data resulting from the Marigold Study appear capable of supporting the filing of an NDA for ganaxolone in the treatment of CDD and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA is scheduled for March 2021 to gain FDA alignment on the proposed format and content of the NDA. Subject to the feedback from the FDA, we plan to submit an NDA for ganaxolone in the treatment of CDD to the FDA in mid-2021 and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at the end of the third quarter of 2021. 
 We continue to execute on our pre-commercial development plans for CDD, while simultaneously exploring commercialization opportunities for ganaxolone in CDD with third parties to maximize patient access. As such, we have launched an Expanded Access Program (EAP), which will allow patients who were not able to participate in the 

9



Marigold Study to begin receiving ganaxolone under a treatment protocol in advance of its potential commercial availability.
In July 2020, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) Designation for ganaxolone in the treatment of CDD. FDA grants RPD Designation for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. in which serious or life-threatening manifestations occur primarily in individuals 18 years of age and younger. If an NDA for ganaxolone in CDD is approved, we may be eligible to receive a priority review voucher from the FDA, which can be redeemed by us for priority review in a subsequent marketing application or potentially monetized by transferring such voucher to a third party. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 27, 2020, extended the priority review voucher program such that drugs designated for a rare pediatric disease by September 30, 2024 can receive a voucher if the drug is submitted and approved by September 30, 2026.
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
TSC is a rare genetic disorder that affects many organs and causes non-malignant tumors in the brain, skin, kidney, heart, eyes, and lungs. The condition is caused by inherited mutations in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. TSC occurs with a frequency of 1:6,000 live births and a mutation is found in 85% of patients. While the disease phenotype can be extremely variable, epilepsy occurs in up to 85% of TSC patients. TSC is a leading cause of genetic epilepsy, often manifesting in the first year of life as either focal seizures or infantile spasms. There are currently few disease-specific treatments approved for seizures in TSC. 
We are conducting a Phase 2 open-label trial (CALM Study) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adjunctive ganaxolone treatment in patients with TSC. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 25 patients ages 2 to 65 and consists of a four-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period and a 24-week extension. Patients will receive up to 600 mg of ganaxolone (oral liquid suspension) three times a day. The primary endpoint is the percent change in 28-day seizure frequency during the treatment period relative to baseline. We expect to report top-line data in the third quarter of 2021 and also plan to further explore whether allopregnanolone sulfate levels represent a response biomarker. The company’s interim evaluation of the dataset in the CALM Study supports our plan to move to a Phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2021. An End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA is targeted for the second quarter of 2021 and a meeting with the EMA is targeted for the third quarter of 2021 with the first patient enrolled in the fourth quarter of 2021.
PCDH19-Related Epilepsy (PCDH19-RE)
​
PCDH19-RE is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by early-onset seizures, cognitive and sensory impairment, and psychiatric and behavioral disturbances. Seizures occur in clusters lasting from several hours to days. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the PCDH19 gene on the X-chromosome. Unlike other X-linked disorders, it selectively affects females with very few cases reported in males. The gene encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion that is widely expressed in the central nervous system. There are no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of seizures associated with PCDH19-RE. 



We conducted a Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial (Violet Study) of ganaxolone treatment in patients with PCDH19-RE, in which enrollment is stratified based on allopregnanolone sulfate, a potential biomarker for the antiepileptic efficacy of ganaxolone.  We enrolled 21 patients in one of two strata based on baseline allopregnanolone sulfate levels. The trial consists of a 12-week prospective baseline period, followed by a 17-week double-blind treatment phase. Patients were titrated over four weeks to a dose of up to 600 mg of ganaxolone oral liquid suspension or matching placebo three times daily and maintain that dose for the following 13 weeks. Patients are expected to be offered the opportunity to remain on ganaxolone following the completion of the protocol-specified treatment. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in 28-day primary seizure frequency during the 17-week double-blind phase relative to the baseline. The primary seizure types were defined in the protocol as countable focal seizures that included progressive hypotonia and impaired awareness, or any countable focal or generalized seizure with a clear motor component. Focal and generalized nonmotor seizures and myoclonic seizures did not count as the primary 

10



seizure types for the primary efficacy endpoint. The analyses of the primary endpoint were performed on the sum of the individual countable seizures and each series of continuous uncountable seizures (each contributes one to the sum).
In March 2021, we announced top-line data from the Violet Study. In the trial, patients on ganaxolone experienced a median 61.5% reduction in primary-endpoint seizure frequency compared to a median 24.0% reduction in patients on placebo (p=0.17). Ganaxolone was generally well tolerated in the Violet Study, with one patient discontinuing on the ganaxolone arm due to a serious adverse event (SAE), psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, judged by the investigator to be ganaxolone-related. There was no allopregnanolone-sulphate biomarker signal. 
Orphan Designations
The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ganaxolone for the treatment of SE, CDD and PCDH19-RE. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development to novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States. The designation provides the drug developer with a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity, as well as tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical research trial design assistance and waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act filing fees.
Ganaxolone Mechanism of Action
Ganaxolone is a methylated analog of the endogenous neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone exhibits potent anxiolytic, antidepressant, antiepileptic and sedative activity. Unlike allopregnanolone, ganaxolone cannot be converted to active intermediates possessing steroid hormone activity.
Both ganaxolone and allopregnanolone bind to GABAA receptors that, when activated, permit flow of chloride ions into the neuron. This change in concentration of chloride ions results in hyperpolarization and is the basis for the inhibitory effect of GABA. Classic GABAA receptor-active drugs bind only at receptors located on the synapse between neurons. However, both allopregnanolone and ganaxolone also bind to extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Synaptic GABAA receptors respond quickly to inhibit neurotransmission (phasic inhibition), while extrasynaptic GABAA receptors provide a constant baseline level of inhibition (tonic inhibition).
Activity at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may be of particular importance for treating patients who have developed tolerance to benzodiazepines and barbiturates, such as occurs during RSE. 
Safety Overview
Oral Safety
More than 1,600 individuals have received oral formulations of ganaxolone for durations from one day to more than two years at doses of 50 to 2,000 mg/day. Ganaxolone was administered in Phase 2 clinical trials to pediatric patients at doses up to 1,800 mg/day and to adult patients at doses up to 1,875 mg/day. No drug-related deaths occurred in any of these clinical trials and the majority of adverse events (AEs) were non-serious and resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. The most common side effects with oral ganaxolone relate to sedation or somnolence. In the oral ganaxolone safety database there are no trends of medically important changes in blood chemistry, vital signs, liver function, renal function or cardiovascular parameters in the adult or pediatric populations.

In the Marigold Study, ganaxolone was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials. The most frequent AE was somnolence. 
IV Safety
In 2016, we completed a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial with IV ganaxolone that enrolled 36 patients, designed to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of IV ganaxolone administered as an 

11



ascending bolus dose (Stage 1) or continuous infusion (Stage 2).  Four subject cohorts were enrolled in Stage 1 and one cohort was enrolled in Stage 2. 
Every dose regimen of IV ganaxolone, either bolus or continuous infusion, was generally safe and well-tolerated and rapidly reached targeted dose levels.  Six treatment-emergent AEs were reported, all of which were mild in severity and resolved without intervention. Only headache was considered possibly related to study treatment. No patient discontinued due to an AE and no SAEs were reported. IV ganaxolone plasma concentrations were generally proportional to the administered dose. In addition, the continuous infusion of IV ganaxolone achieved the targeted exposure levels associated with anticonvulsant activity.
In 2019, we announced positive top-line results in our open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating IV ganaxolone in patients with RSE. In the trial, ganaxolone had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for the RSE patient population in all dose groups. There were 10 SAEs; eight were considered not related to treatment and two were considered treatment-related (TRSAEs). The TRSAEs were severe sedation in two patients that led to early ganaxolone discontinuation: one in the medium dose group on day three and one in the target dose group on day one. There were 50 AEs, thirteen of which were TRAEs reported in seven patients.  The most commonly reported TRAEs were somnolence, mild hypotension and sedation.
Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
We have completed preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology testing, including reproductive toxicology. Animal pharmacokinetic and in vitro studies show that ganaxolone is metabolized primarily by the Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) family of liver enzymes, a common route of drug metabolism. All in vitro studies have shown that ganaxolone has low potential for interaction with other drugs at several multiples of observed human ganaxolone levels. Furthermore, neither ganaxolone nor its metabolites have a ketone ring at the 3-position, a requirement for hormonal activity. In binding studies, ganaxolone has no appreciable affinity for estrogen or progesterone receptors. We found no evidence of changes in blood, liver, kidney or the gastrointestinal systems indicating functional or anatomical adverse effects associated with either single- or multiple-dose treatment with ganaxolone in preclinical safety pharmacology studies, nor have we seen evidence of any end organ toxicity from human clinical trials. We have not detected potential for ganaxolone to cause cellular mutations or carcinogenicity in trials to date.
Ganaxolone is metabolized extensively in animals and humans.  During the development of CDD, one major metabolite (M2) was present in plasma of humans that was not found in plasma of rats or dogs.  We are working to establish the chemical structure of M2. In October, the FDA communicated that the characterization of the activity of the M2 metabolite would need to be included in the NDA submission. Results from any additional studies that may be required based on an evaluation of these or additional data sets could be submitted during the review or, if unavailable, in response to a post-marketing requirement(s) if the application is approved. We have recently completed an activity assay for the M2 metabolite and believe the results are consistent with our expectations and supportive of a mid-year 2021 filing.
In reproductive toxicology studies, ganaxolone did not cause malformations of the embryo or fetus in rats or mice and did not significantly affect the development of offspring. No changes in sperm parameters were found. We believe these findings are important, as many currently marketed AEDs have shown developmental toxicities in animal studies, including fetal death and skeletal abnormalities. Valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, topiramate and other AEDs have been linked to birth defects in humans (e.g., head and facial malformations and lowered birth weight). These findings have resulted in labeling for these drugs indicating evidence of human fetal risk.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to maximize the value of ganaxolone as a best-in-class therapy for rare seizure and neurological disorders through development of multiple formulations for oral and IV administration. The key elements of our strategy include the following:

12




• | Pursuing hospital-based rare and underserved indications for ganaxolone. We believe that hospitalized SE patients who do not respond to available first- and second-line treatment options are significantly underserved with severely limited treatment options and are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Due to its activity at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, ganaxolone may provide a therapeutic benefit as second-line therapy for patients whose SE is refractory to treatment with benzodiazapines. To that end, and based on our recent Phase 2 trial results, we are conducting the RAISE Trial in RSE patients and may in the future study similar and other hospital-based patient populations that could benefit from ganaxolone’s mechanism of action. If our clinical trials are successful, we may in-license complementary assets to leverage our development and commercial investments. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing orphan, genetic epilepsy indications for ganaxolone. Within epilepsy, there are several disorders where the symptoms have been linked to deficits in GABAergic signaling. Based on our clinical data, we believe that increasing GABAergic tone with ganaxolone could provide benefits and that treatments for these small populations have the potential for more efficient paths through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization. In addition to CDD, PCDH19-RE, and TSC, we may in the future develop ganaxolone in one or more additional indications for rare epilepsies. We may also seek to in-license complementary products to leverage development and commercial investment if we elect to commercialize ganaxolone for these indications, if approved. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing targeted depression and other neuropsychiatric disorder indications for ganaxolone. Due to its mechanism of action, we believe ganaxolone has potential for therapeutic benefit in a variety of targeted neuropsychiatric disorders. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials demonstrate that treatment with ganaxolone could benefit patients with depression, anxiety, mood, sleep and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We may also explore development of ganaxolone in other targeted depression-related, neuropsychiatric conditions. We have currently deferred further development of ganaxolone for the treatment of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of ganaxolone for SE and orphan refractory epilepsy indications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Building on our product pipeline. We intend to expand and diversify our product pipeline through further development of ganaxolone in additional indications and/or acquisition of additional drug candidates that fit our business strategy. In addition, we may expand the targeted indication footprint and explore new potential formulations for our ganaxolone franchise.

One of the patent families includes pending applications filed in Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States that claim certain methods of treating epileptic disorders. The 20-year term for patents in this family runs through 2038, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. A second patent family currently includes one pending international patent application filed under the PCT that claims certain methods of treating TSC. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on this PCT application before applicable deadlines. The 20-year term for patents based on this family run through 2040, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We also own two patent families directed to certain methods of treating depressive disorders. One patent family consists of two granted United States patents and one allowed US patent directed to certain methods of using ganaxolone for treating postpartum depression and related disorders. The 20-year patent term of this family runs through 2037, absent any available patent term adjustments. A second patent family currently includes one pending international patent application filed under the PCT that claims certain methods of using ganaxolone for treating postpartum depression using ganaxolone. The 20-year term of this family runs through 2039, absent any available patent term extensions. Our fifth patent family currently comprises one pending United States provisional application directed to certain new therapeutic regimens for treating epileptic disorders. We intend to file an international patent application under the PCT before the applicable deadline.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and some of our collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
General Considerations
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our ganaxolone synthesis and formulations will depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our commercial success will depend in part upon not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent could require us to alter 

14



our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.


The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions, where available, on patents covering those products in the respective jurisdictions.
Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Even if a particular third-party patent is identified as possibly being relevant to our product candidates or technology, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe upon the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, we may be subject to patent litigation. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome can be favorable or unfavorable.
Licenses and Collaborations
CyDex
In March 2017, we entered into a License Agreement and a Supply Agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CyDex).  Under the terms of the License Agreement, CyDex has granted us an exclusive license to use CyDex’s sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin, or Captisol®,drug formulation system and related intellectual property in connection with the development and commercialization of ganaxolone in any and all therapeutic uses in humans, with some exceptions. 
As consideration for this license, we paid an upfront fee and are required to make additional payments in the future upon achievement of various specified clinical and regulatory milestones.  We will also be required to pay royalties to CyDex on sales of ganaxolone, if successfully developed, in the low-to-mid single digits based on levels of annual net sales. As of December 31, 2020, we had not met any additional milestones under the License Agreement and had not made any additional payments to CyDex other than the upfront fee; however we achieved a milestone in the first quarter of 2021 with a payment now due. Certain patents relating to Captisol®, including some that were licensed to us by CyDex, have expired, while other patents that are licensed to us remain in force.
Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, we are required to purchase all of our requirements for Captisol with respect to ganaxolone from CyDex, and CyDex is required to supply us with Captisol for such purposes, subject to certain limitations.
NovaMedica
In December 2012, we entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement (Transfer Agreement) with DRI. Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, in exchange for a payment of $100,000, we assigned to DRI certain patents and patents applications in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan (the Covered Territory), and granted to DRI an exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable and assignable license under our know-how to develop and commercialize ganaxolone and other products that would infringe our patent rights or use our know-how (the Covered Products) in the Covered Territory, in the field 

15



of uses for any human or animal disease or condition excluding the treatment of unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage (the Field). DRI subsequently transferred all of its rights and obligations under the Transfer Agreement to NovaMedica. Under the terms of the Transfer Agreement, NovaMedica, or its permitted transferees or assignees, has the exclusive right within the Covered Territory to manufacture the Covered Products solely for development and commercialization in the Covered Territory in the Field. Until the first commercial sale of a Covered Product within the Covered Territory, NovaMedica will have the right to purchase supplies of the Covered Product from us on a cost-plus basis, subject to certain limitations. The Transfer Agreement also provides that we will enter into the Supply Agreement with NovaMedica to supply ganaxolone and/or Covered Product for development in the Covered Territory at a future date.
In June 2013, we entered into a Clinical Development and Collaboration Agreement (the Collaboration Agreement) with NovaMedica, pursuant to which we agreed to assist NovaMedica in the development and commercialization of Covered Products in the Covered Territory in the Field. The Collaboration Agreement requires the formation of committees consisting of our representatives and NovaMedica representatives to oversee the general development, day-to-day development work and commercialization of Covered Products in the Field in the Covered Territory. NovaMedica is required to reimburse us for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by us in providing this assistance, except for expenses incurred in our participation on the joint committees. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement and the Transfer Agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to include sites in the Russian Federation in our clinical trial programs for the first indications of the Covered Products at our sole expense. Under the Transfer Agreement, at least 36 months prior to the first commercial sale of a product candidate in the Covered Territory, the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith a supply agreement pursuant to which we or a third party contract manufacturer authorized by us to manufacture and supply the Covered Products, will supply needed quantities of Covered Product to NovaMedica solely for commercialization of Covered Products in the Covered Territory, on commercially fair and reasonable terms. Such purchases will be made on a cost-plus basis. The Collaboration Agreement expires on the earlier of three years following the first commercial sale of a product candidate in the Covered Territory or the termination of the Transfer Agreement. NovaMedica also has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time at its convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice.
Purdue Neuroscience Company (Purdue)
In September 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Purdue, which was amended and restated in May 2008, that granted us exclusive rights to certain know-how and technology relating to ganaxolone, excluding the field of treatment of unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense, subject to prior written approval by Purdue, and we have sublicensed our licensed rights to NovaMedica for the Covered Territory. We are obligated to pay royalties as a percentage in the range of high single digits up to 10% of net product sales for direct licensed products, such as ganaxolone. The obligation to pay royalties expires, on a country-by-country basis, ten years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product in each country. Upon commercialization, we estimate the in-licensed technology would result in us paying royalties to Purdue in the low single digits as a percentage of sales. Other payment obligations may be triggered if we successfully partner our product candidates with third parties. In addition, the agreement also requires that we pay Purdue a percentage in the mid-single digits of the non-royalty consideration that we receive from a sublicensee and a percentage in the twenties of milestone payments received from sublicensees for indications other than seizure disorders and vascular migraine headaches not associated with mood disorders. Under the license agreement, we are committed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specifically from companies that treat rare seizure disorders.
There are a variety of available therapies marketed for rare seizure disorders. In many cases, these products are administered in combination to enhance efficacy or to reduce side effects. Some of these drugs are branded and subject 

16



to patent protection, some are in clinical development and not yet approved, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products. More established companies have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows, established commercial infrastructure and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources.
Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render ganaxolone obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of ganaxolone’s development and commercialization.
We primarily compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are developing therapies or marketing drugs to treat indications that we are targeting.
SE
SE patients generally are treated with benzodiazepines as first-line treatment. When benzodiazepines are not effective the patients are in established SE (ESE) and are treated with various second-line IV AEDs, such as levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, lacosamide, or valproate. In 2019, a multicenter, randomized clinical trial (Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial; ESETT) was conducted by a group of academic investigators and was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line IV AEDs in ESE. In this trial, the efficacy of levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, or valproate was evaluated in convulsive ESE patients. It was reported that levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate were effective at stopping SE in 47%, 45%, and 46% of the patients, respectively. When second-line AEDs are not effective, RSE patients are generally placed in a medically-induced coma under IV anesthesia in an attempt to stop the seizures and prevent further damage to the brain and death. Patients on third-line IV anesthesia are at higher risk for anesthesia-associated morbidities, such as infection, and have 2.9 times greater mortality rate. In addition, patients on IV anesthetics for SE treatment have increased lengths of stays in the hospital and ICU resulting in increased healthcare utilization. To our knowledge, there are no treatments indicated for RSE, and there are no other companies currently conducting clinical trials in SE patients.
CDD, TSC and PCDH19-RE
There are no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of CDD or PCDH19-RE, and two drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.’s Afinitor DISPERZ® (everolimus tablets for oral suspension) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol). CDD, PCDH19-RE and TSC patients are typically prescribed drugs approved for epileptic seizures, which often fail to control seizures in these patient populations. To our knowledge, there is only one other company with a drug in active development for the treatment of CDD (Ovid Therapeutics, Inc.’s OV935), no other ongoing clinical trials in PCDH19-RE, and no other ongoing clinical trials in TSC.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing of drugs and product candidates, including ganaxolone, must comply with FDA current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. Ganaxolone is a synthetic small molecule made through a series of organic chemistry steps starting with commercially available organic chemical raw materials. We conduct manufacturing activities under individual purchase orders with independent contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to supply our clinical trials. We have an internal quality program and have qualified and signed quality agreements with our major CMOs. We conduct periodic quality audits of their facilities. We believe that our existing suppliers of ganaxolone’s active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished product will be capable of providing sufficient quantities of each to meet our clinical trial supply needs. Other CMOs may be used in the future for clinical supplies and, subject to approval, commercial manufacturing.

17



Ganaxolone Formulations
The therapeutic possibilities of ganaxolone have been understood for some time; however, because ganaxolone is a high-dose water insoluble compound, developing a formulation that could provide consistent drug exposure and could be manufactured at a commercially feasible cost had proven challenging. We believe our patented nanoparticulate formulation and novel manufacturing process for ganaxolone can successfully address the cost of manufacturing and pharmacokinetic challenges that previously encumbered the clinical and commercial feasibility of ganaxolone. 
Ganaxolone is currently formulated for oral and IV administration. In addition, we are evaluating various formulation approaches to improve ganaxolone’s oral drug properties.
Commercial Operations
If we obtain FDA approval for ganaxolone, we intend to build sales and marketing infrastructures to reach high prescribing neurologist, critical care, epilepsy specialists and other target physician populations in the United States. We believe a focused sales and marketing organization could be leveraged to market ganaxolone across multiple epilepsy, neurology or psychiatry indications if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for those other indications. We may seek co-promotion partners for our sales efforts to reach other United States physician groups, such as primary care physicians. We believe that there could also be significant market opportunities for ganaxolone in epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric conditions outside of the United States. In order to capitalize on such opportunities, we plan to seek collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that have greater reach and resources by virtue of their size and experience in the field.
Government Regulation
As a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDC Act) and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our product candidates in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. In addition, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union (EU) are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but country-specific regulation also remains in many essential respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations will require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources in order to be successful.
United States Government Regulation
The FDA is the main agency that regulates pharmaceuticals in the United States, and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply with applicable requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board (IRB) of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations, as applicable, including pharmacology and formulation studies to develop detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18




● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) to support human clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations, including requirements for good clinical practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each targeted indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Clinical Trials
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. A 30-day waiting period after the initial submission of an IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not raised concerns or questions about the proposed clinical testing and placed the IND on clinical hold within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may initiate. If an IND has been placed on clinical hold, the sponsor must resolve the FDA’s outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which are requirements meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to assure the quality, reliability and integrity of data collected in clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail, among other things, the subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, the dosing regimen, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on United States subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The informed written consent of each participating subject is required, and an IRB at each site where the trial is conducted must approve the trial. The IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the registration of ongoing clinical trials and the reporting of clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of an investigational product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:

● | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational product candidate into humans. Phase 1 trials generally are conducted in healthy volunteers but in some cases are conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetic properties (PKs) and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 trials, sufficient information about the investigational product candidate’s 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




PKs and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted in patients with the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate, and to obtain initial evidence of the effectiveness of the investigational product candidate for a particular indication. Phase 2 trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited subject population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Phase 3 trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Phase 3 trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the drug; however, the FDA may find a single Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence to be sufficient in rare instances, particularly in an area of significant unmet medical need and if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period of time, if at all. The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority, such as the FDA, or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial, which is referred to as a clinical hold, at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee or data safety monitoring board. Such a group provides recommendations to the sponsor for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points, based on limited access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain clinical trial results and other trial information after completion.
A sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment (SPA) the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design and size of certain clinical trials or animal studies that will adequately address scientific and/or regulatory requirements that could support marketing approval. A sponsor may make a specific request for an SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the regulatory record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a trial will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the trial is subject to an SPA.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA to request market approval for the product in specified indications.

20



New Drug Applications
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA.
In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of FDA’s acceptance for filing. An accelerated six-month review can be given to applications that meet certain criteria. The FDA can extend the review period by three months, or potentially longer, to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information provided in the initial submission. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. FDA Advisory Committee meetings are often held for New Chemical Entities (NCEs), novel indications, or for applications that otherwise present scientific, technical, or policy questions on which the agency believes it would benefit from the perspectives of outside experts. An advisory committee meeting includes a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and prior FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical 

21



data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Compounds that have a potential for patient dependence and abuse are classified as controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and similar state and foreign laws. In the United States, for new chemical entities under development for therapeutic use, FDA makes recommendations about whether a drug should be scheduled as a controlled substance, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) makes the final determination. In the case of a new drug approved by the FDA, the final DEA scheduling determination generally occurs several months, and in some cases longer, after FDA approval of the NDA. Drugs that are scheduled as controlled substances are subject to stringent regulatory requirements, including requirements for registering manufacturing and distribution facilities, security controls and employee screening, recordkeeping, reporting, product labeling and packaging, import and export. There are five federal schedules for controlled substances, known as Schedule I, II, III, IV and V. The regulatory requirements that apply to a drug vary depending on the particular controlled substance schedule into which a drug is placed, based on consideration of its potential for dependence and abuse and its medicinal uses. Schedules I and II contain the most stringent restrictions and requirements, and Schedule V the least. For all controlled substances, there are potential criminal and civil penalties that apply for the failure to meet applicable legal requirements, and healthcare professionals must have special DEA licenses in order to prescribe controlled substances.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
In the United States, FDA may grant breakthrough therapy designation to a drug candidate if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may offer substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over existing options for patients with a serious condition. Features of breakthrough therapy designation include intensive guidance to ensure that the design of clinical trials are as efficient as practicable, increased involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff and where appropriate, a cross-disciplinary project lead assigned to the FDA review team, and rolling review of the NDA. Breakthrough designation can be requested with the IND or ideally no later than the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. 
Fast Track Designation 
Fast Track is a designation by the FDA of an investigational drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and for which nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. The request for fast track designation can be initiated with the IND or ideally no later than the pre-NDA/BLA meeting. Features of fast track designation include more frequent meetings and interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, including to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval, and a rolling review of the NDA/BLA. 
Priority Review
Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trials submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from FDA acceptance for filing. Priority review may be granted where a product is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of the serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from FDA acceptance for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
In July 2020, the FDA granted RPD Designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The FDA grants RPD Designation for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. in which serious or life-threatening manifestations occur primarily in individuals 18 years of age and younger. If an NDA for ganaxolone in CDD is approved, we may be eligible to receive a priority review voucher from the FDA, which can be redeemed for priority review in a subsequent marketing application.

22



Post-Approval Regulation
After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, a sponsor is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a sponsor is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information, submit annual reports and comply with advertising and promotional labeling requirements. 
Manufacturing must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose manufacturing documentation requirements. Accordingly, sponsors must continue to expend time, money and effort to maintain quality control and compliance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of ganaxolone. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling—because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. In general, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS OIG), as well as state authorities. Enforcement action could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings, contraindications, or limitations of use, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDC Act
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be referenced by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients, 

23



generally in the same strengths and dosage form, as a referenced listed drug (RLD) and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the RLD. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the reference drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data, but at least some of this information comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and to which the applicant does not have a right of reference. Drugs approved through an ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD, depending on applicable state laws. 
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use or use covered by regulatory exclusivity. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired.
Marketing Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before five-year marketing exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. In this case, the 30-month stay, if applicable, runs from the end of the five-year marketing exclusivity period. 

In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of twenty-seven Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related Marketing Authorization (MA) has been granted. MA for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These procedures include a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (if marketing authorization is sought for a single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all twenty-seven EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein and Norway) all of whom are part of the EEA.

The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized 

24



in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients at EU level within the EU.



In the EU, a medicinal product containing a new active substance, which has never been approved in a medicinal product in the EU before, as well as in certain other circumstances, is entitled to eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of market exclusivity following a grant of MA. During the first eight years, no generic company may refer to the data used by the innovator to obtain a marketing authorization. After eight years, generics may reference the innovator data, but generic medicinal products may only be placed on the market after a total of ten years. Approval of a new indication will not result in a separate additional period of regulatory data protection and market exclusivity. If, however, during the first eight years after initial marketing authorization, a new indication is approved which is considered by the competent authorities to be of significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies, this would result in one additional year of market exclusivity, in addition to the initial eight plus two years. Such significant clinical benefit would generally have to be supported by comparative clinical trials.

Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products assesses applications for orphan designations after which the European Commission may grant orphan drug designation. In the EU, orphan designation is granted if it is established that a medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. In addition, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life- threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. In order to obtain orphan designation in the EU, it must in addition be established that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in the EU or if such method exists, that the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
In the United States, orphan drug designation may confer eligibility for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application for the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.



In the EU, orphan drug designation may be granted to drugs that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives. Orphan drug designation also entitles an applicant for MA to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and protocol assistance, a type of scientific advice specific for designated orphan medicinal products. Following a grant of MA, the product is entitled to ten years of exclusivity if the product continues to be designated as an orphan medical product upon grant of the marketing authorization. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the orphan exclusivity period, the competent authorities in the EU may not accept a marketing authorization application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (i.e., a medicinal product with an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features and which acts via the same mechanism) with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.

25



In the EU, if pediatric studies are conducted in accordance with a pediatric investigation plan, which was previously agreed upon with the European Medicines Agency, it may be possible to obtain an extension of orphan market exclusivity of two years, resulting in a total orphan market exclusivity period of twelve years.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not change the scientific/medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between an effective IND and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
Many other countries also provide for patent term extensions or similar extensions of patent protection for pharmaceutical products. For example, in Japan, it may be possible to extend the patent term for up to five years and in the EU, it may be possible to obtain a supplementary protection certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years.
In the EU, if pediatric studies are conducted in accordance with a pediatric investigation plan, which was previously agreed upon with the EMA, it may be possible to obtain an extension of a supplementary protection certificate of up to six months. This pediatric extension would not be available if the product is an orphan medicinal product. The extension would also not be available if one additional year of market exclusivity was granted for a new pediatric indication on the basis of the results of pediatric studies conducted in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
European and Other International Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a request for a clinical trial authorization (CTA) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a request for a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The conduct of a clinical trial in the EU must comply with regulatory requirements based on the Clinical Trial Directive, the details of which may vary per EU Member State. In addition, when conducting a clinical trial in the EU, the processing of personal data, including pseudonymized data, would have to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR imposes strict obligations on the processing of personal data, including relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries such as the US. 

26



The competent authorities of the EU Member States may impose significant financial penalties in the event of violation of the GDPR.
To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). MAAs can be submitted to the EMA through a centralized procedure, resulting in one marketing authorization valid throughout the EU (27 EU Member States as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain products, such as orphan medicinal products or product with a new active substance for certain therapeutic indications and is optional for certain other products, such as products that contain a new active substance that has not previously been approved in a medicinal product in the EU. Alternative MAA routes in the EU are the decentralized procedure in which it is possible to request marketing authorization in a selection of various EU Member States, the national procedure in which a marketing authorization is requested for one EU Member State only or the mutual recognition procedure in which marketing authorization in one or more EU Member States is requested on the basis of a prior marketing authorization in another EU Member State.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Russia, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Small Medium Enterprise (SME) designation 
In the EU, small medium enterprise designation (SME) can be granted to non-subsidiary, independent firms which employ fewer than 250 employees to promote innovation and the development of new medicinal products by smaller companies. The criteria for designation is dependent on staff headcount, either turnover or balance sheet total and the ownership structure, including any partnership or linkage.  Benefits of SME designation include direct assistance on regulatory aspects of the pharmaceutical legislation, help navigating the array of services available, fee exemptions and reductions for pre- and post-authorization regulatory procedures, assistance with translations of product information into all official EU languages, guidance on clinical data publication and a free redaction tool license, liaison with academic investigators in pediatric-medicine research through the European Network of Pediatric Research at the EMA and workshops and training sessions. In 2020, we renewed our SME designation in the EU.
Compliance
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Accelerated Review (EU)
Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which should be justified on a case-by-case basis. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.

Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Affordable Care Act), has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act has impacted pre-existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs. For example, the Affordable Care Act provides for Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to Medicare physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any covered entity engaged in manufacturing or importing certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among such entities in accordance with their respective market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price (AMP), for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act (FCA) and the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients (Medicare Part D), coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70.0% (as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered outpatient drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the types of entities eligible for participation in and discounts under the Public Health Service 340B drug pricing program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new requirements to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any “payments or transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection to be required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to be required by March 31, 2014, and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28




● | a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents, beginning in 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation and implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unclear how the Affordable Care Act and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify or invalidate, the Affordable Care Act, or portions thereof, will affect our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of, on average, 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and continuing through 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further state and federal healthcare reform measures adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that state and federal governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Ganaxolone may not be considered by payers to be medically necessary or cost-effective for particular diseases or conditions. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

29



In addition, Medicare Part D and further legislation may limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing. While government payment pursuant to Medicare Part D for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for ganaxolone from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration (anything of value), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return either for the referral of an individual for, or for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from AKS liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. The regulatory safe harbors also are subject to regulatory revision and interpretation by a number of government agencies. For example, in November 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services finalized a previously abandoned proposal to amend the discount safe harbor regulation of the AKS in a purported effort to create incentives to manufacturers to lower their list prices, and to lower federal program beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. The rule, which is currently slated to take full effect January 1, 2023, revises the AKS discount safe harbor to exclude manufacturer rebates to Medicare Part D plans, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), creates a new safe harbor for point-of-sale price reductions that are set in advance and are available to the beneficiary at the point-of-sale, and creates a new safe harbor for service fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs for services rendered to the manufacturer. It is too early to know whether the U.S. administration 

30



under President Biden will further delay, rewrite, or allow the rule to go into effect, and if so, what the effect of the rule will be on negotiations of coverage for our products with Medicare Part D plans, or whether the rule will affect our coverage arrangements with commercial insurers. It is also unclear whether the rule will have the intended effect of reducing net prices and beneficiary out-of-pocket costs without also increasing Medicare Part D premiums, which may impact the willingness of Part D plans to cover our products and the price concessions or other terms the plans or their PBMs may seek from us. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, damages, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.




The federal civil False Claims Act (FCA) prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Such private individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
Also, many states have analogous fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Other state laws require posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. Some states restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Other states require identification or licensing of sales representatives.

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. We may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, numerous other federal and state laws and regulations govern privacy and security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space.
In California, the CCPA took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency and creates new data privacy rights for consumers. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may impose limitations on our activities or otherwise adversely affect our business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the EU, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and research activities. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions may lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
The EU, EEA countries and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. The GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018 and is directly applicable in each EEA country. The Regulation will result in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EEA. The GDPR imposes strict requirements and onerous accountability obligations on companies that process personal data, especially if they process sensitive personal data (such as data concerning patient health), including significant fines for non-compliance with the GDPR. Implementation of the GDPR has influenced other jurisdictions to either amend, or propose legislation to amend their existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws to resemble the requirements of GDPR.




In addition to the foregoing requirements, we expect to participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, if we successfully commercialize one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data, such as average manufacturer price and best price, that we would have to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid Drug Rebate Programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final regulation that modified existing Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value-based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); provide definitions for “line 

32



extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions (beginning in 2022); and revise manufacturer price and best price exclusions of manufacturer-sponsored patient benefit programs, specifically regarding inapplicability of such exclusions in the context of pharmacy benefit manager “accumulator” programs (beginning in 2023). Our failure to comply with the aforementioned price reporting and rebate payment obligations if we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program could negatively impact our financial results. 
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation or regulation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations if we successfully commercialize one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.

HRSA issued a final regulation, effective January 1, 2019, regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement, pursuant to which manufacturers must report the 340B ceiling prices for their covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis. HRSA then publishes those prices to 340B covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution (ADR) process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.

Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. In a November 20, 2020 interim final rule, CMS established a “Most Favored Nation” demonstration model that would lower Medicare Part B reimbursement of certain drugs based on international reference prices. The rule has become subject to judicial challenges, and federal courts have enjoined the rule at this time. There is also proposed legislation pending that would establish an international reference price-based payment methodology.
In order to be eligible to have our products that we successfully commercialize paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also would have to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), pricing program. As part of this program, we would be obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory 

33



Federal Ceiling Price (FCP) to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard).
The FCP is based on the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP), which we would be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS pricing and contracting obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. For additional information regarding obligations under federal health care programs, refer to the risk factor entitled “If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that program or other governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the United States our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (for example, the OIG), the DOJ and individual United States Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

Human Capital
We are committed to a work environment that is welcoming, inclusive and encouraging. To achieve our plans and goals, it is imperative that we attract and retain top talent. In order to do so, we aim to have a safe and encouraging workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop professionally, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and other incentives. In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer every full-time employee a cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefits package and equity compensation.

Historically, we have experienced a low turnover of employees. During 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 5%. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 65 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees. In addition to our employees, we contract with third-parties for the conduct of certain clinical development, manufacturing, accounting and 

34



administrative activities. We anticipate increasing the number of our employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees have been working remotely. We implemented a number of significant safety measures based on current guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for employees who choose to work at the Company’s facilities. These include, but are not limited to, social distancing, capacity limitations, mask requirements in common areas, weekly deep cleaning and daily sanitation procedures. 
Reverse stock split
​
On September 23, 2020, we effected a 1-for-4 reverse split of shares of our common stock (Reverse Split), as approved by our board of directors and stockholders. The par value per share of our common stock was not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Split, and our authorized shares of common stock was reduced to 150,000,000. All of the share and per share amounts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split.
