Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on developing products to treat and transform the lives of patients suffering from venous diseases. Our initial product offering consists of two minimally-invasive, novel catheter-based mechanical thrombectomy devices. We purpose-built our products for the specific characteristics of the venous system and the treatment of the two distinct manifestations of venous thromboembolism, or VTE – deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Our ClotTriever product is FDA-cleared for the removal of clot from peripheral blood vessels and is used to treat patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. Our FlowTriever product is the first thrombectomy system FDA-cleared for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, or PE. These products have been used to treat more than 20,000 patients at over 800 hospitals across the United States. We have experienced significant growth since we began commercializing our products, with approximately 13,200 procedures performed using our products in 2020. 
 VTE is a disease caused by blood clot formation in the veins of the body and is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. VTE represents the third most common vascular diagnosis in the United States after myocardial infarction and stroke. Researchers estimate that approximately one million people present with VTE in the United States each year, with approximately 668,000 new patients diagnosed with DVT and approximately 400,000 new patients diagnosed with PE each year. VTE results in approximately 296,000 deaths in the United States each year and industry sources estimate that VTE-related direct health care costs exceed $10 billion per year. 
 Of the estimated 668,000 new DVT diagnoses and 400,000 new PE diagnoses in the United States each year, we believe approximately 242,000 DVT patients and approximately 200,000 PE patients could benefit from safe and effective treatment with our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products, respectively. In addition, among the 668,000 DVT patients, we believe there are approximately 20,000 patients with clot in transit in the right atrium who could benefit from treatment with FlowTriever products.  Taken together, this represents a potential annual addressable U.S. market opportunity for our current products of approximately $3.8 billion. We also believe there is a substantial market opportunity outside the United States. 
 The current standard of care for treating VTE is conservative medical management with anticoagulants, which are drugs designed to prevent further blood clotting but that do not break down or eliminate existing clots. Anticoagulants are intended to stop further clot formation while the body attempts to break down and remove clots using natural mechanisms. Nearly all patients receive this treatment, many of whom remain on anticoagulants for the remainder of their lives. We estimate that 68% of our target DVT patients and 90% of our target PE patients are treated with anticoagulants alone. We estimate that the remaining 32% of our target DVT patients and 10% of our target PE patients also receive additional treatment using mechanical thrombectomy or thrombolytic drug therapy. 
 Historically, development efforts for mechanical thrombectomy devices have focused on arterial devices, which are then repurposed for use in the venous system. Given the significant differences between the arterial and venous systems and the clot that forms in each system, these devices have difficulty removing venous clot, which is often adhered to the vessel wall and is older, firmer and substantially larger than arterial clot. 
 Thrombolytic drugs accelerate the body’s natural mechanisms for breaking down clot but are generally not effective on venous clot. These drugs also are associated with a risk of spontaneous major bleeding, including catastrophic bleeding in the brain. In addition, these drugs are expensive and require monitoring in a critical care setting, such as the intensive care unit, or ICU. 
 We believe the best way to treat VTE and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from this disease is to safely and effectively remove the blood clot. With that in mind, we designed and purpose-built our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products. The ClotTriever is a mechanical thrombectomy system designed to core, capture and remove large clots from large vessels and is used to treat DVT. The FlowTriever is a large bore catheter-based aspiration and mechanical thrombectomy system designed to remove large clots from large vessels to treat PE. Both products are designed to eliminate the need for thrombolytic drugs.

We believe our products are transformational because they offer hospitals, physicians and patients the following key benefits: 
  
• | Capture and remove large clot burden from large vessels;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Liberate clot mechanically and remove venous clot from the vessel wall;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eliminate the need for thrombolytic drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Remove clot safely with minimal blood loss;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Offer simple, intuitive and easy to use solutions to physicians;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable short, single-session treatment with improved hospital and physician efficiency; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Require no capital investment.
--+-------------------------------

 We believe the historical bias for conservative medical management is largely due to the ineffectiveness of, and risks associated with, current alternative treatments, and the lack of mechanical tools capable of removing venous clot in a safe, effective and simple way. The standard of care for treatment of other thrombotic diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, has evolved from the use of anticoagulants alone to anticoagulants together with thrombolytic drugs and eventually to anticoagulants together with definitive catheter-based interventions. We believe our products could be the catalyst to drive the same evolution of treatment for venous diseases, establishing our products as the standard of care for DVT and PE. 
 Our ClotTriever and FlowTriever have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The primary clinical study we have completed to date regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products is our FlowTriever Pulmonary Embolectomy Clinical Study, or FLARE study, which was completed in October 2017. The FLARE study supported FDA 510(k) clearance of the FlowTriever for the treatment of PE, which was received in May 2018. We are committed to continuing to develop a strong base of clinical evidence and real-world patient outcomes to further support the safety and effectiveness of our products. We are currently enrolling two 500-patient registries: ClotTriever Outcomes, or CLOUT, for DVT and FlowTriever All-Comer Registry for Patient Safety and Hemodynamics, or FLASH, for PE. In addition, we are initiating the FlowTriever for Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism, or FLAME, registry for high-risk PE in 2021 and there are multiple ongoing investigator-initiated studies. We believe these efforts will generate a robust cadence of publications, drive adoption of our products, increase awareness of venous diseases and inform the design of future definitive clinical trials. 
 We believe our venous-focused commercial organization provides a significant competitive advantage. Our most important relationships are between our sales representatives and our treating physicians, which include interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. We have developed systems and processes to harness the information gained from these relationships and we leverage this information to rapidly iterate products, introduce and execute physician education and training programs and scale our sales organization. We market and sell our products to hospitals, which are reimbursed by various third-party payors.
 We have dedicated meaningful resources to building a direct sales force in the United States, with our sales force covering 120 territories as of December 31, 2020.  We continue to actively expand our sales organization through additional sales representatives and territories. 
 We have experienced significant growth since we began commercializing our products in the United States. We generated revenue of $139.7 million, with a gross margin of 90.6% and net income of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to revenue of $51.1 million, with a gross margin of 88.4% and net losses of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our accumulated deficit was $27.4 million as of December 31, 2020.

Our Success Factors
 We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:
  
• | Focus on and deep understanding of the venous system and venous diseases. We are pioneering the development and commercialization of devices that are designed and purpose-built for the specific characteristics of the venous system, its diseases and its unique clot morphology. Treatment of the venous system and its diseases presents a different set of challenges and requirements than the arterial system, and represents a new frontier for the application of catheter-based solutions. Historically, development efforts have focused on repurposing arterial devices for use in the venous system. Given the significant differences between the arterial and venous systems, these efforts have largely been ineffective in treating VTE. Our focus on the venous system and deep knowledge of our target market has enabled us to understand the unmet needs of our patients and physicians. This has allowed us to rapidly innovate and enhance our products and has informed our clinical and educational programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary devices designed to safely and effectively remove large volumes of clot from large vessels while eliminating the need for thrombolytic drugs. Our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products are minimally-invasive devices designed to remove large volumes of clot from the venous system, without the use of thrombolytic drugs. They work simply, safely and effectively, and facilitate short, single-session treatments for both DVT and PE. Historically, patients suffering from DVT and PE were primarily treated with anticoagulants, which are drugs designed to prevent further blood clotting but that do not break down or eliminate existing clots. Other drug-based alternatives, including catheter-directed thrombolysis, are also used with limited effectiveness and, in some cases, with major bleeding. We believe our purpose-built venous thrombectomy products offer significant treatment benefits and have the potential to become the standard of care for DVT and PE.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large market opportunity for patients with unmet needs. In the United States, we estimate there are approximately 242,000 DVT patients and 200,000 PE patients each year that could benefit from treatment with our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products, respectively. We estimate that 68% of these target DVT patients and 90% of these target PE patients are treated with conservative medical management involving anticoagulants alone, which do not break down or eliminate existing clot. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need for safe and effective treatment and removal of existing clot in patients with these diseases. In addition, we believe there are approximately 20,000 patients with clot in transit in the right atrium who could benefit from treatment with FlowTriever products. We believe the historical bias for conservative medical management is largely due to the ineffectiveness of, and risks associated with, current alternative treatments, and the lack of mechanical tools capable of removing venous clot in a safe, effective and simple way. The standard of care for treatment of other thrombotic diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, has evolved from the use of anticoagulants alone to anticoagulants together with thrombolytic drugs and eventually to anticoagulants together with definitive catheter-based interventions. We believe that our products could be the catalyst to drive the same evolution of treatment for venous diseases. We estimate the potential annual total addressable market for our products in the United States is approximately $3.8 billion and that there is also a significant opportunity for our products outside the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly scaling commercial organization leveraging unique insights. Our most important relationships are between our sales representatives and physicians. Our front-line sales representatives typically attend procedures, which puts us at the intersection of the patient, product and physician. We have developed systems and processes to harness the information gained from these interactions and we leverage this information to rapidly iterate products, introduce and execute physician education and training programs and scale our sales organization. We are rapidly expanding our network of sales representatives and, as of December 31, 2020, we had 120 sales territories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple, intuitive and easy to use products with minimal training required. Our products are minimally invasive, easy to use, single-use devices that do not require capital equipment or the use of thrombolytic drugs. We designed and developed our products to enable a short learning curve and consistent ease of use. Our products are designed to utilize standard endovascular skills possessed by our treating physicians, interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons, each of which
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

can readily learn the required additional techniques for use of our products. We believe this simplicity and ease of use will continue to help drive adoption of our products.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compelling hospital economics and improved hospital and physician efficiency. We believe our products can reduce the cost of treating DVT and PE. We designed our products to eliminate the need for expensive thrombolytic drugs. These drugs require a costly ICU stay and carry a significant risk of major bleeding. Our products facilitate short, single-session treatments and we believe have the potential to reduce the total length of hospital stay and improve hospital economics. In addition, our products can drive hospital and physician efficiency. We believe these economic benefits support the approval of our products by hospital value analysis committees, group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks, which reduces a key barrier to adoption by our physician customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unique culture of focus on patient care, driving value creation. We believe that VTE patients have been poorly understood, under treated and mostly ignored by industry participants. Our key purpose is to serve and improve the quality of life of these patients, our patients. We believe that the clot itself matters and that removing it can have a profound impact on the lives of our patients over the short and long term. We believe it is our responsibility to ensure as many of our patients as possible are treated safely, effectively and simply. We have implemented hiring and recruiting systems to carefully select professionals who share our beliefs and goals. We believe that extraordinary outcomes are possible when a group of people commit, together, to ideas and purposes bigger than themselves and bigger than business. We pursue our key purpose with a team of people who commit themselves to a cause and to each other.

Our Growth Strategy
 Our mission is to treat and transform the lives of patients suffering from venous diseases. To accomplish this, we intend to establish our products as the standard of care for the treatment of venous diseases. The key elements of our growth strategy are:

• | Continuing to expand our U.S. sales force. We currently sell our products to over 800 of the approximately 1,500 hospitals in the United States with a catheterization laboratory, or cath lab, where interventional procedures can be performed. VTE patients present to, and can be treated at, any of these hospitals, whereas some other diseases, such as stroke, require referrals to tertiary care facilities for advanced treatment. We plan to continue to grow our sales organization in order to target and expand our network of hospital and physician customers, and believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business through this continued expansion of our commercial footprint.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Driving increased awareness and adoption of our products in existing and future hospital customers. As we expand our network of hospital customers, we intend to increase awareness within these hospitals in order to drive greater adoption of our products as the preferred first-line solution for the treatment of venous diseases. To accomplish this, we conduct regular national, regional and local training and educational programs for both interventional and non-interventional physicians. In addition, we are leveraging our expanding sales organization to increase the awareness of our products with our treating physicians, referring physicians and other stakeholders at the account level. Our goal is to increasingly drive towards small sales territories that allow for deeper engagement within existing hospital customers. This strategy enables our sales representatives to have regular and targeted communications to convey the benefits of our products to non-interventional physicians, such as emergency department physicians and pulmonologists. These physicians often play an important role in helping to determine patient care. We also train our sales representatives to communicate the clinical and economics of our products with hospital administrators. We believe this comprehensive approach is key to continuing to drive increased adoption of our products within existing and new hospital customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Building upon our base of clinical evidence. We are committed to continuing to build upon our base of clinical evidence, which we believe will help drive increased awareness and adoption of our products. The primary clinical study we have completed to date is our FLARE study, which established the safety and effectiveness of the FlowTriever for the treatment of PE without the use of thrombolytic drugs. We are currently enrolling two 500-patient registries, CLOUT for DVT and FLASH for PE, and we expect to initiate the FLAME registry for high-risk PE in 2021. In addition, there are multiple ongoing

investigator-initiated studies. We believe these studies will generate a robust cadence of publications, drive further adoption of our products, increase awareness of venous diseases and inform the design of future definitive clinical trials.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to expand our portfolio of venous products. We are currently focused on three key goals as we develop additional and next generation venous products for commercialization. First, we seek to continue to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and ease of use of our current products. Second, we plan to expand the application of our thrombectomy technology to areas of the body that are not addressed by our existing products. Third, we are developing solutions beyond thrombectomy to address other unmet needs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing strategically adjacent markets and international opportunities. We believe there is an opportunity to leverage our commercial footprint to expand beyond venous into adjacent vascular markets. In addition, venous diseases are prevalent worldwide, and we believe there is a significant opportunity for our products outside the United States. We are currently working to commercialize our solutions internationally and have received updated CE Marks for both ClotTriever and FlowTriever in Europe.

Market Overview
 Our Market
 Industry sources estimate that approximately 668,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with DVT each year. Of these, approximately 242,000 patients, or 38%, have DVT located in the iliofemoral region and are candidates for treatment using our ClotTriever product. We believe the ClotTriever offers an innovative solution for these 242,000 patients that is safe and more effective than current treatment alternatives, and that this represents an approximately $1.6 billion per year U.S. market opportunity for DVT. In addition, among the 668,000 DVT patients, we believe there are approximately 20,000 patients with clot in transit in the right atrium who could benefit from treatment with FlowTriever products.
 Industry sources estimate that approximately 400,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with PE each year. Of these, approximately 200,000 patients, or 50%, have PE that is severe enough to cause right heart strain. We believe the FlowTriever offers an innovative solution for these 200,000 patients that is safe and more effective than current treatment alternatives, and that this represents an approximately $2.0 billion per year U.S. market opportunity for PE. 
 Collectively, the potential annual addressable U.S. market for our current products is approximately $3.8 billion. We also believe there is a substantial market opportunity for DVT and PE outside the United States.
 Venous and Arterial Systems and Clot Morphology
 The vascular system is made up of vessels that carry and circulate blood throughout the body. The system consists of the arterial system, a network of vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, and the venous system, a network of vessels that return blood from the body back to the heart. The arterial system is characterized by high velocity blood flow under high pressure. As blood moves through arteries to the body, arteries gradually taper in the direction of blood flow and branch off into smaller vessels, terminating in capillaries. Venous blood flow travels at a lower velocity and under lower pressure than arterial blood flow. Veins carry blood back to the heart and, as a result, enlarge in the direction of blood flow. Due to these important differences, the clinical presentation and clot morphology of venous diseases differ significantly from arterial diseases. As a result, VTE presents a specific set of challenges and corresponding requirements for effective treatment solutions.
 Due to the characteristics of the arterial system, clot that forms in arteries quickly becomes occlusive, which causes sudden and dramatic symptoms that require the patient to quickly seek medical attention. Examples of conditions caused by arterial clot include myocardial infarction, or MI, and stroke. As these clots are discovered quickly and in smaller vessels, they are small, soft, fibrin-rich and are usually not adhered to the wall of the artery. For example, arterial clot that causes MI or stroke is generally about the size of a grain of rice. 
 8

Due to the characteristics of the venous system, the volume of venous clot gradually increases and adheres to the vessel wall, growing inwards towards the center of the vessel (thicker) and along the vessel wall (longer), further restricting blood flow through the affected vein. Venous clot can develop over days or weeks before causing symptoms severe enough to prompt the patient to seek medical attention. During this time, as venous clot ages, its fibrin composition is rapidly replaced by a firmer collagen matrix. For example, according to a published study, the collagen content of a clot can reach 20% within one week and 80% within three weeks. The body’s natural mechanisms for breaking down and removing clot targets fibrin. Therefore, as a clot ages it generally becomes more resistant to the body’s natural ability to break down and eliminate it. As a result, by the time patients seek medical attention, their venous clot has likely become resistant to the natural mechanisms for treatment and quite significant in size.
 The following images depict examples of arterial and venous clots:
 

Venous Thromboembolism
 Venous thromboembolism, or VTE, is a disease caused by blood clot formation in the venous system. VTE has two distinct manifestations – deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, and pulmonary embolism, or PE. VTE is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and represents the third most common vascular diagnosis in the United States after myocardial infarction and stroke. According to industry sources, PE is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death in the United States and is the most common cause of preventable deaths in hospitals in the United States. Researchers estimate that there are up to approximately one million VTE patients in the United States each year. VTE results in approximately 296,000 deaths in the United States each year and industry sources estimate that VTE-related direct health care costs exceed $10 billion per year.
Deep Vein Thrombosis
 DVT occurs when clot forms in the deep veins of the extremities of the body, such as the legs. While DVT can occur in any deep vein, it commonly occurs in the iliac, femoral and popliteal veins, which are located in the pelvis, thigh and knee, respectively.

The image below depicts the location of DVT in the patient’s body:
 


A variety of factors can contribute to the development of clots that can cause DVT including: compression on the vein, surgery, trauma or bone fracture, long periods of bed rest, reduced blood flow from immobility, cancer, pregnancy, birth control pills and varicose veins. In addition, certain people are genetically predisposed for increased clotting. Typical symptoms of DVT include:
  
• | swelling in the foot, ankle or leg, usually on one side;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | cramping pain in the affected leg, usually beginning in the calf;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unexplained pain in the foot or ankle;
--+---------------------------------------


• | warm skin; and
--+---------------


• | discoloration of the skin, usually bluish or reddish.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 Upon presentation, DVT can be readily diagnosed via a standard ultrasound imaging assessment that is usually performed in the emergency room.
 Symptoms can persist and worsen over time if left untreated. In addition, the location of the DVT can have a significant impact on prognosis and the ability to treat the affected vein. For example, iliofemoral DVT is typically the most dangerous and has large clot volume, poor long-term prognosis and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Approximately 50% of patients suffering from DVT will develop post-thrombotic syndrome, or PTS, which is caused by chronic scarring and occlusion of vessels. PTS is a severe, lifestyle-limiting disease that is characterized by chronic pain, swelling and skin ulcers. Approximately 90% of patients with PTS are unable to work 10 years after diagnosis.
 10

Pulmonary Embolism
 PE occurs when a venous clot embolizes or becomes mobile, travels through the heart and gets lodged in the pulmonary arteries of the lungs. Venous clot that causes PE originates as DVT.
 The image below depicts the location of PE in the patient’s body:
 

A blood clot in the pulmonary arteries increases pressure in these vessels, which causes an increase in the workload of the heart. This initiates a cascade of events, leading to trouble breathing, chest pain, coughing blood, rapid heartbeat and passing out. Upon presentation, PE can be readily diagnosed via a computerized tomography, or CT, scan of the chest.
 The most serious complication associated with PE is death, usually due to cardiovascular collapse from sudden failure of the heart, specifically the right ventricle. As many as 50% of patients who survive have long-term residual pulmonary vascular obstruction due to the body’s inability to break down and eliminate the clot. These patients may experience significant impaired function of the heart and lungs, shortness of breath, reduced exercise capacity and lifestyle limitations. In addition, these patients have a statistically higher rate of recurrent PE, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and death.
 PE is often characterized and stratified based on risk to the patient. High risk, or massive, PE is characterized by right heart strain and low systemic blood pressure, and has a mortality rate of up to 50%. Intermediate risk, or submassive, PE is characterized by right heart strain with normal systemic blood pressure, and has a mortality rate of 12-15%. Low risk, or minor PE, has minimal risk of mortality. Approximately 5%, 45% and 50% of PE patients are categorized as high risk, intermediate risk and low risk, respectively.
 Current Treatment Alternatives and Their Limitations
 There are several treatment options for DVT and PE patients, ranging from conservative medical management to advanced catheter-based interventions. We estimate that 68% of our target DVT patients and 90% of our target PE patients are treated with anticoagulants alone. We estimate that the remaining 32% of our target DVT patients and 10% of our target PE patients also receive additional treatment beyond anticoagulation. These treatments 
 11

include mechanical thrombectomy, thrombolytic drugs and surgery. There is no consistent approach for determining whether a given patient receives anticoagulants alone or in conjunction with additional treatments. Due in part to the limitations and potential dangers of these additional treatments, most patients are treated with anticoagulation alone.
 Anticoagulant Drugs
 Conservative medical management with anticoagulant drugs is, and for several decades has been, the primary treatment for DVT and PE. Nearly all patients receive this treatment, many of whom remain on anticoagulants for the remainder of their lives. Anticoagulants do not break down or eliminate existing blood clots. Instead, anticoagulants are intended to stop the formation of additional blood clots and limit the growth of existing blood clots while the body attempts to break down and remove clots using natural mechanisms.
 Anticoagulation is often initiated intravenously on an inpatient basis and patients generally remain in the hospital for several days for monitoring while on these drugs. Once stabilized, the patient is transitioned to oral therapy with either Coumadin or a direct-acting oral anticoagulant, such as Eliquis or Xarelto, and is then discharged from the hospital. Patients can remain on these drugs for months or years, and some patients will remain on these drugs for the remainder of their lives.
 Mechanical Thrombectomy
 Mechanical thrombectomy is an interventional procedure in which a catheter is used to remove clot from vessels in the body, typically by aspiration. There are dozens of catheters available for this type of procedure, although these devices were almost all originally designed for use in the arterial system, which involves the removal of soft, small clots from small vessels. 
 Some mechanical thrombectomy devices use a hybrid approach that combines aspiration-based mechanical thrombectomy and localized delivery of thrombolytic drugs. 
 We believe there are a number drawbacks and limitations to existing mechanical thrombectomy treatment options and that existing options do not adequately treat VTE for several reasons, including:
  
• | Limited ability to remove large, older clots. Due to the characteristics of the venous system and venous clot morphology, by the time VTE is diagnosed, the underlying clot can be significant in size and hardened. Most current mechanical thrombectomy devices are designed to aspirate fresher arterial clot, which is small and soft. As a result, these devices can be inadequate and ineffective for removing the larger, older clots associated with VTE.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited ability to remove clot from the vessel wall. Unlike arterial clots, venous clots attach to the vessel wall. Most current mechanical thrombectomy products are aspiration-based systems. Aspiration alone does not always liberate venous clot from the vessel wall. As a result, while some clot can be removed by aspiration, significant residual clot can remain in the vein following aspiration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased safety risks. Rheolytic-based aspiration systems create a risk of damage to red blood cells due to the high shear forces involved with the therapy. These damaged cells can in turn cause a slow heart rate, low blood pressure and kidney dysfunction. For example, one rheolytic system has an FDA black box warning for the treatment of PE. For DVT, the duration of treatment with rheolytic systems is frequently limited to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-stage treatment with multiple procedures. Mechanical thrombectomy procedures are often performed as one part of a multi-stage treatment for DVT that is combined with thrombolytic drug therapy. Multi-stage treatment increases cost and decreases efficiency for the hospital, increases risk and inconvenience for the patient, and typically requires ICU stays and monitoring periods.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thrombolytic Drugs and Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis
 Thrombolytic drugs accelerate the body’s natural mechanisms for clearing clot by catalyzing the enzyme that breaks down the fibrin composition of clot. These drugs have demonstrated efficacy in breaking down newly-
 12

formed, fibrin-rich clot. However, thrombolytic drugs are generally not effective on older clot in which clot composition has changed from a fibrin matrix to a firmer collagen matrix.
 Treatment with thrombolytic drugs is associated with a risk of spontaneous major bleeding, including catastrophic bleeding in the brain. To address some of this risk, catheter-directed thrombolysis was developed to deliver a smaller dose of thrombolytic drug directly to the site of the clot. The catheter-directed procedure involves placing a small catheter into a vein, usually at the knee or groin, and through the clot. Thrombolytic drugs are then infused through the catheter into the clot for several hours to several days. Thrombolytic drugs are always delivered in a critical care setting, such as the ICU, due to the significant bleeding risk.
 We believe that thrombolytic drug therapy does not adequately treat VTE for several reasons, including:
  
• | Limited effectiveness in breaking down venous clot. We believe that thrombolytic drugs do not have a significant impact on venous clot. Due to the characteristics of the venous system and venous clot morphology, by the time thrombolytic drugs are administered, the composition of the underlying clot will often have changed from a fibrin matrix to a firmer collagen matrix. This transition in clot morphology generally begins early and progresses quickly. Thrombolytic drugs are generally not effective on this type of older clot, which means that all or a portion of the underlying clot can remain following treatment with thrombolytic drugs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Substantial risks of severe bleeding and contraindications. The overall rate of major bleeding with thrombolytic drugs is over 20%, including a 2-3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Lower dose catheter-directed thrombolysis can help to reduce this risk, however, major bleeding has been observed in up to 10% of patients who received catheter-based thrombolysis in studies in which patients were carefully selected for treatment. Thrombolytic drugs are contraindicated in up to 50% of VTE patients, including, among others, patients who are elderly, have had a recent surgery or stroke or that have active bleeds, which further limits their utility as a treatment option.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expensive, resource intensive and time consuming treatment. Treatment with thrombolytic drugs requires intensive monitoring of the patient in a critical care setting, such as the ICU. Further, catheter-directed thrombolysis can require ongoing treatment for several hours to several days as thrombolytic drugs are infused into the clot, the entirety of which is monitored in the ICU. This is inconvenient and uncomfortable for the patient, time consuming for the provider and expensive for the payor. In addition, ICU beds are in limited supply and high demand at many hospitals, so treatment with thrombolytic drugs can have important implications for hospitals, physicians and other critically ill patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Treatment Options 
 Other treatment options for DVT include stenting and intravascular filters to catch clot in the event that it embolizes. In addition, open surgical embolectomy is used in a very limited number of critical patients. Open surgical embolectomy is an invasive open chest surgery in which blood flow is stopped and a ventilator is used while surgeons physically remove clot from the patient. According to a published study, fewer than 250 open surgical embolectomy procedures are performed in the United States each year. 
Our Solution 
 We believe that the venous system represents the newest frontier for effective catheter-based mechanical treatments. The treatment of other thrombotic diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, has evolved from the use of anticoagulants to thrombolytic drugs and eventually to definitive catheter-based interventions. We believe this evolution has contributed to improved treatment outcomes and decreased mortality rates for these diseases. We believe this evolution of treatment to definitive catheter-based intervention has not yet occurred for VTE because existing devices do not safely and effectively remove venous clot. For example, while the number of annual PE diagnoses has generally increased over time, we believe existing treatment options have not had a meaningful impact on mortality rates. We believe our purpose-built ClotTriever and FlowTriever products offer significant clinical benefits and address the safety and effectiveness limitations of thrombolytic drugs and repurposed arterial devices for the treatment of VTE. We believe our products could be the catalyst to drive the evolution of treatment for VTE and have the potential to become the standard of care for treatment of VTE patients.

Key Benefits of our ClotTriever and FlowTriever Products 
 We believe the ClotTriever and FlowTriever are transformational devices that address the specific characteristics and requirements of the venous system and venous clot morphology and offer hospitals, physicians and patients the following key benefits:
  
• | Capture and remove large clot burden from large vessels. Our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products are mechanical thrombectomy devices specifically designed for the clinical and technical challenges of DVT and PE, respectively. As such, both systems are capable of capturing and removing the significant clot volumes associated with VTE from large vessels. The images below depict examples of results and clot volume removed from procedures using our products:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Liberate mechanically and remove venous clot from the vessel wall. As venous clot ages and its composition changes from a fibrin matrix to a firmer collagen matrix, the body begins to absorb the clot into the vessel wall and the clot becomes adhered, making it more difficult to remove. We have designed our products to address this challenge by incorporating unique components that enable them to mechanically engage and liberate the clot from the vessel wall and remove it from the body.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eliminate the need for thrombolytic drugs. Our products have been designed to remove large clot volumes from large vessels without the need for thrombolytic drugs. Treatment without thrombolytic drugs is beneficial for several important reasons. First, many patients who are contraindicated for use of thrombolytic drugs can potentially be treated with our products. Second, avoiding thrombolytic drugs
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

eliminates the significant risk of bleeding associated with these drugs. Third, thrombolytic drugs are usually administered by continuous infusion for several hours or days while the patient is monitored in the ICU, which is expensive. Patients treated using our products often avoid the ICU entirely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Remove clot safely with minimal blood loss. Our products have been used to treat more than 20,000 patients and have demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Our mechanical approach to clot removal helps to minimize bleeding complications associated with other treatment options.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offer simple, intuitive and easy to use solutions to physicians. We designed and developed our products to enable a short learning curve and consistent ease of use. Our products are designed to utilize standard endovascular skills possessed by our treating physicians, interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons, each of which can readily learn the required additional techniques for use of our products. In addition, our products employ mechanical and aspiration mechanisms of action that are already familiar to the operating physician.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable short, single-session treatment with improved hospital and physician efficiency. Our products are intended to facilitate short, single-session treatments, with the potential to reduce the length of ICU stay and total length of hospital stay. Both of our products are designed for multiple passes during the procedure to maximize clot removal. We estimate the average device usage time for treatment with the ClotTriever is between 30 and 45 minutes and the average procedure time for treatment with the FlowTriever is between 75 and 90 minutes. We believe these short, single-session treatments result in less discomfort and more convenience for the patient, lower costs for the hospital and more efficient workflow for both the hospital and the physician.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Require no capital investment. Both of our products are fully self-contained systems and do not require additional capital equipment to perform the procedure. This eliminates an important barrier to hospital adoption and makes the procedure simpler for the physicians and staff.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ClotTriever
 The ClotTriever is a mechanical thrombectomy system designed to core, capture and remove large clots from large vessels and is used to treat DVT. The ClotTriever is a single-use, sterile system that is deployed over a wire and does not require capital equipment. The ClotTriever is 510-(k) cleared by the FDA and CE Mark approved for the treatment of DVT. 
 The ClotTriever system consists of two components:
  
• | ClotTriever sheath – The ClotTriever sheath is a 15 cm sheath that features a self-expanding nitinol mesh funnel at its tip designed to maximize clot removal. The sheath is available in two sizes: 13 and 16 French. In addition, the sheath features a stopcock for aspiration and a hemostatic valve for catheter insertion. It is packaged with a custom designed large bore 60 cc syringe that fits the sheath’s wide flush/aspiration port to help facilitate effective aspiration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ClotTriever catheter – The ClotTriever catheter is designed to core and collect clot from the vessel wall for extraction through the ClotTriever sheath. The ClotTriever catheter is a catheter features an expandable nitinol coring element at its leading edge. A braided nitinol clot collection bag is attached behind the coring element and is designed to collect clot and provide embolic protection. The catheter has a working length of 80 cm and can accommodate vessels between 6-16 mm in diameter. The catheter handle has a mechanism that is used to apply tension to the coring element.

Procedure
 A ClotTriever procedure is performed in a cath lab, interventional suite or operating room. The patient is typically placed on his or her stomach on the procedure table. Using standard endovascular techniques, the procedure begins with a needle puncture in the back of the leg to gain access to the vein. A guidewire is inserted and advanced through the clot and is positioned beyond the clot. The ClotTriever sheath is then advanced over the guidewire and positioned in the vein in the back of the leg. Once in position, the self-expanding nitinol mesh funnel is deployed from the tip of the sheath. The funnel expands to the wall of the vein and helps to ensure efficient capture and removal of the clot. Next, the ClotTriever catheter is advanced over the guidewire and through the sheath. The catheter is advanced over the guidewire through the clot and is positioned beyond the clot for deployment.
 The catheter is then unsheathed to expose the self-expanding nitinol coring element and collection bag. Using the catheter’s handle mechanism, tension is then applied to the coring element, which expands to the wall of the vein. The catheter is then slowly retracted back towards the sheath, coring and liberating the clot from the vessel wall and capturing it within the collection bag, which provides embolic protection throughout the duration of the retraction. Clot removal is entirely mechanical, which minimizes blood loss and does not require the use of thrombolytic drugs or a stay in the ICU. The catheter is slowly retracted back through the diseased vessel until the 
 16

coring element of the catheter connects with the funnel of the sheath. Using the same handle mechanism, tension is then removed from the coring element and the catheter is withdrawn through the sheath. As the catheter enters the sheath, the clot is safely collapsed and elongated inside the collection bag. After the catheter has been fully removed from the body, any remaining clot particles in the sheath can be removed using aspiration.
 Once removed from the body, we have developed techniques that enable the efficient removal of clot from the catheter, which can then be reinserted for additional passes to remove more clot. There is an average of four passes per case. Upon completion of the treatment, the sheath is removed from the patient and the physician completes standard closure of the access site. We estimate the current average device usage time for the treatment with the ClotTriever to be between 30 and 45 minutes and that the ClotTriever removes an average of 80-90% of the target clot.
 Pricing
 The vast majority of ClotTriever procedures use a single ClotTriever catheter and single ClotTriever sheath. Each component is priced and packaged separately. 
 FlowTriever
 The FlowTriever is a large bore catheter-based aspiration and mechanical thrombectomy system designed to remove large clots from large vessels to treat PE. The FlowTriever is a single-use, sterile system that is deployed over a wire and does not require capital equipment. The FlowTriever is 510(k)-cleared by the FDA for the treatment of PE and for clot in transit in the right atrium, and CE Mark approved for the treatment of PE. 
 The FlowTriever consists of two main components:
  
• | Triever aspiration catheters – Triever aspiration catheters are highly trackable, large lumen catheters that provide a conduit for aspiration and clot removal. Triever aspiration catheters are available in three sizes, 16, 20 and 24 French. Our larger lumen Triever aspiration catheters can generate a higher rate of aspirational blood flow than small lumen catheters, as the wider catheter can carry more blood volume, at a lower resistance, than a narrower tube. Each Triever aspiration catheter is a single lumen catheter featuring a stopcock with a port designed for flush or aspiration, and a proximal hemostasis valve for catheter insertion, if needed. The Triever aspiration catheters are packaged with a custom designed large bore 60 cc syringe that fits the sheath’s wide flush/ aspiration port to facilitate effective aspiration and limit blood loss.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FlowTriever catheter – FlowTriever catheters are designed to engage, liberate and deliver the clot to the Triever aspiration catheter for extraction. FlowTriever catheters are delivered to the clot through the Triever aspiration catheter. Each FlowTriever catheter consists of a coaxial shaft and features three self-expanding nitinol mesh disks at its distal end that are designed to maximize clot liberation and removal. These disks are available in four sizes ranging from 6 to 25 millimeters in diameter.

Procedure
 A FlowTriever procedure is performed in a cath lab, interventional suite or operating room. The patient is typically placed on his or her back on the procedure table. Using standard endovascular techniques, the procedure begins with a needle puncture in a large vein in either the groin or the neck. A guidewire is inserted and advanced through the venous system, through the right side of the heart, and is passed through the target clot in the pulmonary artery. The large bore Triever aspiration catheter is then advanced over the guidewire to the target clot. Once the Triever aspiration catheter is in position, the stopcock on the back of the system is closed and the large bore 60 cc syringe is attached. The syringe is used to create a strong vacuum. Opening the stopcock releases the vacuum. This vacuum, when delivered through the large bore Triever aspiration catheter, creates a high flow aspiration, which we call the Whoosh, that draws clot into the Triever aspiration catheter. The flow volume is limited by the large bore 60 cc syringe, which helps to minimize blood loss. Multiple passes and aspirations are possible depending on the clot volume and number of vessels to be treated. We estimate the median blood loss from procedures using the FlowTriever to be 280 cc.
 If clot remains following aspiration, the FlowTriever catheter may be advanced through the Triever aspiration catheter to just beyond the clot. We estimate that the FlowTriever catheter is used in approximately 50- 60% of cases. Once in position, the FlowTriever catheter is unsheathed to deploy the self-expanding nitinol mesh disks into the clot. The FlowTriever catheter is then slowly pulled back toward the Triever aspiration catheter, disrupting the clot and delivering it to the Triever aspiration catheter. The Triever aspiration catheter can be used for further aspiration if needed.
 Upon completion of the treatment, all devices and wires are removed from the patient and the physician completes standard closure of the entry site. We estimate the average device usage time for treatment with a FlowTriever is between 40 and 50 minutes, the average procedure time for treatment with a FlowTriever is between 75 and 90 minutes, and that the FlowTriever removes an average of 75% of the target clot.
 Pricing
 The use of the FlowTriever system varies significantly based on the specific patient’s diagnosis and disease characteristics. For example, some patients are treated using aspiration alone and, as a result, the relevant procedure uses one or more Triever aspiration catheters but does not require a FlowTriever catheter. Other patients are treated using aspiration in combination with mechanical engagement of the clot, in which case the procedure uses one or more Triever aspiration catheters and one or more FlowTriever catheters. Due to the variability in use across procedures, we price the FlowTriever on a per procedure basis. As a result, a customer is charged the same price for each procedure that uses the FlowTriever system, regardless of what combination of products is used to treat the patient. We believe that this approach provides greater pricing certainty, can help to preserve hospital economics and emphasizes clinical considerations in determining device use for any given procedure. Each component is packaged separately.
 FlowTriever for DVT
 A portion of patients with DVT present with anatomical complexities and lesion types that require more involved procedures and techniques to treat their disease. In these cases, physicians may elect to use one or more components of our FlowTriever system to treat DVT, with or without the ClotTriever. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we estimate that approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, of our DVT procedures were performed using only our FlowTriever system and approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, of our DVT procedures were performed using our ClotTriever and at least one component of the FlowTriever system. We believe the cross-treatment application of our products reflects the complexity of venous disease, versatility of our product portfolio and the value of a comprehensive venous solution.

Clinical Data
 The primary clinical study we have completed to date is our FlowTriever Pulmonary Embolectomy Clinical Study, or FLARE study, which established the safety and effectiveness of the FlowTriever for the treatment of PE without the use of thrombolytic drugs. We are currently enrolling two 500-patient registries: CLOUT for DVT and FLASH for PE. In addition, we expect to initiate the FLAME registry for high-risk PE in 2021 and there are multiple ongoing investigator-initiated studies. 
 ClotTriever
 The FDA granted 510(k) clearance of the ClotTriever in February 2017 based on a determination that the ClotTriever was substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device and, in September 2020, granted 510-(k) clearance for the treatment of DVT. We were not required by the FDA to conduct clinical studies on the ClotTriever prior to seeking clearance. We are aware of a significant number of case reports, as well as independent research by various hospitals and researchers, that provide clinical evidence supporting the use of the ClotTriever. We are currently enrolling patients in the CLOUT registry to evaluate real-world patient outcomes using the ClotTriever in up to 500 patients.
 CLOUT Registry
 The CLOUT registry is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm registry designed to evaluate real-world patient outcomes and capture several longer term outcome measures. We plan to enroll up to 500 patients with lower extremity DVT at up to 50 sites across the United States. The registry will enroll all-comer patients, including patients with bilateral DVT and clots of any age, with a primary analytic dataset that will include 91 patients with unilateral DVT of less than six weeks’ duration. We believe data from the registry will generate a robust cadence of publications and, ultimately, will inform the design of future definitive clinical trials with the goal of establishing the ClotTriever as the standard of care for treatment of DVT. 
 Eligible patients must meet inclusion criteria specified for the registry. Generally, patients must exhibit lower extremity DVT affecting, alone or in combination, the femoral, common femoral, iliac veins or inferior vena cava, or IVC. Notably, there are no exclusions for age of clot. Patients will be excluded if they have received a prior venous stent in the target venous segment, have IVC aplasia or hypoplasia or other congenital anatomic anomalies of the IVC or iliac veins, have an IVC filter in place at the time of treatment, have allergy, hypersensitivity or thrombocytopenia from heparin or iodinated contrast agents that cannot be adequately pre-treated, have a life expectancy of less than one year, have long-term non-ambulatory status, have known hypercoagulability, which is the tendency to have or form clot as a result of inherited or acquired molecular defects, that cannot be medically managed throughout the study period or do not have an available lower extremity venous access site for the procedure.
 The primary outcome measures will be evaluated in the primary analytic dataset, which is expected to include 91 patients with unilateral DVT of less than 6 weeks’ duration. The primary safety endpoint is the composite of patients that experience major adverse events, including death, major bleeding, symptomatic PE or rethrombosis of the target venous segment, within 30 days of treatment using the ClotTriever. The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the rate of technical success from the procedure, which is defined as the complete or near complete (75% or greater) removal of clot from the target venous segment. Secondary safety outcomes that are also being reported include minor bleeding, access site complications and device and procedure-related death. Secondary effectiveness outcome measures include recurrent DVT and scores on various clinical symptom tests. In addition, there are follow-up visits for patients at up to two years from the date of treatment. 
 Interim results from the first 105 patients enrolled in the CLOUT registry study were presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Venous Forum, or AVF, in March 2020. These interim results, as of a January 17, 2020 cutoff date, included baseline and acute procedural outcomes in 105 patients and outcomes from 30-day follow-up in 68 patients. We believe these interim results provide evidence supporting the potential for the ClotTriever to successfully treat a range of clot in patients with DVT in a single session and without the need for thrombolytic drugs. For example, as of the cutoff date, clot was removed from all but one of the patients in a single session and, based on an evaluation conducted as of February 5, 2020, 70% of 59 evaluable patients met the study’s primary 
 19

effectiveness endpoint of complete or near complete (≥75%) removal of clot. Of the 65 patients for which follow-up data was collected regarding post-thrombotic syndrome, or PTS, 39 of the 61 patients that reported PTS at baseline (64%) showed no evidence of PTS at 30 days, and 60 out of all 65 patients evaluated for PTS (92%) showed improvement. No patients experienced severe disease within 30 days of treatment. Patients reported statistically significant improvements in disease severity, pain and quality of life scores within 30 days of treatment, with no device related major adverse events. Three patients (2.9%) had major adverse events within 30 days of treatment. Of these major adverse events, one patient died on day 23 after treatment because of sepsis and kidney failure associated with metastatic lung cancer (which was determined not to be procedure-related); one patient with previously documented extensive bilateral saddle PE prior to ClotTriever thrombectomy had symptomatic PE on day 2 after treatment (which was determined to be possibly procedure-related); and one patient had re-thrombosis on day 21 after treatment with incomplete thrombectomy and a Marder score reduction of 53.3% (which was determined to be procedure-related). No bleeding complications or renal injuries were reported and one wound complication, a hematoma, was reported. We believe these interim results are even more impressive given the complexity of the patient population. For example, over a quarter of the patients enrolled previously received alternative DVT treatment prior to treatment using the ClotTriever. In addition, almost two thirds of the patients enrolled had clots estimated to be more than two weeks old, which we believe represents a patient population that has never been previously studied for purposes of DVT thrombectomy. With the exception of one procedure, all patients were treated in a single session, with no patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, and the median thrombectomy time was 31 minutes.
 Below is a summary of the outcomes information presented at the AVF Annual Meeting in March 2020:

(1) | Villalta score is a disease score specific for post-thrombotic syndrome, or PTS, that is used to diagnose and categorize the severity of the condition. Points are provided for five symptoms (pain, cramps, heaviness, paresthesia and pruritus) and six clinical signs (pretibial edema, skin induration, hyperpigmentation, redness, venous ectasia and pain on calf compression). Points are based on severity and range from 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). Generally, a score of 5 or greater results in a PTS diagnosis, while a score of 5-9 signifies mild disease, 10-14 signifies moderate disease and 15 or greater, or the presence of an ulcer, signifies severe disease (n=65).

 FlowTriever
 The safety, effectiveness and clinical advantages of the FlowTriever have been observed in our first clinical trial, the FLARE study, and have also been observed in multiple post-market studies competed by various hospitals and research organizations. The FLARE study was conducted under an investigational device exemption, or IDE, approved by the FDA, and was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FlowTriever for use in the removal of clot from the pulmonary arteries and in the treatment of acute PE. The study supported the initial FDA 510(k) clearance for the FlowTriever. The results of the study were published in May 2019 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions. We are currently enrolling patients in the FlowTriever All-Comer Registry for Patient Safety and Hemodynamics, or FLASH registry, to evaluate real-world patient outcomes using the FlowTriever in up to 500 patients. 
 FLASH Registry
 The FLASH registry is a prospective, multi-center registry designed to evaluate real-world patient outcomes and capture several acute and longer term outcome measures. We plan to enroll up to 500 patients with intermediate and high risk PE at up to 50 sites across the United States. We believe data from the FLASH registry will generate a 
 21

robust cadence of publications and, ultimately, will inform the design of future definitive clinical trials with the goal of establishing the FlowTriever as the standard of care for treatment of PE. 
 Eligible patients must meet inclusion criteria specified for the registry. Generally, patients must exhibit clinical signs and symptoms consistent with acute PE and/or CT or pulmonary angiography evidence of proximal filling defect in at least one main or lobar pulmonary artery and be scheduled for treatment for PE using the FlowTriever at the investigator’s discretion. Patients will be excluded if they are unable to receive anticoagulant therapy, have known sensitivity to radiographic contrast agents that cannot be adequately pre-treated, have a life expectancy of less than 30 days or are participating in another investigational drug or device treatment study that would interfere with participation in the registry, or if imaging evidence or other evidence suggests that the patient is not appropriate for a catheter-based thrombectomy procedure.
 The primary outcome measure is the composite of patients that experience major adverse events, including device-related death, major bleeding, or device or procedure-related adverse events, in the 48 hours after treatment using the FlowTriever. Secondary safety outcomes that are also being reported include the rate of patients with individual components of composite major adverse events in the 48 hours after treatment and the rates of death and device-related serious adverse events within 30 days of treatment. Secondary effectiveness outcomes include change in pulmonary artery pressures, changes in a range of on-table hemodynamic measurements and utility measures, such as length of stay in the ICU and hospital. In addition, there are follow-up visits for patients at up to six months from the date of treatment.
 In October 2020, we announced positive results from the first 230 patients enrolled in the FLASH registry.  Of these patients, 98.7% (227/230) met the registry’s primary endpoint of freedom from major adverse events in the 48 hours after treatment using the FlowTriever. Secondary endpoints include impact on acute hemodynamics, procedural measures, 48-hour all-cause mortality and longer-term patient outcomes. All secondary outcome measures analyzed show statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline.  In addition, there were no deaths in the 48 hours after treatment, cardiac or pulmonary injuries or procedure-related clinical deteriorations. Further, there were no instances of intracranial hemorrhage, which is a limitation of treatment with thrombolytic drugs. Hemodynamic parameters, including pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac index improved significantly after treatment. The median duration of ICU stay was zero days following intervention.
 Immediate post-procedural hemodynamic improvements have not been demonstrated with thrombolytic-based approaches, which can take several hours to take effect.  After treatment using the FlowTriever, patient heart rates quickly improved by an average of 23 beats per minute. The majority (77%) of patients were tachycardic (>100 bpm) pre-procedure and 25% were tachycardic immediately after treatment. In addition, the average pulmonary artery pressure dropped by 7mmHg, with several patients normalizing immediately after clot removal.
 In November 2020, we announced positive follow-up results from these first 230 patients that were previously reported in October 2020 and for whom the study extended the follow-up period to 30 days after treatment with FlowTriever. At 30 days, one death (0.4%) was reported and the results showed a readmission rate of 6.7%. In contrast, the national PERT Consortium Quality Database recently showed 30-day mortality rates of 25.9% and 6.1% for high- and intermediate-risk PE patients and a readmission rate of nearly 25%. Efficacy data was also positive and showed normalization or near normalization in a battery of hemodynamic variables, such as pulmonary artery pressure, RV/LV ratio and heart rate, as well as dyspnea (shortness of breath) metrics.  
 FLARE Study
 Our first clinical trial, the FLARE study, was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter IDE study conducted at 18 sites across the United States from April 2016 to October 2017. The study evaluated the treatment of 106 patients with intermediate risk PE using the first generation FlowTriever. The study met both of its primary endpoints, which demonstrated safety and effectiveness and represented what we believe to be the first demonstration of successful treatment of PE without the use of thrombolytic drugs or its consequent ICU stay. Data from the study supported the initial FDA 510(k) clearance for the FlowTriever.
 All patients enrolled in the study were symptomatic for 14 days or fewer, with clinical signs and presentation consistent with PE, including documented proximal PE by computed tomography, or CT, angiography, and a site-
 22

reported right ventricle/left ventricle, or RV/LV, ratio of 0.9 or greater by CT. Patients were required to have a stable heart rate and systolic blood pressure and to be deemed medically eligible for an interventional procedure. Patients were excluded for use of thrombolytic drugs within 30 days of their CT angiography for the study, active cancer and contraindication to anticoagulant therapy. Patients with recent surgery and other high bleeding risks were not excluded.
 The primary effectiveness endpoint was a reduction in core laboratory-assessed RV/LV ratio. The average RV/LV ratio decreased from 1.53 (n = 104) at baseline assessment to 1.15 (n = 101) in the 48 hours after treatment using the FlowTriever, representing a statistically significant reduction in RV/LV ratio of 0.38 on average (25.1%; p < 0.0001).
 The primary safety endpoint was measured by device-related death, major bleeding, treatment-related clinical deterioration, pulmonary vascular injury or cardiac injury in the 48 hours after treatment using the FlowTriever. Four patients (3.8%) experienced six major adverse events in the 48 hours after treatment. All major adverse events were determined to be procedure related, with no device-related major adverse events. All four (3.8%) patients exhibited clinical deterioration. There was one major bleeding event (0.9%) and one pulmonary vascular injury. The major bleeding event experienced by one patient was also classified as a pulmonary vascular injury and as clinical deterioration. Two patients (1.9%) experienced respiratory deterioration during or immediately after the procedure that required emergent intubation. One patient (0.9%) became agitated during the procedure, requiring increased sedation, and had a ventricular fibrillation event that required cardioversion and emergent intubation. An additional 10 patients experienced serious adverse events within 30 days after treatment, none of which were determined to be procedure or device-related. In total, 14 patients (13.2%) experienced 26 serious adverse events within 30 days, with five patients (4.7%) experiencing multiple serious adverse events. One patient (0.9%) died within 30 days of treatment because of respiratory failure from undiagnosed metastatic breast cancer. The mean procedure time was 94 minutes.
 The FLARE study also provided evidence supporting other potential advantages of the FlowTriever. Only two patients (1.9%) in the study were administered thrombolytic drugs. Further, the average ICU stay of patients enrolled in the study was 1.5 days and 41.3% of patients did not go to the ICU. The average total hospital stay for patients enrolled in the study was 4.1 days.
 Other Studies
 There are a number of additional investigator-initiated studies being conducted to evaluate, among others, clot morphology, healthcare economics and long-term implications involving VTE. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We currently sell our products to over 800 of the approximately 1,500 hospitals in the United States with a cath lab where interventional procedures can be performed. Our treating physicians are interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. As we expand our network of hospital customers and leverage our expanding sales organization, we seek to increase awareness within these hospitals and with our treating physicians, referring physicians and other stakeholders at the account level in order to drive greater adoption of our products as the preferred first-line solution for the treatment of venous diseases. This strategy enables our sales representatives to have regular and targeted communications to convey the benefits of our products to non-interventional physicians, such as emergency department physicians and pulmonologists. To accomplish this, we conduct regular national, regional and local training and educational programs for both interventional and non-interventional physicians. In 2020 we launched our online education portal and expanded our physician outreach and training with the launch of our Clot Warrior Academy, which consists of a series of live webinars. 
 We have dedicated meaningful resources to building a direct sales force in the United States and we are actively expanding our sales organization through additional sales representatives and territories. We have 510(k) clearance in the United States and have obtained CE Marks in Europe for both our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products. 
 23

We recruit sales representatives who have substantial and applicable medical device and/or sales experience. Our most important relationships are between our sales representatives and physicians. Our front-line sales representatives typically attend procedures, which puts us at the intersection of the patient, product and physician. We have developed systems and processes to harness information gained from these interactions and we leverage this information to rapidly iterate products, introduce and execute physician education and training programs and scale our sales organization. We continue to expand our network of sales representatives and as of December 31, 2020, we had 120 sales territories.
 Our products are simple, intuitive and easy to use, and do not require significant additional training. They are designed to utilize standard endovascular skills. Our treating physicians can readily learn the required additional techniques for use of our products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States, we sell our products to hospitals. Hospitals in turn bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, for the total healthcare services required to treat the patient. Government agencies, private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and to reimburse hospitals for inpatient treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis-related group, or DRG, as determined by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. The fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed, and is unrelated to the specific medical device used in that procedure. Medicare rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, most use coverage and payment by Medicare as a benchmark by which to make their own decisions.
 ClotTriever
 Procedures using our ClotTriever product are categorized under CPT code 37187 for venous mechanical thrombectomy procedures. The primary ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for DVT is I82.40. The MS-DRGs are 270 when the patient presents with major complications or co-morbidities, 271 when the patient presents with a complication or co-morbidity, and 272 for patients without complications or co-morbidities.
 FlowTriever
 Procedures using our FlowTriever product are categorized under CPT code 37184 under arterial, noncoronary, mechanical thrombectomy procedures. The primary ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for PE is I26.9. The MS-DRGs are 163 when the patient presents with major complications or co-morbidities, 164 when the patient presents with a complication or co-morbidity, and 165 for patients without complications or co-morbidities.
 We understand that in 1983, CMS adopted a National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for Transvenous Pulmonary Embolectomy, NCD 240.6. At that time, NCD 240.6 deemed pulmonary embolectomy to be experimental and non-covered by Medicare. NCD 240.6 does not have a published effective date, does not provide any details about the non-covered procedure or devices, and does not cite any of the factors or evidence that was used to establish non-coverage. Since that time, technology and clinical practices related to embolectomy have changed significantly. We also understand that multiple physician societies have requested that CMS remove NCD 240.6.
 While NCD 240.6 is published, CMS approved Medicare coverage for FlowTriever procedures performed in connection with our FLARE study under Medicare’s Category B IDE coverage policy and hospitals have continued to perform FlowTriever procedures. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Catheter-based treatment for PE is subject to a Medicare National Coverage Determination that may restrict Medicare coverage for procedures using our FlowTriever product for the treatment of PE.”

Research and Development
 We are dedicated to the treatment of venous disease and are committed to driving innovation for the treatment of VTE, including DVT and PE. We believe our ability to develop innovative products for the treatment of VTE is attributable to our focus on the venous system, the design philosophy and product innovation process that we have implemented, our efforts to leverage and expand our clinical evidence and the insights that we have gained from our work in developing our products to date. Our engineering team has broad mechanical and biomedical engineering, project management, materials science, design and prototyping expertise.
 Our research and development effort is informed by near real-time field-based input from our sales organization, physicians and the direct field experience of our engineers. This process has allowed us to rapidly innovate and enhance our products. 
 We are currently focused on three key goals as we develop additional and next generation venous products for commercialization. First, we seek to continue to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and ease of use of our current products. Second, we plan to expand the application of our thrombectomy technology to areas of the body that are not addressed by our existing products. Third, we are developing solutions beyond thrombectomy to address other unmet needs.
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our research and development expenses were $18.4 million, $7.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We currently manufacture and assemble our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products at our approximately 40,000 square foot facility in Irvine, California. We also inspect, test, package and ship finished products from this facility. We have intentionally pursued a vertically integrated manufacturing strategy. We believe this offers important advantages, including rapid product iteration and control over our product quality. Although we believe our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our current expected demand for at least the next 12 months, we have entered into a lease agreement for a larger facility in Irvine, California to accommodate our growth plans.
 We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and are licensed by the State of California to manufacture and distribute our medical devices. We are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections and may also inspect the facilities of our suppliers. We moved to our current Irvine, California facility in November 2019, which has been registered with the FDA and was approved by the State of California for the manufacture and distribution of medical devices in October 2019. The FDA conducted its most recent inspection in August 2016. This inspection was conducted at our prior facility, which was also located in Irvine, California. The FDA has not conducted an inspection at our current facility.
 We have received International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 13485:2016 certification for our quality management system. ISO certification generally includes recertification audits every third year, scheduled annual surveillance audits and periodic unannounced audits. The most recent recertification audit was conducted in November 2020.  One major non-conformity was identified that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the notified body in January 2021. There have been no surveillance audits or unannounced audits on our new facility. 
 We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally-sourced components to produce our ClotTriever and FlowTriever products. Externally-sourced components include off-the-shelf materials, sub-assemblies and custom parts that are provided by approved suppliers. Almost all of these components, including the nitinol coring element of the ClotTriever, are provided by single-source suppliers. While there are other suppliers that could make or provide any one of our externally-sourced components, we seek to manage single-source supplier risk by regularly assessing the quality and capacity of our suppliers, implementing supply and quality agreements where appropriate and actively managing lead times and inventory levels of sourced components. In addition, we are currently in the process of identifying and approving alternative suppliers to dual or multi-source certain of our components. We generally seek to maintain sufficient supply levels to help mitigate any supply interruptions and enable us to find and qualify another source of supply. For certain components, we estimate that it would take up to 
 25

six months to find and qualify a second source. Order quantities and lead times for externally sourced components are based on our forecasts, which are derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the materials, sub-assemblies and parts.
 Our suppliers are evaluated, qualified and approved as part of our supplier quality program, which includes verification and monitoring procedures to ensure that our suppliers comply with FDA and ISO standards as appropriate, as well as our own specifications and requirements. We inspect and verify externally sourced components under strict processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We maintain a rigorous change control policy to assure that no product or process changes are implemented without our prior review and approval.
 Our finished products are ethylene oxide sterilized at a local, qualified supplier.
 Competition
 The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. We compete with manufacturers of thrombolytic drugs, such as Roche, and with medical device companies that manufacture thrombectomy devices and systems used to treat vascular blockages. These systems include water jets, ultrasonic acoustic field generators, aspirators, catheters and others. Our primary medical device competitors are Boston Scientific Corporation, Penumbra, AngioDynamics, Teleflex, Shandong Weigao and smaller companies that have single products or a limited range of products. There is growing interest in treatment of VTE with catheter-based solutions, and there are a significant number of approved thrombectomy devices available. As this interest continues to grow, we anticipate that this competition will intensify.
 Many of our competitors have longer, more established operating histories, and significantly greater name recognition and financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources. In addition, certain competitors have several competitive advantages, including established treatment patterns pursuant to which drugs are generally first-line or concurrent therapies for the treatment of VTE and established relationships with hospitals and physicians who prescribe their drugs or are familiar with existing interventional procedures for the treatment of VTE.
 We compete primarily on the basis that our solutions are designed specifically for the venous system and are able to treat patients with DVT and PE safely, effectively and without the need for thrombolytic drugs and their related costs and complications. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including patient outcomes and adverse event rates, patient experience and treatment time, acceptance by hospitals, physicians and referral sources, ease-of-use and reliability, patient recovery time and level of discomfort, economic benefits and cost savings, availability of reimbursement and the strength of clinical data and supporting evidence. One of the major hurdles to adoption of our products will be overcoming established treatment patterns, which will require education of referral sources and physicians and supportive clinical data.
 Intellectual Property
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and protective contractual provisions with our employees, contractors, consultants, suppliers, partners and other third parties to protect our intellectual property rights.
 As of December 31, 2020, we held 19 U.S. patents, which are expected to expire between November 2032 and April 2037, 17 pending U.S. patent applications, four issued foreign patents, 16 pending foreign patent applications and four pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, excluding our licensed and sublicensed patents. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a 
 26

nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. Our patents include a number of claims related to our systems, future concepts for our products and methods for treating vascular occlusions and embolisms.
 As of December 31, 2020, we also licensed two U.S. patents and sublicensed one U.S. patent related to braiding elements of our product designs, such as the tubular braiding of our clot collection bag. The licensed U.S. patent is expected to expire in October 2037 and is licensed pursuant to an amended and restated technology agreement, dated March 2, 2018, between Inceptus Medical, LLC, or Inceptus, and us. The license is a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free license in the field of the treatment of embolism and thrombosis in human vasculature other than carotid arteries, coronary vasculature and cerebral vasculature. The sublicensed U.S. patent is expected to expire in March 2030 and is sublicensed pursuant to a sublicense agreement, dated August 1, 2019, between Inceptus and us. Pursuant to the sublicense agreement, Inceptus granted us a non-transferable, worldwide, exclusive sublicense to its licensed intellectual property related to the tubular braiding for the non-surgical removal of clots and treatment of embolism and thrombosis in human vasculature other than carotid arteries, coronary vasculature and cerebral vasculature. Inceptus licensed this intellectual property pursuant to an intellectual property license agreement, dated May 4, 2018, between Inceptus and Drexel University.
 There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents and we have not received any notices of any patent infringement.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had eight registered trademarks and seven pending trademark applications worldwide, including trademark registration for “Inari Medical” in the United States and trademark registrations for “FlowTriever” and “ClotTriever” in the United States and other countries.
 Our pending patent and trademark applications may not result in issued patents or trademarks, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents or trademarks will protect our intellectual property rights, provide us with any competitive advantage or withstand or retain its original scope after a validity or enforceability challenge from a third party. While there is no active litigation involving any of our patents or other intellectual property rights and we have not received any notices of patent or other intellectual property infringement, we may be required to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against third parties in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
 Sublicense Agreement with Inceptus Medical, LLC
 In August 2019, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Inceptus, pursuant to which Inceptus granted us a non-transferable, worldwide, exclusive sublicense to its licensed intellectual property rights related to the tubular braiding for the non-surgical removal of clots and treatment of embolism and thrombosis in human vasculature other than carotid arteries, coronary vasculature and cerebral vasculature; such rights were originally granted to Inceptus pursuant to an intellectual property license agreement with Drexel University, or Drexel License, under which Drexel retained certain rights to use, and to permit other non-commercial entities to use, the sublicensed intellectual property for educational and non-commercial research purposes. The sublicense is also subject to all applicable U.S. government rights, and we cannot be sure that some of our intellectual property will be free from government rights or regulations pursuant to the Bayh-Doyle Act. Furthermore, we are obligated to comply with, and to avoid acts or omissions that would reasonably be likely to cause a breach of, the Drexel License. Our sublicense from Inceptus may only be sublicensed with the prior written approval of Inceptus and Drexel University.
 Pursuant to the sublicense agreement, we paid Inceptus reimbursement and milestone fees shortly after signing, and are obligated to pay an ongoing quarterly administration fee of $29,250 per quarter. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Inceptus on a quarterly basis an ongoing royalty calculated as the greater of a low-single digit percentage of net sales of products utilizing the licensed intellectual property and $1,500. The sublicense agreement specifies that our obligations to pay the quarterly administration fee and low-single digit royalty will terminate, and the licensed rights under the Drexel License will become fully paid-up and royalty and payment free if, pursuant to the terms of the Drexel License, Drexel University fails to provide timely written consent to Inceptus to join Drexel University to any patent infringement action for which Drexel University is a legally indispensable party.
 27

The sublicense agreement will continue until the expiration of the sublicensed patent, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement. We may terminate the sublicense agreement at any time by providing prior written notice. Inceptus may terminate the sublicense agreement if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the sublicensed intellectual property, in the event of our uncured material breach, in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency-related events, if we cease bona fide development and commercialization efforts for a specified period or if we are late in making our obligated payments under the agreement. The Drexel License includes similar term and termination provisions in respect of Inceptus and Drexel University.
 Amended and Restated Technology Agreement with Inceptus Medical, LLC
 In March 2018, we entered into an amended and restated technology agreement with Inceptus. Pursuant to this agreement, Inceptus granted us a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free license to certain of its intellectual property related to the braiding and aspiration controller technologies underlying its patent for the treatment of embolism and thrombosis in human vasculature other than carotid arteries, coronary vasculature and cerebral vasculature, or the defined field. As consideration, we granted Inceptus a license to use our intellectual property on reciprocal terms for use outside the defined field. These cross-licenses are perpetual and irrevocable. Neither party owes any payments to each other. We have the right to assign or transfer the amended and restated technology agreement to an entity in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our business.
Government Regulation
 Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA.
United States Regulation
 The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents.
 While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are 
 28

unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. Our currently marketed products are Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance.
 510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
 Our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2021, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification application is $12,432.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk- based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo request or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained, or a de novo request is granted. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
 More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
 29

PMA Approval Pathway
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA applications are also subject to the payment of user fees, which for fiscal year 2021 includes a standard application fee of $365,657.
 The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. None of our products are currently marketed pursuant to a PMA.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as 
 30

animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
 Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 Post-market Regulation
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31

 
• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut- down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.

Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union 
 The European Union has adopted specific directives regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigations, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. EU directives must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states and national laws may vary from one member state to another. 
 In the EU, there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices. However, the EU requires that all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the EU Medical Devices Directive. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement. 
 32

To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are often separate entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. 
 As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.
 On May 25, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745) entered into force, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable, without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them, in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
 The Medical Devices Regulation was originally intended to become effective three years after publication, but in April 2020, the transition period was extended by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU by an additional year – until May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025. Once effective, the new regulations will among other things:
  
• | Strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union, or EU; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strengthen the rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33

These modifications may have an effect on the way we design and manufacture products and how we conduct our business in the EEAEU.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Following the end of the “Brexit” Transition Period, from 1 January 2021 onwards, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) will be responsible for the UK medical device market. The new regulations will require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers will be given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process). Manufacturers based outside the UK will need to appoint a UK Responsible Person to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. By July 1, 2023, in the UK (England, Scotland, and Wales), all medical devices will require a UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) mark but CE marks issued by EU Notified Bodies will remain valid until this time. However, UKCA marking alone will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in the UK.
 Healthcare Regulatory Laws
 Within the United States, our products and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by a wide range of federal and state agencies that govern business practices in the medical device industry. These laws include federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency and anti-corruption statutes and regulations. Internationally, other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services.
 U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws generally apply to our activities because our products are covered under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute is particularly relevant because of its broad applicability. Specifically, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent in order to violate it. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Insurance companies may also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
 Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal Civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Various states have also enacted false claim laws analogous to the Civil False Claims Act, 
 34

although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, among other things, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent in order to violate them. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (as defined by statute), certain other healthcare providers beginning in 2022 and teaching hospitals, certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Additional laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers; require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with voluntary compliance standards issued by industry associations and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.
 Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the procedures using our products are covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and results.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product or procedure may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product or procedure. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or procedure. Adequate 
 35

third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to ensure profitability.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was signed into law and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year which has been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny, including increasing legislative and enforcement interest, over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 Data Privacy and Security
 Medical device companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
 In addition, certain state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.
 36

Additionally, the EU also has laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use and processing of personal data obtained from individuals in the EU, namely the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. These regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States and may restrict transfers of personal data to the United States unless certain requirements are met. The GDPR provides that EU and European Economic Area, or EEA, member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with these obligations could expose us to significant fines.
 Human Capital Resources and Employees
 We employ a growing and highly-skilled employee base across all employee functions and promote a culture focused on patient care in the treatment of VTE. Our key purpose is to serve and improve the quality of life of these patients, our patients. We believe that removing clot can have a profound impact on the lives of our patients over the short and long term, and that it is our responsibility to ensure as many of our patients as possible are treated safely, effectively and simply. We have implemented hiring and recruiting systems to carefully select professionals who share our beliefs and goals. We believe that extraordinary outcomes are possible when a group of people commit, together, to ideas and purposes bigger than themselves and bigger than business. We pursue our key purpose with a team of people who commit themselves to a cause and to each other.
 Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 456 employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
