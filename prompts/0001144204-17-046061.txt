Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage specialty healthcare company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing novel products in the field of urology. We have multiple urology-focused products on the market, and we seek to build a portfolio of novel therapeutics that serve large medical needs in the field of urology. We are concentrating on hypogonadism, prostate cancer, male infertility and, recently, female sexual wellbeing and intimacy and plan to expand into other urological indications for which we believe there are significant medical needs.
 
We acquired exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto® (testosterone) nasal gel, a novel formulation of testosterone delivered via a discreet, easy-to-use nasal gel, and we launched Natesto in the United States with our direct sales force in late summer 2016. Natesto is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone) in men and is the only testosterone replacement therapy, or TRT, delivered via a nasal gel. Natesto offers multiple advantages over currently available TRTs and competes in a $2.0 billion market. Importantly, as Natesto is delivered via the nasal mucosa and not the skin, there is no risk of testosterone transference to others, a known potential side effect and black box warning associated with all other topically applied TRTs, including the market leader AndroGel®.
 
Outside the U.S. we market MiOXSYS®, a novel in vitro diagnostic device that is currently CE marked (which generally enables it to be sold within the European Economic Area) and for which we intend to initiate a final clinical study to enable FDA clearance in the U.S. Our MiOXSYS system is a novel, point-of-care semen analysis system with the potential to become a standard of care in the diagnosis and management of male infertility. Male infertility is a prevalent and underserved condition and oxidative stress is widely implicated in its pathophysiology. MiOXSYS was developed from our core oxidation-reduction potential research platform known as RedoxSYS®. We are advancing MiOXSYS toward FDA clearance.
 
We currently market ProstaScint® (capromab pendetide), the only radioimaging agent indicated to detect the prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, in the assessment and staging of prostate cancer. ProstaScint is approved by the FDA for use in both newly diagnosed, high-risk prostate cancer patients and patients with recurrent prostate cancer.
 
On May 5, 2017, we acquired Nuelle, Inc, or Nuelle, a women’s sexual health company. This transaction expanded our product portfolio with the addition of the Fiera® personal care device for women. Fiera was recently launched in the U.S. and is a proprietary, revenue-generating product scientifically proven to enhance physical arousal and sexual desire in the millions of adult women around the world impacted by changes in sexual desire. This acquisition adds a novel, commercial-stage product in a complementary adjacency readily accessible by our U.S.-based commercial infrastructure. Nuelle was previously a portfolio company of leading venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.
 
In the future we will look to acquire additional urology products, including existing products we believe can offer distinct commercial advantages. Our management team’s prior experience has involved identifying clinical assets that can be re-launched to increase value, with a focused commercial infrastructure specializing in urology.
 
Natesto® (testosterone) nasal gel.
 
On April 22, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto (testosterone) nasal gel from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Acerus, which rights we acquired on July 1, 2016. Natesto is a patented, FDA-approved testosterone replacement therapy, or TRT, and is the only nasally-administered formulation of testosterone available in the United States. Natesto is a discreet, easy-to-administer nasal gel that may be appropriate for men with active lifestyles as Natesto is small, portable, Transportation Security Administration, or TSA-compliant, and easy to use. Importantly, Natesto is not applied directly to the patient’s skin as other topically applied TRTs are. Rather, it is delivered directly into the nasal mucosa via a proprietary nasal applicator. Thus, Natesto does not carry a black box warning related to testosterone transference to a man’s female partner or children — as other topically (primarily gels and solutions) administered TRTs do by virtue of their delivery directly onto the skin. We launched Natesto in the U.S. in late summer 2016 with our direct sales force, and we are positioning Natesto as the ideal treatment solution for men with active, busy lifestyles who suffer from hypogonadism.

MiOXSYS®.
 
MiOXSYS is a rapid in vitro diagnostic semen analysis test used in the quantitative measurement of static oxidation-reduction potential, or sORP, in human semen. MiOXSYS is a CE marked system and is an accurate, easy to use, and fast infertility assessment tool. It is estimated that 72.4 million couples worldwide experience infertility problems. In the United States, approximately 10% of couples are defined as infertile. Male infertility is responsible for between 40 – 50% of all infertility cases and affects approximately 7% of all men. Male infertility is often unexplained (idiopathic), and this idiopathic infertility is frequently associated with increased levels of oxidative stress in the semen. As such, having a rapid, easy-to-use diagnostic platform to measure oxidative stress should provide a practical way for male infertility specialists to improve semen analysis and infertility assessments without having to refer patients to outside clinical laboratories.
 
Male infertility is prevalent and underserved, and oxidative stress is widely implicated in its pathophysiology. The global male infertility market is expected to grow to over $300 million by 2020 with a CAGR of nearly 5% from 2014 to 2020. Oxidative stress is broadly implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic male infertility, yet very few diagnostic tools exist to effectively measure oxidative stress levels in men. However, antioxidants are widely available and recommended to infertile men. With the introduction of the MiOXSYS System, we believe for the first time there will be an easy and effective diagnostic tool to assess the degree of oxidative stress and potentially enable the monitoring of patients’ responses to antioxidant therapy as a treatment regimen for infertility. The MiOXSYS System received CE marking in Europe in January 2016 and obtained Health Canada Class II Medical Device approval in March 2016. We expect to advance MiOXSYS into clinical trials in the United States in order to enable 510k clearance.
 
ProstaScint® (capromab pendetide).
 
We became a commercial stage company by virtue of our acquisition of ProstaScint in May 2015 and are generating sales of this FDA-approved prostate cancer imaging agent. As prostate cancer is a condition commonly diagnosed and treated by urologists, ProstaScint complements our urology-focused product portfolio and pipeline. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 241,000 annual cases (as of 2012). Further, more than 2.2 million men were alive in 2006 with some history of prostate cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. The effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies. The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is expected to total $17.4 billion by 2017, a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 7.5% since 2012. At June 30, 2017, the ProstaScint asset was impaired based upon sales projections that we intend to only sell this product through mid-fiscal 2019, when this product expires.
 
Fiera® Personal Care Device
 
The Fiera Personal Care Device is the first hands-free wearable product for women, specifically designed to increase interest in, and physical readiness for sex, naturally. The product does so by creating a physically aroused state via the genitals. Co-created with healthcare professionals, Fiera is a small, discreet, fast-acting, and hands-free product that is designed to be used in advance of physical intimacy to help women feel ready and in the mood for sex. Fiera uses gentle suction coupled with stimulation to enhance blood flow to the genitals, increase lubrication, and ultimately get a woman ready for partnered intimacy in as little as 5 minutes.
 
With the acquisition of Nuelle, Inc., Aytu is expanding into the women’s sexual health and wellness market. Sexual wellness is inclusive of female sexual dysfunction which is a term that describes various sexual problems, such as low desire or interest, diminished arousal, orgasmic difficulties, and dyspareunia. Female sexual dysfunction is considered common, with an estimated prevalence of 43% from the U.S. National Health and Social Life Survey and similar estimates from other large, population-based surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom. In a study of over 31,000 women in the United States it was determined that 44% of women report a sexual problem. Specifically, the most common sexual problem is low desire, with a prevalence of 39%; followed by low arousal (26%) and orgasm difficulties (21%). Additionally, the incidence of sexual dysfunction is expected to increase through 2020 to effect more than 124 million women worldwide.
 
Fiera has been well studied and tested by health care professionals, and consumers and is scientifically proven to enhance arousal and interest in women of all ages, including pre and post-menopausal women. Recent consumer study results in women ages 25 – 75 showed that after 4 weeks of using Fiera:
 

· | 97% of women felt physically aroused; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 96% looked forward to being intimate with their partner; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 93% felt excited and ready for sex; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 89% of women felt more “in the mood”; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 87% felt as ready for sex as their partner did; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 86% of women felt a stronger emotional connection with their partner; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 85% reported their orgasm felt pleasurable and intense; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 85% thought about sex more often; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 85% engaged in sexual activity more often and felt satisfied in her relationship. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous studies also showed that 87% of women felt increased desire and 67% felt increased lubrication.
 
Key elements of our business strategy include:
 

· | Expand the commercialization of Natesto in the U.S. for the treatment of hypogonadism with our direct sales force. We launched Natesto in late summer 2016 and are targeting high prescribing TRT prescribers with a primary emphasis on urologists and male health practitioners. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand the commercialization in the U.S. of Fiera, through professional promotion using our existing sales force. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish MiOXSYS as a leading in vitro diagnostic device in the assessment of male infertility. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue the commercialization of FDA-approved ProstaScint for the staging of both newly diagnosed high-risk and recurrent prostate cancer patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire additional marketed products and late-stage development assets within our core urology focus that can be efficiently marketed through our growing commercial organization. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop a pipeline of urology products, with a focus on identifying novel products with sufficient clinical proof of concept that require modest internal R&D expense. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to augment our core in-development and commercial assets through efficient identification of complementary therapeutics, devices, and diagnostics related to urological disorders. We intend to seek assets that are near commercial stage or already generating revenues. Further, we intend to seek to acquire products through asset purchases, licensing, co-development, or collaborative commercial arrangements (co-promotions, co-marketing, etc.).
 
Our management team has extensive experience across a wide range of business development activities and have in-licensed or acquired products from large, mid-sized, and small enterprises in the United States and abroad. Through an assertive product and business development approach, we expect that we will build a substantial portfolio of complementary urology products.
 
Corporate History 
 
We were incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August 9, 2002 in the State of Colorado.
 
Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vyrix, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 18, 2013 and was wholly owned by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: AMPE), or Ampio, immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (defined below). Vyrix was previously a carve-out of the sexual dysfunction therapeutics business, including the late-stage men’s health product candidates, Zertane and Zertane-ED, from Ampio, that carve out was announced in December 2013. Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc., or Luoxis, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2013 and was majority owned by Ampio immediately prior to the completion of the Merger. Luoxis was initially focused on developing and advancing the RedoxSYS System. The MiOXSYS System was developed following the completed development of the RedoxSYS System.


On March 20, 2015, Rosewind formed Rosewind Merger Sub V, Inc. and Rosewind Merger Sub L, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of the Merger, and on April 16, 2015, Rosewind Merger Sub V, Inc. merged with and into Vyrix and Rosewind Merger Sub L, Inc. merged with and into Luoxis, and Vyrix and Luoxis became subsidiaries of Rosewind. Immediately thereafter, Vyrix and Luoxis merged with and into Rosewind with Rosewind as the surviving corporation (herein referred to as the Merger). Concurrent with the closing of the Merger, Rosewind abandoned its pre-merger business plans, and we now solely pursue the specialty healthcare market, focusing on urological related conditions, including the business of Vyrix and Luoxis. When we discuss our business in this Report, we include the pre-Merger business of Luoxis and Vyrix.
 
On June 8, 2015, we (i) reincorporated as a domestic Delaware corporation under Delaware General Corporate Law and changed our name from Rosewind Corporation to Aytu BioScience, Inc., and (ii) effected a reverse stock split in which each common stock holder received one share of common stock for each 12.174 shares outstanding. At our annual meeting of shareholders held on May 24, 2016, our shareholders approved (1) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 300.0 million to 100.0 million, which amendment was effective on June 1, 2016, and (2) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-12 which became effective on June 30, 2016. At our special meeting of shareholders held on July 26, 2017, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-20 which became effective on August 25, 2017. All share and per share amounts in this report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of these three reverse stock splits (hereafter referred to collectively as the “Reverse Stock Splits”).

Our Strategy 
 
We expect to create value by implementing a focused, three-pronged strategy. Our primary focus is on expanding Natesto in the U.S, growing our current, revenue-generating products, and building a complementary portfolio of aligned urology assets. In just over two years since our merger we have acquired or in-licensed three FDA-approved, marketed assets (and have since divested one asset – Primsol® Solution), launched a specialty urology sales force, advanced our lead diagnostic asset MiOXSYS to CE marking, engaged in asset purchase and licensing discussions for products aligned to our strategy, launched Natesto in the U.S. through our own sales force and acquired Nuelle Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary focused on the Fiera product.
 
We believe the strategy of focusing on commercializing assets prescribed by urologists is logical for several reasons. First, urology is a large yet concentrated specialty practice area that can be efficiently targeted. There are approximately 10,000 active urologists in the U.S., and we believe that this audience can be efficiently reached with a relatively small, focused sales force. Additionally, 90% of urologists practice in metropolitan areas where concentrated sales targeting can be achieved and “windshield” or sales representative driving time between targets can be minimized. Importantly, 81% of urologists practice in group practices, and over 60% are in practices of four or more physicians. Further, and important in building a balanced yet focused product portfolio, sub-specialization within large urology clinics is common whereby there is frequently individual clinical focus on specific areas within urology including prostate cancer and conditions, infertility, sexual wellness and vitality, urinary incontinence, hypogonadism, etc. This enables a company to offer multiple products to the various sub-specialties within these focused, concentrated customer targets.
 
Further, urologists treat a wide range of conditions and are thus appropriate targets across a broad range of clinical assets (Natesto – hypogonadism; ProstaScint – prostate cancer; MiOXSYS – male infertility; Fiera – female sexual wellness). Importantly, in urology, direct physician office purchasing of drugs, devices, and diagnostics is common. Along with this, a significant proportion of urology groups are privately-owned and often own and operate their own outpatient surgery centers and in-office laboratories. Further, large urology group practices have substantial payer influence and can have the ability to negotiate as large groups to achieve better reimbursement and coverage for favored treatments and procedures. Perhaps as important as these other factors, urologists are exposed to relatively limited promotional focus by “Big Pharma” and we believe can therefore be accessed and impacted more readily by an emerging company, such as Aytu, over time.
 
Aytu BioScience’s Strategic Value Drivers 
 


The primary elements of our strategy are:
 

• | Expanding the commercialization of Natesto , our revenue-generating, FDA-approved product in the United States via our direct commercial infrastructure. Launching Fiera in the United States via our direct sales force, and commercializing Fiera and MiOXSYS outside the United States via a developing distribution network. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Natesto is a novel, recently FDA-approved testosterone replacement therapy, or TRT, indicated for the treatment of hypogonadism in men. Natesto is the only nasal formulation of testosterone and is delivered via a proprietary nasal gel to enable simple, discreet application of testosterone into the nostrils. By virtue of applying Natesto to the nasal mucosa, and not to the man’s skin, there is no risk of transference to others. As such Natesto is the only TRT that does not have a black box warning associated with this potential for transference. Additionally, Natesto is a convenient form of testosterone that does not require application to large areas of the man’s body (arms, shoulders, upper torso, under arms) as required with market-leading products AndroGel and Axiron. A convenient form of TRT, applied two-to-three times a day in the nostrils, may be an appropriate option for men with hypogonadism who have active lifestyles, travel frequently, and value having a discreet way to treat their hypogonadism.

Low testosterone is a condition affecting approximately 13 million U.S. men, with U.S. revenues estimated at $2.4 billion in 2013. The market is expected to grow and we believe multiple factors are in place to position Natesto favorably in gaining market share in this large, growing market. By gaining less than a 5% share of the current U.S. market (assuming similar pricing and reimbursement), a novel TRT product could achieve annual revenues in excess of $100.0 million.
 
ProstaScint is the only imaging agent that specifically targets prostate cancer cells and demonstrates high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In multiple clinical studies researchers have shown that when SPECT/CT scans were used in patients pre-treated with ProstaScint, ProstaScint imaging was highly sensitive in detecting prostate cancer and significantly predictive of 10-year biochemical disease-free survival in prostate cancer patients (86.6% vs. 65.5%; p=0.0014). Additionally, the American Cancer Society specifically recognizes ProstaScint by name in current prostate cancer diagnosis guidelines. At June 30, 2017, the ProstaScint asset was impaired based upon sales projections that we intend to only sell this product through mid-fiscal 2019, when this product expires.


Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 241,000 annual cases (as of 2012). Further, more than 2.2 million men were alive in 2006 with some history of prostate cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. The effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies. The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is expected to total $17.4 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 7.5% since 2012.
 
The Fiera Personal Care Device is the first hands-free wearable product for women, specifically designed to increase interest in, and physical readiness for sex, naturally. Sexual wellness is inclusive of female sexual dysfunction which is a term that describes various sexual problems, such as low desire or interest, diminished arousal, orgasmic difficulties, and dyspareunia. Female sexual dysfunction is considered common, with an estimated prevalence of 43% from the U.S. National Health and Social Life Survey and similar estimates from other large, population-based surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom. In a study of over 31,000 women in the United States it was determined that 44% of women report a sexual problem. Specifically, the most common sexual problem is low desire, with a prevalence of 39%; followed by low arousal (26%) and orgasm difficulties (21%). Additionally, the incidence of sexual dysfunction is expected to increase through 2020 to effect more than 124 million women worldwide.
 
United States. We have launched a commercial infrastructure in the U.S. in order to support increased sales and distribution of Natesto, ProstaScint and Fiera in the U.S. We have a highly experienced sales force that is distinctly focused on impacting the prescribing of urologists, and through this efficient sales channel we are able to increase prescribing of our unique urology assets.
 
Ex-U.S. Fiera has not been previously marketed outside the U.S., therefore we believe we can realize commercial opportunities through efficient corporate partnerships in key markets around the world. With MiOXSYS now CE Marked we have started developing a distribution network to launch this first-in-class in vitro diagnostic device.
 

• | Developing a pipeline of novel urological therapeutics through assertive acquisition, licensing, or co-promotion, inclusive of both marketed and late-stage development assets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to diversify our product portfolio and create more value, we intend to seek to acquire complementary products or product candidates to develop and/or commercialize, including marketed assets. Initially, the focus will be on acquiring products or product candidates for urological conditions but we will opportunistically consider other products or product candidates based on their ability to create value and complement our focus. We plan to pursue product acquisitions, inclusive of therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices, which we will evaluate for their strategic fit and potential for near-term and/or accretive value to us. In a little over two years from the Company’s merger in April 2015 we began generating revenue from the acquisition of ProstaScint (which we have since divested), and we later launched Natesto in July 2016 and Fiera in May 2017. We expect to continue to identify and acquire additional, complementary urology assets in the future.
 

• | Completing U.S. studies in male infertility with the MiOXSYS System to enable 510k clearance by FDA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With MiOXSYS now CE marked and available for sale in many markets outside the U.S., we are positioned to initiate our clinical studies in the U.S. to enable 510k clearance. We expect to receive guidance from FDA on clinical study design and patient criteria and implement the required clinical program as soon as possible. If cleared in the U.S., MiOXSYS would be the first and only semen analysis diagnostic test cleared by the FDA for the detection of oxidative stress in infertility.

Male infertility is prevalent and underserved, and oxidative stress is widely implicated in its pathophysiology. As such, we have bolstered our research focus in this area with the MiOXSYS System to complement our focus on urologic conditions. The ex-US global male infertility market is estimated at over $800 million in diagnostics, therapeutics, and procedure costs. Oxidative stress is broadly implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic male infertility, yet very few diagnostic tools exist to effectively measure oxidative stress levels in men. However, antioxidants are widely available and recommended to infertile men. With the introduction of the MiOXSYS System, we believe for the first time there will be an easy and effective diagnostic tool to assess degree of oxidative stress and monitor patients’ responses to antioxidant therapy and improve diagnosis of male infertility.
 
Through our extensive network of researchers developed at one of our predecessor companies Luoxis, the RedoxSYS System has demonstrated the potential to have broad clinical applications inclusive of male infertility in semen analysis studies. Studies have been completed at the Cleveland Clinic, a major U.S. university and Hamad Medical Corporation, major hospital in Doha, Qatar in the evaluation of male infertility. As such, we developed the MiOXSYS System as a line extension to RedoxSYS to specifically assess oxidative stress in semen as a tool to assess male infertility. In January 2016, the MiOXSYS System received CE Marking and is now available for sale in multiple ex-U.S. markets including Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. In March 2016, the MiOXSYS System obtained Health Canada Class II Medical Device approval. With Health Canada approval in place, the Company has begun initial marketing of the product in Canada.
 
Our FDA – Approved Urology Products 
 
Two of our products have received FDA approval for marketing in the U.S.: Natesto and ProstaScint.
 
Natesto for Testosterone Replacement 
 
On April 22, 2016, we entered into and closed a license and supply agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Natesto® (testosterone) nasal gel from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Acerus, which rights we acquired effective on July 1, 2016. Natesto is a patented, FDA-approved testosterone replacement therapy, or TRT, and is the only nasally-administered formulation of testosterone available in the United States. Natesto is a discreet, easy-to-administer nasal gel that may be appropriate for men with active lifestyles as Natesto is small, portable, TSA-compliant, and easy to use.
 
Importantly, Natesto is not applied directly to the patient’s skin as other topically applied TRTs are. Rather, it is delivered directly into the nasal mucosa via a patented nasal applicator. Thus, Natesto does not carry a black box warning related to testosterone transference to a man’s female partner or children — as other topically (primarily gels) administered TRTs do by virtue of their delivery directly onto the skin.
 


Image of Natesto (testosterone) nasal gel 
 
The unique delivery of Natesto also enables simple, discreet use by a single application into each nostril two to three times daily and may improve compliance over topical forms that are applied to large sections of the arms, shoulders, and other large areas of the man’s upper torso. It also offers a more discreet method of TRT administration compared to films/patches (Androderm & Testoderm, which is applied to the scrotum) and doesn’t involve the pain, potential for site injection infections, and the administration inconvenience of the implantable and/or injectable TRTs such as Testopel and Aveed.
 
A concern associated with the use of the currently marketed testosterone gels is the unintentional transfer of testosterone to women (or children) by skin contact with the man’s application site. In the event of a female partner receiving inadvertent testosterone exposure due to intimate contact with her male partner, she may develop hyperandrogenism, a condition characterized by excess levels of androgens. This condition may result in women developing acne, scalp hair loss, excessive facial or body hair, breast atrophy, and other symptoms. Natesto, as it is nasally administered, does not present this potential complication of ‘transference’ and thus does not have a black box warning as is associated with the topically applied testosterone supplements.

Natesto is an androgen indicated for replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone including:
 

• | Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): testicular failure due to conditions such as cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter’s syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) above the normal range. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low serum testosterone concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range. 

The U.S. Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) Market
 
We believe we have an opportunity to increase revenue with Natesto in the U.S. Natesto competes in a large, growing market. The U.S. TRT market is large, with annual revenues in the U.S. in 2013 of $2.4 billion. At the current market size of over $2.0 billion, a product with 5% market penetration could achieve sales in excess of $100 million annually, assuming comparatively similar product pricing and reimbursement levels as seen with other TRTs.
 
The U.S. prescription testosterone market is comprised primarily of topically applied treatments in the form of gels, solutions, and patches. Testopel® and Aveed®, injectable products typically implanted directly under the skin by a physician, are also FDA-approved.
 
The actively marketed, FDA-approved TRTs include:
 

Brand Name | Form of Delivery | Company | Year Approved | Black Box Warning 
-----------+-------------------------+----------------------+-------------------+----------------------
Androderm® | Film/Patch | Actavis | 1995 | No 
AndroGel® | Gel | AbbVie | 2000 | Yes 
Aveed® | Injection | Endo Pharmaceuticals | 2014 | No 
Axiron® | Solution | Eli Lilly & Company | 2010 | Yes 
Fortesta® | Gel | Endo Pharmaceuticals | 2010 | Yes 
Striant® | Extended Release Tablet | Endo Pharmaceuticals | 2003 | No 
Testim® | Gel | Endo Pharmaceuticals | 2002 | Yes 
Testoderm® | Film/Patch | Johnson & Johnson | 1993 | No 
Testopel® | Injection | Endo Pharmaceuticals | 1972 | No 
Vogelxo® | Gel | Upsher-Smith | 2014 | Yes 

 
AndroGel®, marketed by AbbVie, is the leading TRT and had 2012 revenues of $1.15 billion. AndroGel had over half of the total TRT market across its 1.0% and 1.62% formulations of the product.
 
Importantly, however, AndroGel is now facing generic threats with the expiration of key patents for its 1.0% formulation, and is beginning to see generic equivalents to its 1.62% formulation be introduced. Other products with significant shares of the TRT market include Axiron, Testim, Fortesta, Androderm, and Testopel.

About Hypogonadism
 
Male hypogonadism is a condition in which the body does not produce enough testosterone — the hormone that plays a key role in masculine growth and development during puberty — or has an impaired ability to produce sperm or both. Men can be born with male hypogonadism, or it can develop later in life from injury or infection.
 
Hypogonadism is formally defined as deficient or absent male gonadal function that results in insufficient testosterone secretion. Hypogonadism may be caused primarily by testicular failure, or secondarily by hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, resulting in the production or release of insufficient testosterone to maintain testosterone-dependent functions and systems. It can also result from a combination of testicular failure and hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction.
 
Hypogonadism affects an estimated 13 million men in the United States, and although it may occur in men at any age, low testosterone levels are especially common in older males. More than 60% of men over age 65 have free testosterone levels below the normal values of men aged 30 to 35. Studies suggest that hypogonadism in adult men is often underdiagnosed and under treated.
 
Low testosterone, as male hypogonadism is also known, is associated with a number of signs and symptoms, most notably loss of libido and erectile dysfunction (ED). Other signs of low testosterone include depressive symptoms, a decrease in cognitive abilities, irritability and lethargy or loss of energy. Deficient endogenous testosterone also has negative effects on bone mass and is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis in men. Progressive decrease in muscle mass and muscle strength and testicular dysfunction, often resulting in impaired sperm production, are also associated with low testosterone levels.
 
A younger patient may have pure hypogonadism as a primary event, whereas an older man may have an age-related decline in testosterone production that is a part of his ED profile. However, because both ED and loss of libido are hallmarks of hypogonadism, for a patient who presents with ED it is recommended that he have a basic hormone profile to determine if he has low testosterone. Treatments to normalize testosterone can not only improve libido, energy level and the potential to have normal erections, but can also improve the response to sildenafil, if that is deemed appropriate treatment.
 
Natesto Clinical Studies Demonstrating Safety and Efficacy 
 
Natesto has been shown to be safe and effective in men with hypogonadism. It was approved by the FDA in May 2014.
 
In its pivotal clinical trial, Natesto was evaluated for efficacy in a 90-day, open-label, multicenter study of 306 hypogonadal men. Eligible patients were 18 years of age and older (mean age 54 years) and had morning serum total testosterone concentrations less than 300 ng/dL. Patients were Caucasian (89%), African-American (6%), Asian (5%), or of other ethnicities (less than 1%).
 
Patients were instructed to self-administer Natesto (11 mg of testosterone) intranasally either two or three times daily.
 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with an average serum total testosterone concentration (Cavg) within the normal range (300 to 1050 ng/dL) on Day 90.
 
The secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a maximum total testosterone concentration (Cmax) above three predetermined limits: greater than 1500 ng/dL, between 1800 and 2500 ng/dL, and greater than 2500 ng/dL.
 
A total of 78 hypogonadal men received Natesto (11 mg of testosterone) three times daily (33 mg of testosterone daily). Of these, a total of 73 hypogonadal men were included in the statistical evaluation of efficacy (total testosterone pharmacokinetics) on Day 90 based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with last observation carried forward (LOCF). Ninety percent of these 73 patients had a Cavg within the normal range (300 to 1050 ng/dL) on Day 90. The percentages of patients with Cavg below the normal range (less than 300 ng/dL) and above the normal range (greater than 1050 ng/dL) on Day 90 were 10% and 0%, respectively.
 
The table below (Table 3 from the Natesto Prescribing Information) summarizes the mean (SD) serum total testosterone concentrations on Day 90 in 69 patients who had a full pharmacokinetic sampling profile and were treated with Natesto (11 mg of testosterone) three times daily for 90 days.
 
Table 3: Mean (SD) Serum Total Testosterone Concentration on Day 90 Following  Administration of Natesto (11 mg of testosterone) Three Times Daily 


Natesto (11 mg of testosterone) Three Times Daily (N=69) 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cavg(ng/dL) | 421 (116) 
Cmax(ng/dL) | 1044 (378) 
Cmin(ng/dL) | 215 (74) 



In the same clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of Natesto, which was conducted at 39 U.S. outpatient sites, it was shown that 70% of the per protocol patients in the twice-daily ‘titration arm’ (n=141) achieved normal testosterone levels. Ninety-one percent of the per protocol patients in the thrice-daily group (n=77) achieved normal testosterone levels, demonstrating that the majority of men in both treatment groups achieved normalization of testosterone levels while taking Natesto. The efficacy of both B.I.D. (twice daily) and T.I.D. (three times daily) dosing of Natesto is demonstrated in the graphs below:

Newly Presented Natesto Safety and Efficacy Data
 
Secondary endpoints that were measured in the above-referenced pivotal trial included the impact on Natesto – over 90 days – on erectile function as well as on mood. The 90-day clinical trial demonstrated that – within 30 days of initiating treatment with Natesto – subjects exhibited a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in all five domains of erectile function. Specifically, at the end of the 90-day treatment period, improvement from baseline for each domain were as follows:

· | 36% improvement in erectile function 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 42% improvement in intercourse satisfaction 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 35% improvement in orgasmic function 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 31% improvement in sexual desire 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 38% improvement in overall satisfaction 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

 



In addition to demonstrating a significant improvement in erectile function, Natesto also exhibits a substantial impact on mood as measured by Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). As early as 30 days – and continuing up to day 90 – Natesto demonstrates a substantial increase in Positive Affect and a substantial decrease in Negative Affect.




In addition to efficacy parameters, safety parameters have also been examined and recently reported. Natesto restores serum testosterone to normal levels while Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) remained well within the reference range over 90 days. Also, hematocrit (increased blood thickness) was not significantly impacted by Natesto over 360 days of treatment. Other testosterone products alter levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteining Hormone (LH) and increase hematocrit.

Natesto Product Features and Patient Benefits
 
We believe Natesto has a unique opportunity to gain market share in the more than $2.4 billion U.S. market given the product’s novel features and patient benefits including:

· | Ease of administration; Appropriate for men with busy, active lives; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Established efficacy in pivotal FDA trials with a unique, low dose of testosterone; Effective in improving serum testosterone levels while using a proven, lower dose of testosterone; significant symptom improvement, notably: 


· | Natesto caused statistically significant improvements in each of the 5 domains of erectile function (P < 0.0001); The majority of the effect on erectile dysfunction was evident by Day 30 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Substantial Increase in Positive Affect and Substantial Decrease in Negative Affect (PANAS) as Early as Day 30 (P < 0.0001) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Discreet product presentation and ease of transport (TSA compliant); Important for men who travel frequently and desire a simple, portable solution that travels easily with them; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No risk of secondary exposure to testosterone due to dermal transference, an important consideration when thinking about a hypogonadal man’s partner’s or child’s safety; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Safety, with a lower incidence of rising PSA levels than the market leading product AndroGel; Natesto demonstrates a 5.5% rate of rising PSA levels in clinical trials, while AndroGel demonstrated a rising PSA rate of over 11% in clinical trials. This is an important consideration as physicians concerned with understanding and tracking prostate cancer risk frequently monitor PSA levels in men over 50 years of age. Additionally, Natesto restored serum testosterone to normal levels while Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) remained well within the reference range over 90 days. Also, hematocrit (increased blood thickness) was not significantly impacted by Natesto over 360 days of treatment.

Natesto has proven efficacy and a product profile well suited for men suffering from hypogonadism who have active, busy lifestyles who want a simple, discreet TRT option. We believe Natesto can play an important role in the treatment of hypogonadism, a condition affecting approximately 13 million U.S. men.
 
Natesto Market Opportunity
 
Two recent developments have presented a unique opportunity for Natesto that we believe will enable us to effectively compete and be well positioned in the more than $2.0 billion TRT market. As previously indicated, AndroGel’s patent expired in 2015 and we expect a generic entrant to begin eroding AbbVie’s market share. As a result, we expect there to be diminished promotional support in the form of fewer physician details and lower overall promotional spending by AbbVie. In conjunction with the market leader’s diminished intellectual property position and potential diminished promotional spending, the TRT market has received increased scrutiny from the FDA.
 
On January 31, 2014 and subsequently on March 3, 2015, the FDA issued Safety Announcements relating to the possible increased risk of non-fatal heart attacks and strokes in patients taking testosterone. While the FDA has not concluded that the FDA-approved testosterone treatment increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, or death, this recent safety consideration has caused patient advocates and consumer groups to ask for increased scrutiny on the direct to consumer advertising associated with the leading testosterone replacement products, most notably AndroGel and Axiron. As a result, we expect decreased advertising spending in the TRT category to enable newer, less established products like Natesto to more effectively infiltrate the market through on-label, physician-directed promotion with a direct selling effort. While the potential safety concerns may cause a decrease in physician prescribing, we expect that physicians will continue to prescribe TRTs for patients for whom TRT treatment is appropriate.
 
Leading urology groups including the American Urological Association, or AUA, have strongly commented in favor of continued prescribing of TRTs for appropriate patients, and the safety data precipitating the FDA’s comments have been called into question. Importantly, the FDA has not called for discontinuation of TRTs. Rather, patients were encouraged to speak with their health care professional and not stop taking TRTs.
 
In the FDA’s initial statement about the potential cardiovascular risks associated with TRT treatment, the agency commented:
 
“Patients should not stop taking their prescribed testosterone products without first discussing their questions or concerns with their health care professionals. ... The prescribing information in the drug labels of FDA-approved testosterone products should be followed.”
 
Importantly, following the FDA’s statement, the AUA issued a strong response reiterating the clinical importance of low testosterone and maintaining their support for the appropriate use of testosterone replacement therapy:
 
“Men with hypogonadism may also experience reduced muscle mass and strength and increased body fat. Hypogonadism may also contribute to reduced bone mineral density and anemia. Testosterone therapy is appropriate treatment for patients with clinically significant hypogonadism, including those with idiopathic clinical hypogonadism that may or may not be age-related, after full discussion of potential adverse effects.”
 
Additional publications publicly refuted the validity of the data that precipitated the FDA’s safety concern in a subsequent statement following the 2014 annual meeting of the AUA:

“During the last several months there has been a firestorm of negative media attention regarding testosterone deficiency and its treatment, precipitated by a study reporting an increased rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) associated with testosterone prescriptions. This public judgment of T therapy demands a response. As researchers and clinicians with extensive experience with T deficiency and its treatment, we disagree that the recent study published in PLOS (Public Library of Science) One presents any credible evidence that T prescriptions increase health risks, and we find baseless the general assertion that testosterone is prescribed to men “who are simply reluctant to accept the fact that they are getting older.” We object to comments questioning whether T deficiency is real, regardless of whether it is called hypogonadism or “low T” as used in advertisements.” (Note: The PLOS is an open access online publication venue, and while peer reviewed it is not a published medical journal.)
 
AbbVie’s sales of AndroGel dropped 5% in the first half of 2014, following the FDA’s initial Safety Announcement and the subsequent reaction of the AUA and others. In the face of significant new competitive entrants (Aveed, Vogelxo) at that time and the FDA’s expressed safety concerns, this represents a relatively insignificant sales decline. We believe this decline speaks to a real, present need in hypogonadism and a substantial opportunity for newly marketed products like Natesto. Natesto has proven safety, a recent FDA approval that speaks to the product’s efficacy, and unique product features and patient benefits we believe will set Natesto apart from the topically administered competitive products in the more than $2.4 billion U.S. TRT market.
 
MiOXSYS In Vitro Diagnostic System for Male Infertility 
 
Male infertility is a significant medical condition that urologists and infertility specialists treat frequently in the office setting or specialized fertility centers around the world. Of all sexually active couples, 8% to 12% are infertile and male infertility is the sole cause or contributing factor up to 50% of the time. The global male infertility market is large and growing. The market for male infertility diagnosis and treatments is expected to grow to more than $300 million globally by 2020, with a CAGR of nearly 5% from 2014 to 2020. Despite the prevalence of male infertility, difficulties remain in effectively diagnosing root causes. Oxidative stress assessment is considered a standard practice in complex andrology laboratories around the world, but due to various factors oxidative stress testing is not routinely employed in clinicians’ offices or standard laboratory settings.
 
Seminal oxidative stress has been well established throughout the peer-reviewed literature to play a substantial role in unexplained male infertility, and researchers and clinicians actively consider oxidative stress when conducting laboratory infertility assessment. While oxidative stress is well established as a leading contributing factor to male infertility, a significant proportion of male infertility remains unexplained in part because of the lack of standardized tests available to clinicians and researchers to assess oxidative stress in semen and plasma. This lack of standardization has resulted in poor implementation of semen and plasma analysis around the world. Further, current testing platforms are cost-prohibitive for small office settings or local medical laboratories and require extensive training and on-site expertise. Additionally, antioxidant supplementation is frequently recommended to patients by clinicians without an effective method of measuring treatment success. As such, we believe introducing the MiOXSYS System to assess oxidative stress levels in semen and seminal fluid represents a significant commercial opportunity and novel way for clinicians to assess male factor infertility and assess therapeutic responses of patients in a simple, reliable, and cost-effective way.
 
The MiOXSYS System was CE marked in January 2016, and we have started early commercialization efforts outside the U.S.
 
An attractive aspect of the reproductive health market relates to reimbursement as infertility treatments and the associated diagnostic tests are generally paid directly by patients. The current infertility treatments could cost in excess of $10,000 per treatment cycle, so the addition of a moderately priced oxidative stress test would consume nominal relative costs while providing specific, actionable information needed to improve the oxidative status of infertile patients. The current infertility treatments include antioxidant supplements and lifestyle modifications that lower oxidative stress (e.g., smoking cessation, exercise, dietary changes, etc.), so the measurements reported by the MiOXSYS System could effectively guide treatment in the infertile patients.
 
The global male infertility market is expected to grow to more than $300 million by 2020. With a substantial base of conditions for which the MiOXSYS System may present utility, we believe there is significant revenue potential from this first-in-class system.
 
As part of our strategy to develop future clinical applications of the RedoxSYS System (the MiOXSYS System’s predecessor product for plasma and whole blood detection), we have conducted initial studies in male reproductive health. Male infertility is a significant medical condition in which oxidative stress is well known to play a substantial role. As such, we believe developing a clinical application to assess oxidative stress levels with the uniquely designed and programmed MiOXSYS System for semen analysis represents a significant commercial opportunity. Oxidative stress is well established as a leading contributing factor to male infertility. Further, a significant proportion of male infertility remains unexplained in part because of the lack of standardized tests available to clinicians and researchers to assess oxidative stress in semen and seminal plasma. This lack of standardization has resulted in poor implementation of semen and plasma analysis around the world. Further, currently available tests are cumbersome, time consuming to perform, and costly.

We conducted initial proof-of-concept clinical studies in male infertility with a leading research center in the United States, which demonstrated that oxidation-reduction potential effectively measures oxidative stress levels in semen and seminal plasma — and that these levels strongly correlate with established markers of infertility. Semen analysis studies are routinely conducted to assess causes of infertility, so we expect clinicians and oxidative stress researchers to readily integrate the MiOXSYS System into routine use upon the completion of more extensive studies and regulatory clearance for this use. Additional studies are now in the late planning stages that will evaluate the MiOXSYS System’s performance in the detection of oxidative stress levels and correlations with key semen parameters in both healthy and infertile males. The MiOXSYS System must receive 510k clearance from the FDA before we can market it for clinical use in the United States. Of the $300 million male infertility market projected for 2020, the North American, Middle Eastern, and Asia Pacific markets dominate due to prevalence, awareness of treatment, and availability of treatment resources. Thus, it is important that we have already established distribution relationships and direct access to major oxidative stress researchers in many of these important markets.
 
Following our initial proof of concept studies with a leading center in the United States with the MiOXSYS system, we conducted our CE mark-enabling study with over 300 infertile patients. The two key studies conducted with these leading centers are presented below.
 
United States-Based Proof-of-Concept Clinical Study 
 
Fifty-one (51) male patients were seen in a national clinic for suspected infertility. In addition to standard semen analyses (WHO 5th Edition, 2010), samples were measured for oxidative stress using the MiOXSYS System. Raw sORP values were normed to sperm concentration (mv/106 sperm/mL) and compared across six semen parameters that are associated with fertility: ejaculate volume, concentration, total sperm number, total motility, progressive motility, and normal morphology. Higher sORP values are associated with a higher state of oxidative stress.
 
Patients with abnormally low ejaculate volume had similar sORP values as those with a normal volume. Those with an abnormally low sperm concentration or overall total number, have significantly higher sORP values than those in the normal range. Abnormally few motile sperm or few sperm with a progressive motility were also associated with significantly higher sORP values than those in the normal range. Lastly, semen samples that had fewer normal sperm had slightly, but not significantly, higher sORP values. Thus, most abnormal semen parameters appear to be associated with higher measures of oxidative stress.
 
When samples that achieve all six parameters of associated with fertile semen are compared to samples that fail one or more of the parameters, the samples that meet the parameters have significantly lower sORP values than those that fail one or more. A cutoff value of 1.635 mv/106 sperm/mL separated those that met fertility standards from those that did not. In the current study, 85.7% of samples that met standards fell below this cutoff value, whereas 71.8% of those that failed one or more parameters had sORP values above this cutoff. The probability that a semen sample with a measured sORP value higher than the cutoff is abnormal in at least one of the semen parameters, is 96.5%. Lastly, the more parameters that a semen sample falls within the abnormal range, the higher the sORP values, thus those that are abnormal on five or six parameters have higher sORP values than those that are abnormal on one or two.
 
Data derived from patients of the national clinic confirms the results obtained in an international fertility clinic. Overall, semen that falls into the abnormal range for concentration, total number, motility, and morphology have higher levels of oxidative stress as indicated by higher sORP values. These values are uniquely obtained using the MiOXSYS System for semen analysis.
 
In April 2016, we observed encouraging data from two prospective studies of the MiOXSYS System that demonstrated its clinical utility as a tool for measuring ORP to assess the degree of oxidative stress levels in human semen.
 
The first study measured sORP in the semen samples of infertile men that correlated well with the sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. The second study further suggests that sORP is an easy to determine one-step indicator of increased oxidative stress in semen samples of infertile men especially with leukocytospermia. The results are currently being validated in a larger cohort of infertile men.
 
International Pivotal Clinical Study 
 
Three-hundred sixty-six (366) male partners from couples seeking fertility advisement in an international clinic were recruited. In addition to standard semen analyses (WHO 5th Edition, 2010), samples were measured for oxidative stress using the MiOXSYS System. Raw sORP values were normed to sperm concentration (mv/106 sperm/mL) and compared across six semen parameters that are associated with fertility: ejaculate volume, concentration, total sperm number, total motility, progressive motility, and normal morphology. Higher sORP values are associated with a higher state of oxidative stress.

Patients with abnormally low ejaculate volume had similar sORP values as those with a normal volume. Those with an abnormally low sperm concentration or overall total number, have significantly higher sORP values than those in the normal range. Abnormally few motile sperm or few sperm with a progressive motility were also associated with significantly higher sORP values than those in the normal range. Lastly, semen samples that had fewer normal sperm had significantly higher sORP values than those that fell into the range of normal morphology. Thus, most abnormal semen parameters appear to be associated with higher measures of oxidative stress.
 
When samples that achieve all six parameters associated with fertile semen are compared to samples that fail one or more of the parameters, the samples that meet the parameters have significantly lower sORP values than those that fail one or more. A cutoff value of 1.635 mv/106 sperm/mL separated those that met fertility standards from those that did not. In the current study, 91.43% of samples that met fertility standards fell below this cutoff value whereas 59.5% of those that failed one or more had sORP values above this cutoff. The probability that a semen sample with a measured sORP value higher than the cutoff is abnormal in at least one of the semen parameters, is 98.6%. Lastly, the more parameters that a semen samples falls within the abnormal range, the higher the sORP values, thus those that are abnormal on five or six parameters have higher sORP values than those that are abnormal on one or two.
 
Data derived from patients at this international clinic confirms the results obtained in United States fertility clinic. Overall, semen that falls into the abnormal range for concentration, total number, motility, and morphology have higher levels of oxidative stress as indicated by higher sORP values. These values are obtained uniquely using the MiOXSYS System for semen analysis.
 
Proof of concept clinical studies have been conducted at the Cleveland Clinic’s Department of Urology, and two posters were presented at the 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine in November 2015. These abstracts are presented below.

Department of Urology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH
 
Abstract: 
 
Objective: Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) is a novel measure of oxidative stress or redox imbalance in biological samples. Static ORP (sORP) provides an integrated measure of the balance between total oxidants and reductants in a biological system, whereas capacity ORP (cORP) equates to the amount of antioxidant reserves. sORP has been shown to correlate well with illness and injury severity that accompanies the state of oxidative stress; cORP correlates with the ability to respond to illness or injury. Our objectives were to evaluate whether 1) ORP can be measured in semen and seminal plasma samples and 2) ORP levels correlate with sperm motility.
 
Design: Prospective study measuring ORP in both semen and seminal plasma.
 
Materials and Methods: Semen samples (n=18) from normal control subjects were divided into two fractions and the seminal plasma was isolated from one fraction (300 x g, 7min). Sperm count and motility were assessed manually. sORP (mV/106 sperm) and cORP (μC/106 sperm) were measured in both fractions (RedoxSYS®, Aytu BioScience). Values are reported as Mean ± SEM. Spearman correlation and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) were used for statistical analysis.
 
Results: sORP and cORP levels in semen correlated significantly with the levels in seminal plasma. A significant negative correlation existed between sperm motility and sORP in both semen (r=-0.609; p=0.004) and seminal plasma (r=-0.690; p=0.002). Furthermore, a sORP cutoff of 4.73mV/106 sperm in semen (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 89.5%, AUC=0.947) and 4.65mV/106 sperm in seminal plasma (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 93.8%, AUC = 0.969) was highly predictive of abnormal sperm motility.
 
Conclusions: RedoxSYS® accurately measured sORP and cORP in both semen and seminal plasma samples. Based on high sensitivity as assessed by ROC analysis, sORP levels can be used to screen infertile men with oxidative stress. These results are being validated in a larger cohort of infertile men.

Effect of Time on Oxidation-Reduction Potential in Semen and Seminal Plasma 
 
R. Sharma,1 S. S. Du Plessis,1,2 A. Agarwal,1 A. Harlev,1,3 L. Samanta,1,4 G. Ahmad,1,5 S. Gupta,1 E. S. Sabanegh6; 1. Center For Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 2.

Redox Biology Laboratory, School of Life Science, Ravenshaw University, Orissa, India, 5. Physiology and Cell Biology, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, 6. Department of Urology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH
 
Abstract: 
 
Objective: Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) is a novel measure of oxidative stress or redox imbalance in biological fluids. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive and have a very short half-life. ROS levels in the seminal ejaculate should be measured within an hour after collection to prevent a reduction in ROS levels over time. The traditional methods of measuring seminal ROS are time sensitive and time consuming, making it difficult to use them for diagnostic purposes. It would be highly advantageous to employ a method that is independent of semen age and provides results in real time. The objective was to assess the effect of time on static ORP (sORP), which provides a snapshot of current redox balance, and capacity ORP (cORP) which is indicative of the amount of antioxidant reserves available.
 
Design: Prospective study measuring ORP in semen and seminal plasma samples at time 0 and 120 minutes. Materials and Methods: The sORP and cORP of both semen (n=18) and seminal plasma (n=15) samples from normal control subjects were measured after liquefaction (time 0) and after 120 minutes of incubation at room temperature (RedoxSYS®, Aytu BioScience). Values are mean ± SEM. Spearman correlation was used for statistical analysis.
 
Results: A significant correlation was seen between sORP at time 0 and 120 minutes in semen and seminal plasma. Similar correlations were found for cORP values at both time intervals.
 
Conclusions: ORP values are not affected by the age of semen or seminal plasma for up to 120 minutes, making it easier to employ this new technology for diagnostic use.
 
Recently additional studies have further demonstrated the clinical utility of the MiOXSYS System in Male Infertility.

Abstract:
 
Objective: To determine if Sperm DNA fragmentation is really correlated to seminal oxidative stress.

Design: Prospective study performed on 312 patients attending the male infertility clinic at a tertiary medical center between February and August, 2016. Patients receiving medical or surgical treatment for infertility prior to their presentation or who had a sperm concentration less than 5 million/ml sperm were excluded. Patients were subjected to history taking, clinical examination as well as semen analysis and SDF assessment using Halosperm kit (cut off value <30%) and static oxidation reduction potential (sORP) using MiOXSYS system. Patients were divided according to SDF result (normal/ high) and to age (<40 years / > 40 years).
 
Results: A total number of 312 patients were included in the study. Patients with high SDF had significantly higher age than those with normal SDF. The mean total and progressive motility was significantly higher in the normal SDF group while sORP was significantly lower in the normal SDF group compared with the high SDF group. Presence of varicocele did not significantly affect SDF level (Table 1). SDF was negatively correlated with total (-0.526, p<0.001) and progressive motility (-0.415, p<0.001) and positively correlated with abnormal morphology, sORP and age (0.351, 0.222 and 0.192, respectively, p<0.001 for all). SDF was significantly lower while total motility was significantly higher in patients <40 years compared with patients >40 years of age.
 
Conclusions: Sperm DNA fragmentation is positively correlated with seminal oxidative stress measured by Seminal oxidation reduction potential. Sperm DNA fragmentation and seminal oxidation reduction potential should be included in assessment of male infertility. Using ORP testing can help in detecting the target patients for antioxidant therapy.

Abstract:
 
Objective: To determine whether ORP in semen of men undergoing ART affects embryo quality during IVF and plays any role in predictive value for clinical pregnancy.

Design: Prospective study was carried out in the VKF American Hospital, Assisted Reproduction Unit, Istanbul, Turkey. The study was approved by Koc University the institutional review board and patients signed a consent prior to participation. The 154 male patients who were visiting Andrology laboratory (between May 31, 2016 and Jan 1, 2017) were grouped in according to semen ORP values. IVF was performed using the semen samples by our routine established protocol. Exclusion criteria included azoospermia, presence of STD or chronic disease, use of any prescription drug or OTC medications or antioxidants. Semen samples were collected and assessed for routine parameters using the WHO-2010 guidelines. sORP was measured (mV) using the MiOXSYS system and normalized to concentration (mV/10 sperm/mL). Embryo was graded based on the quality (Grade 1 for best quality and Grade 5 is poor).
 
Results: All semen samples were grouped as 'High ORP” and 'Low ORP” based upon seminal ORP cut-off value of 1.36 mV/10 sperm. Mean Grade 1 embryo quality in High ORP group (n=81) and low ORP group (n=26) was 2.88 ± 1.76 and 1.33 ± 0.47 respectively. In addition, Mean Grade 2 embryo in High ORP group was 2.47 ± 1.54 and in low group was 4 ± 1.63 accordingly. Clinical pregnancy rate (Mean 0.48; 19/40) was significantly higher (p=0.006) in low ORP group compared to high ORP group (1/8) however there was no significant difference in embryo quality in both high and low ORP groups (Grade I embryo p=0.67, Grade II G2 embryo p=0.33). Also, mean mother age in two groups was not significantly different (low ORP = 37.2 years and high ORP=35.2 years; p=0.23). These data suggest that ORP may play an important role in determining the success of clinical pregnancy irrespective of oocyte quality in women >35 yrs. of age.
 
Conclusions: Semen ORP measurement can be used as an indicator of oxidative stress and help determine the successful embryo development during IVF. These findings may have important diagnostic and prognostic implications for couples experiencing male infertility and undergoing assisted reproductive technique (ART). Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanism of increased ORP in a subset of couples (male factor, no female factor) undergoing ART to corroborate the significance of these findings.

Abstract:
 
Objective: To determine if seminal oxidation reduction potential (ORP) increases in infertile men with clinical varicocele.
 
Design: A prospective controlled pilot study was conducted on 36 men seeking medical advice for an infertility problem between October, 2016 and January, 2017. Following clinical examination, and scrotal color Doppler ultrasound, infertile men were divided into two groups. Group1: infertile men with clinical varicocele; and group 2: infertile men with idiopathic infertility (no detectable abnormality in their genital examination). Patients were examined in an infertility center by the same Andrologist. Semen analysis was performed according to the WHO manual (2010). Seminal ORP was measured using the MiOXSYS system (Aytu BioScience, Inc., Englewood, CO, USA). Absolute values of ORP, in millivolts (mV), were normalized for sperm concentrations and results were expressed as mV/10 sperm/mL. Quantitative measures were presented as median and inter-quartile range (25 and 75 centiles). P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
 
Results: The study included 17 patients in group 1 and 19 in group 2. Patient's age and duration of infertility in group 1 [ 32 (30, 34) years] & [4 (1.5, 5) years] were not significantly different from group 2 [33 (30, 36.5) years] & [2 (1.25, 3.5) years] (P values = 0.64 & 0.27; respectively). Patients in group 1 had significantly lower sperm concentrations [ 20 (5, 30) × 10 /mL], and normal forms [3 (2, 4) %] as compared to those in group 2 [ 30 (20, 72.5 × 10 /mL]; and [ 4 (3, 5) %] (P values = 0.03 & 0.005; respectively). Levels of seminal ORP were significantly higher in group 1 [3.04 (1.94, 7.75) mV/10 sperm/mL] as compared to group 2 [1.12 (0.42, 2.25) mV/10 sperm/mL]. A significant inverse correlation was found between ORP and sperm concentration (= -0.531, = 0.001), total sperm count ( = -0.453, = 0.008), progressive motility ( = -0.460, = 0.007), total motility ( = -0.526, = 0.002) and normal forms ( = -0.597, < 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between ORP and seminal leukocytes ( = 0.476, = 0.003).

Conclusions: Seminal ORP is significantly higher in infertile men with clinical varicocele as compared to those with no
 detectable abnormality in their genital examination (idiopathic infertility). These findings may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanism of increased ORP in a subset of infertile men with clinical varicocele. In addition, future studies may help determine those patients who would benefit from antioxidant therapy and/or surgical repair of varicocele.
 
RedoxSYS System for Research Use 
 
We completed the development of the RedoxSYS System (MiOXSYS’ predecessor product) during the two years preceding the April 2015 Merger. In 2014, we received ISO 13485 certification, demonstrating our compliance with global quality standards in medical device manufacturing. This enabled the launch of the RedoxSYS System into the research market around the world. We also received a CE marking in Europe in January 2016 and Health Canada clearance in March 2016 to begin the market development of the RedoxSYS System as a clinical diagnostic in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere around the world where CE marking is recognized. We launched sales efforts into the research market in late 2014 and since that time have placed the RedoxSYS System at a number of prominent research centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel. We expect to leverage these research relationships and build numerous applications in areas where researchers are studying oxidative stress. Currently, there are no available research platforms that measure oxidation-reduction potential in biologic fluids (i.e., blood, plasma, serum, semen, seminal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue, and cells). While oxidative stress is commonly studied in research settings around the world (both academia and industry), the current assessment methods are incomplete, time consuming, and often impractical for assessing oxidative stress completely. To position the RedoxSYS System effectively in the research market, we have placed key personnel in the United States, Europe, and Asia to develop direct research business relationships as well as distribution networks. Through these proof of concept studies and clinical exploratory studies, we identified the application of oxidation-reduction potential in male infertility assessment. As such, MiOXSYS was developed specifically for assessing semen and seminal plasma ORP levels. While we expect additional clinical applications to be developed through these applications, our near-term focus is on completing the development of MiOXSYS for use in semen analysis for male infertility assessment.
 
Background on the MiOXSYS System 
 
MiOXSYS is a novel, portable device that measures oxidation-reduction potential, or ORP, a global measure of oxidative stress. MiOXSYS is the first and only system that measures ORP in biologic specimens to provide a complete measure of redox balance, which is broadly implicated across a wide range of both acute and chronic conditions.
 
Potential Role of ORP in Diagnosing Male Infertility 
 
Oxidation-reduction potential is defined in the published literature as follows:
 
“ORP in a biological system is an integrated measure of the balance between total oxidants and reductants. In plasma, many constituents contribute to the ORP. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide ion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, transition metal ions, and hypochlorous acid, contribute to the oxidative potential. Plasma reductants include thiols, vitamin C, tocopherol, β-carotene, lycopene, uric acid, bilirubin, and flavonoids. Enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, or SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, are involved in the conversion of ROS into less reactive species. ORP monitoring of plasma represents a single measurement that integrates the overall quantitative balance among the oxidants and reductants of the system.”
 
Given that ORP represents a single, global measure of oxidative stress in a biological system, we believe the potential for ORP to serve as a standardized marker in semen analysis and other aspects of infertility assessment is significant. A major limitation of oxidative stress assays relates to the fact that there is poor standardization in testing. As many factors contribute to oxidative stress (e.g., free radical proliferation, antioxidant depletion, DNA damage, etc.), it is important to have an integrated measure that combines all known and unknown oxidants and reductants in the respective system into one measurement. We believe ORP is an integrated measure of oxidative stress that can be easily and quickly measured with the MiOXSYS System.

In the context of infertility, having an integrated value representing all relevant biologic constituents contributing to oxidative stress will enable simple, robust analysis in a two to three minute test. There are various techniques in use to assess semen in cases of male infertility. The most commonly implemented techniques involve DNA fragmentation, oxidative stress analysis, microscopic examination, sperm penetration assays, sperm agglutination, computer assisted semen analysis, and others. The currently available oxidative stress analysis tools are widely considered expensive and cumbersome to use in routine clinical practice. In both developed countries as well as in the developing world, expensive analysis tools and recurring reagent expenses make routine testing nearly impossible to implement with regularity.
 
The MiOXSYS System Overview 
 
The MiOXSYS System is comprised of two distinct, patented components that enable a system capable of measuring the ORP and antioxidant capacity of a biological fluid: an analyzer and sensor strips. In mechanical terms, ORP is defined as the potential between a working electrode, and a reference electrode at equilibrium. The RedoxSYS System has been specifically studied in human whole blood, serum, semen, seminal plasma, blood plasma, and other biological fluids.
 
The MiOXSYS System measures two distinct elements to determine a patient’s oxidation reduction potential:
 

• | Static ORP — the standard potential between a working electrode and a reference electrode with no driving current (or extremely small current). This is proportional to the balance of redox agents and is what is classically defined as ORP. Low ORP values mean that the biological sample is in the normal range of oxidative stress. Higher than normal ORP values means that the biological sample is in a higher oxidation state. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capacity — the measure of antioxidant reserve available in the body’s system. High capacity values mean that the biological sample has levels of antioxidant reserves. Lower than normal capacity values means that the biological sample has below normal antioxidant reserves. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MiOXSYS Analyzer 
 
The MiOXSYS analyzer is a portable, lightweight desktop platform that may be used in a clinical or research laboratory or near a patient care area. The analyzer is a small device that accepts an inserted sensor that has collected a small specimen as obtained by traditional specimen collection procedures. The analyzer is battery powered and equipped with a custom 5 lead strip connector. The reader consists of a Galvanostat analog circuit with greater than 1012 MHz input impedance.
 
The analyzer contains a 10 MHz external crystal (internal 4X PLL for 40 MHz operation), and a programming/serial header is externally accessible. The device has internal power/heart-beat indicator LED, primary storage of 128Mbit (16Mbyte) SPI Flash (3.3V) (Bulk data storage), and secondary storage of 2Mbit (256Kbyte) SPI FRAM (3.3V) (Hi-Speed Storage).
 
The MiOXSYS analyzer contains a user-friendly interface that is flexibly designed to accommodate multiple endpoints depending upon the specific clinical condition being considered. The interface is LCD, 16x2, with a white backlight, variable delay auto-off time-out. Two status LED indicators are visible through front panel mounted lenses. Further, the reader contains three DPDT push-button switches (Left, Center, Right), power on button(s) for battery mode operation, switch usage switch, audible alerts, strip detection, and test completion signals.
 
Further, the MiOXSYS analyzer enables data transfer, has USB serial communication, and is configured for data download to a connected PC.
 
The MiOXSYS analyzer’s power management consists of an external 5VDC power jack with input capacitance and filtering, a boost converter supplied by external 5VDC power or internal Li-Ion battery, and provides main 5VDC digital board supply. The reader functions with or without the battery connected. The battery lasts in excess of 24 hours with continuous operation to enable prolonged use outside of a laboratory setting.

The MiOXSYS Sensor Strips 
 
The MiOXSYS sensor strips, via standard biological specimen collection techniques, receive 20 – 40 microliters of a specimen from which the ORP clinical analysis is performed. The ORP sensor strips are small, disposable, and biocompatible and consist of a ceramic substrate and a five-lead configuration. Significant intellectual property surrounds the design, construct, and electrochemical algorithms associated with the sensors.
 
Image of the MiOXSYS Sensor Strips 
 


Regulatory Pathway 
 
We achieved ISO 13485: 2003 in late 2013 following the successful development of a compliant medical device quality system. Following the issuance of our ISO certification, we obtained CE marking for the RedoxSYS System, which has enabled initial market development in Europe and markets that accept a CE marking. In December 2015, we achieved CE marking for MiOXSYS following technical validation and clinical study completion in male infertility. In March 2016, we obtained Health Canada Class II Medical approvals for MiOXSYS. In the United States, we intend to pursue 510k clearance with the FDA for the MiOXSYS System. We have recent, ongoing correspondence with the FDA and have confirmed that MiOXSYS is appropriate for the 510k pathway, and we are pursuing regulatory clearance through this pathway.
United States Commercial Strategy 
 
If the clinical studies to measure oxidative stress in male infertility are successful, we expect to pursue that intended use for the MiOXSYS System via the FDA 510k pathway. If cleared for the infertility intended use, we intend to seek to commercialize the MiOXSYS System as a new tool for the assessment of oxidative stress in infertility in men. We envision pursuing a direct sales effort to high priority urology/andrology laboratories, infertility clinics and reference centers across the United States. We have identified the primary, influential centers in the United States and believe our commercial deployment will be efficient through a focused sales and marketing effort. We intend to seek to sell the MiOXSYS System into individual centers and laboratories but will focus our revenue model on the repeat ordering of the disposable, single use MiOXSYS sensor strips. We expect to realize a favorable gross margin on the basis of estimated low cost of goods sold on both components of the system. We envision an average selling price for the disposable sensors of approximately $25. We envision selling the MiOXSYS analyzers for approximately $2,500 but will also pursue an instrument rental agreement model with minimum disposable sensor purchase requirements.
 
We also intend to leverage our urology commercialization efforts with other products with a focus on urology centers, infertility clinics, and reproductive health laboratories around the United States.
 
We believe a focused sales force at the onset of commercialization will enable effective representation of our products and penetration of the reproductive health market. Our sales efforts into the research markets will be enabled initially through a full-time business development professional who will focus on collaborative research and research sales to major oxidative stress centers in the United States. We expect to pursue identical pricing in the research market and the clinical diagnostics markets.

ROW Commercial Strategy 
 
We intend to undertake a similar strategy outside the United States for the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS Systems while complementing our efforts in infertility and research with adjunct applications in critical care conditions. To efficiently execute across our strategy, we intend to utilize a network of established distributors in the target markets in Europe and Asia. We have already established distribution arrangements with multiple distributors in multiple countries, and through these distributors, we have sold MiOXSYS in over 20 countries around the world. We anticipate slightly reduced pricing outside the U.S. for the disposable sensors given the anticipated lower pricing observed ex-US for diagnostic and research products.
Nuelle and the Fiera® Personal Care Device
 
Fiera is a revenue-generating women’s personal care product marketed in the United States primarily through consumer promotion. Fiera is the first of its kind, hands-free, personal care device for women that enhances physical arousal and interest in sex. In scientific and consumer studies conducted with hundreds of women with stated sexual desire and response concerns, Fiera has demonstrated highly consistent benefit. Importantly, Fiera is also endorsed by and receives professional recommendations from leading sexual health experts across the United States and has been studied and presented by the same experts.


Fiera was created with OB-GYNs and has multiple scientific studies showing it works. Fiera helps women who have changing levels of arousal, interest, and vaginal dryness, enter a sexual experience with enhanced levels of excitement and interest. Fiera works naturally with a woman’s body and provides a hands-free experience thanks to the innovative design. Fiera uses light stimulation and a gentle suction action to enhance blood flow and increase lubrication in advance of sex, in as little as 5 minutes.

The Fiera SofSense™ Rings
 
The Fiera SofSense™ ring refills are available and sold in two styles, for a custom fit. Each refill box contains three SofSense™ rings, and each ring is designed to be used up to five times.
United States-Based Consumer Study
 
Fiera has been extensively studied and tested by consumers and physicians. Fiera is scientifically proven to enhance genital arousal in women of all ages, including pre and post-menopausal women.
 
Consumer study results in women ages 25-75 showed that after 4 weeks of using Fiera + Remote:


· | 97% of women felt physically aroused
--+-------------------------------------


· | 96% looked forward to being intimate with their partner
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | 93% felt excited and ready for sex
--+-----------------------------------


· | 89% of women felt more “in the mood”
--+-------------------------------------


· | 87% felt as ready for sex as their partner did
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
Previous studies also showed that 87% of women felt increased desire and 67% felt increased lubrication. In a separate scientific study of pre and post-menopausal women, arousal occurred on average in 5 minutes.
 
Clinical Data on the Fiera Personal Care Device
 
Fiera serves several important functions:
 
1. | It helps to encourage blood flow in the clitoris (vasocongestion), a key physical reaction that signals your body that you are ready for sex. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | It provides direct stimulation, accelerating the effect of the suction. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | A soft, silicone ring adheres with a gentle suction holding the product in place so that your hands are free. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Fiera is tucked under the labia and worn over the clitoris, a woman’s most sensitive sexual organ to enhance arousal through a proprietary combination of gentle suction and multi-focal stimulation. As the nerve endings in the clitoris respond, a woman begins to experience enhanced sensation to the genital area, which triggers a physical state of arousal.
 
Our research shows that use of Fiera regularly over a 4-week period also increases a woman’s level of sexual desire. Women also report looking forward to and enjoying sexual activity more.
 
A study of 14 sexually active, premenopausal women was conducted to determine the degree of engorgement – as measured by temperature change in the external genitalia – produced by Fiera. Fiera produced statistically significant increases in vulvar temperatures, which is a marker of genital blood flow and engorgement. 100% of study participants reported feeling “In the Mood” for sex after use of Fiera. Additionally, 100% of study participants experienced genital sexual arousal during use of Fiera. Another study of 12 sexually active, postmenopausal women demonstrated that Fiera produced statistically significant increases in vulvar temperature. Use of Fiera in this population of postmenopausal women produced sexual desire in 100% of the subjects while 83% experienced genital arousal.

ProstaScint for the Detection of Prostate Cancer 
 
On May 20, 2015, we acquired ProstaScint® from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. The ProstaScint Kit, or capromab pendetide, is a radio-labeled monoclonal antibody, which is a biologic product that targets a specific antigen. ProstaScint targets prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, a protein uniquely expressed by prostate tissue. A radioactive substance called Indium (In 111) is attached to the proprietary, mouse-derived antibody. The radiolabeled antibody is infused into the patient and is taken up by prostate cancer cells which can be detected and visualized with a special nuclear medicine scan (single-photon emission tomography, or SPECT). ProstaScint has been shown to be clinically effective in determining the course of treatment for a patient who has had a prostatectomy and/or has suspected metastasis (spread of the cancer cells beyond the prostate). Further, ProstaScint has demonstrated efficacy in patients classified as high risk or with recurrent prostate cancer. ProstaScint has been approved by the FDA and Health Canada, and significant clinical data exist demonstrating the significant predictive value in prostate cancer staging. At June 30, 2017, the ProstaScint asset was impaired based upon sales projections that we intend to only sell this product through mid-fiscal 2019, when this product expires.
 
Prostate Cancer Market 
 
According to the American Cancer Society prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 241,000 annual cases (as of 2012). Further, more than 2.2 million men were alive in 2006 with some history of prostate cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. The effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies. The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is expected to total $17.4 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 7.5% since 2012. Importantly, ProstaScint is the only FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical (for use in radioimmunoscintigraphy) specifically indicated for prostate cancer screening and is specifically highlighted in the American Cancer Society practice guidelines for prostate cancer screening and staging.
 
Prostate cancer is classified into four stages based on severity: Stages 1 through 4. Stage 3 is considered “high risk” and Stage 4 is when cancer has become metastatic. Radioimmunoscintigraphy has been established as a diagnostic to stage cancer malignancy and one of the most widespread clinical uses has been for the detection of prostate cancer.
 
ProstaScint Clinical Data 
 
Multiple clinical studies have been conducted in the United States and published in peer-reviewed publications that consistently demonstrate substantial clinical efficacy of ProstaScint in staging prostate cancer patients and specifically identify whether the cancer is confined to the prostate or has metastasized to other parts of the body. Through more accurate clinical staging and identification of metastatic prostate cancer, clinicians are able to better direct therapeutic interventions and improve outcomes. A brief summary of key clinical findings for ProstaScint from select studies are summarized below.

Principal Investigator(s)/ Primary Authors | Publication | Patient Population | Conclusion/Results

Radiation oncology experts have published numerous papers expressing the potential for expanded use of ProstaScint in prostate cancer imaging due to advances in imaging technologies since the product’s initial approval. Since the early 2000s, significantly greater image resolution has been enabled due to the advent of dual head cameras (and improved imaging in general) along with the use of co-registered images where radiologists now combine the images of SPECT and computerized tomography, or CT, or magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. Because of these factors, we believe there is significant commercial opportunity for ProstaScint.
 
ProstaScint Product Information 
 
ProstaScint is provided as a two-vial kit which contains all of the non-radioactive ingredients necessary to produce a single unit dose for administration by intravenous injection. The ProstaScint vial contains 0.5 mg of capromab pendetide in 1 mL of sodium phosphate buffered saline solution adjusted to pH 6; a sterile, pyrogen-free, clear, colorless solution that may contain some translucent particles. The vial of sodium acetate buffer contains 82 mg of sodium acetate in 2 mL of water for injection adjusted to pH 5 – 7 with glacial acetic acid; it is a sterile, pyrogen-free, clear, and colorless solution. Neither solution contains a preservative.
 
Each kit also includes one sterile 0.22 μm Millex® GV filter, prescribing information, and two identification labels. The hospital is responsible for addition of Indium (In 111). ProstaScint may also be helpful in conjunction with other scans (CT or MRI) for higher risk patients, by detecting lymph nodes in the abdomen that are involved with prostate cancer cells, but may still appear falsely normal on CT or MRI scans.
 
The procedure to administer ProstaScint is as follows: the patient is given an intravenous, or IV, infusion of the monoclonal antibody, and 30 minutes later, a scan is performed. A second scan is done between 96 and 120 hours (4 – 5 days) after the infusion. The first scan (on the day of the infusion) takes approximately 1 hour, while the second scan takes approximately 2.5 hours.
 
ProstaScint Uses 
 
ProstaScint is indicated as a diagnostic imaging agent in newly-diagnosed patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer, thought to be clinically-localized after standard diagnostic evaluation (e.g. chest x-ray, bone scan, CT scan, or MRI), who are at high-risk for pelvic lymph node metastases. It is not indicated in patients who are not at high risk.
 
ProstaScint is also indicated as a diagnostic imaging agent in post-prostatectomy patients with a rising PSA and a negative or equivocal standard metastatic evaluation in whom there is a high clinical suspicion of occult metastatic disease. The imaging performance of Indium (In 111) ProstaScint following radiation therapy has not been studied.
 
The information provided by Indium (In 111) ProstaScint imaging should be considered in conjunction with other diagnostic information. Scans that are positive for metastatic disease should be confirmed histologically in patients who are otherwise candidates for surgery or radiation therapy unless medically contraindicated. Scans that are negative for metastatic disease should not be used in lieu of histological confirmation. ProstaScint is not indicated as a screening tool for carcinoma of the prostate nor for re-administration for the purpose of assessment of response to treatment.
 
ProstaScint was initially marketed by Cytogen Corporation, which was acquired by EUSA Pharma. Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired EUSA in June 2012 but significantly reduced promotion of ProstaScint due to a lack of strategic focus. Despite limited commercialization efforts, peak annual unit sales of ProstaScint of 8,216 kits were achieved. At current pricing, this unit sales volume would equate to approximately $14.6 million in annual revenue.
 
In late fiscal 2017, we decided to implement a harvest strategy for the ProstaScint product, due to increased competition and the cost to continue manufacturing. Based upon our current projections, we believe that we will continue to sell this product through fiscal 2018 and the first half of fiscal 2019.

Our Business Development Strategy — Identifying & Acquiring Complementary Urology Assets 
 
A key growth and value driver for our Company is the ongoing identification and acquisition of novel urology products for commercialization. We seek to identify unique products with urologic indications that may be non-strategic, undervalued or under-resourced by the company that currently markets the product. We believe that we can continue to acquire strategically aligned products at an appropriate valuation and grow those products via our focused sales and marketing efforts. We will also consider acquiring novel, late-stage development products that represent unique commercial opportunities and can be efficiently developed.
 
We will continue to look to identify unique product assets to acquire based on specific attributes including but not limited to: therapeutic area/indication; growth potential; intellectual property position (patents, regulatory, manufacturing or development technicalities, etc.); valuation; strategic fit; commercial orientation and other factors. Indications of interest include products to treat conditions such as urinary incontinence, sexual wellness and vitality, hypogonadism, prostate and other urological cancers, urinary tract infections, and other urological conditions. However, during fiscal 2018, our primary focus will be on growing our current core assets and working towards cash-flow breakeven.
 
Government Regulation
 
While we do not have any pharmaceutical product candidates that we are actively developing as of the date of this Report, we may in the future acquire such products. Currently, we are developing two medical device candidates, the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS Systems, for which regulatory approval must be received before we can market them within the United States. Regulatory approval processes for our current and any future product candidates are discussed below.
Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products 
 
FDA Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products 
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves the performance of satisfactory nonclinical, also referred to as pre-clinical, laboratory and animal studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulation, the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes, which conform to FDA mandated current good manufacturing requirements, or cGMP, including a quality system regulating manufacturing, the submission and acceptance of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States, obtaining the approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought, and the submission to the FDA for review and approval of an NDA. Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Pre-clinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. Results of these pre-clinical tests, together with chemistry, manufacturing controls and analytical data and the clinical trial protocol, which details the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, along with other requirements must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials can begin. The entire clinical trial and its protocol must be in compliance with what are referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. The term, GCP, is used to refer to various FDA laws and regulations, as well as international scientific standards intended to protect the rights, health and safety of patients, define the roles of clinical trial sponsors and assure the integrity of clinical trial data.
 
An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. Pre-clinical studies generally take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing clinical testing to begin. In addition to FDA review of an IND, each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or Ethics Committee, or EC. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, and the selection and safety of human subjects. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. The FDA and/or IRB may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial or that a specific clinical trial site be halted at any time, or impose other sanctions for failure to comply with requirements under the appropriate entity jurisdiction.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1 clinical trials, a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used.
 
The main purpose of the trial is to assess a product candidate’s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate. Phase 1 clinical trials generally include less than 50 subjects or patients. During Phase 2 trials, a product candidate is studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to: (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product candidate for specific target diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for Phase 3 trials. Phase 3 trials are generally undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. Phase 3 trials are generally designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the candidate product’s clinical efficacy and adequate information for labeling of the approved drug.
 
There are three main types of NDAs, which are covered by Section 505 of the FDC Act: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy (Section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the application has not obtained a right of reference (Section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (Section 505(j)). Section 505(b)(2) expressly permits the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. In the pre-IND briefing meeting with Ampio and in June 2012, the FDA agreed that our NDA may be submitted under Section 505(b)(2). As such, we intend to rely on studies published in the scientific literature and reference FDA-approved NDAs for tramadol-containing products (NDAs 21-693, 20-281 and 21-692) to support the safety and efficacy demonstrated in our clinical program.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently approximately $100,000 per product and $600,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks.

REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book that: 1) the required patent information has not been filed; 2) the listed patent has expired; 3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted, unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent — in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on the approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use; the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by, or for, the applicant.
 
Post-Approval Regulation 
 
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals.

If the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, we and the contract manufacturers we use for manufacture of clinical supplies and commercial supplies must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product or medical devices, also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
 
Approval Process for Medical Devices 
 
In the United States, the FDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale and distribution of medical devices, including molecular diagnostic test kits and instrumentation systems. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510k clearance, and premarket approval, also called PMA approval. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, known as the Quality System Regulations, or QSR. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
 
Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510k clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Some Class I devices that have not been so exempted and Class II devices are eligible for marketing through the 510k clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III require PMA approval prior to commercial marketing. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510k clearance process, however, the 510k clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive. The FDA has provided initial guidance to us that the MiOXSYS and RedoxSYS Systems are appropriate for the 510k clearance process.
 
510k Clearance. To obtain 510k clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally marketed in the United States that is not subject to PMA approval, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510k clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
 
After a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510k clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

Before we can submit a medical device for 510k clearance, we may have to perform a series of generally short studies over a period of months, including method comparison, reproducibility, interference and stability studies to ensure that users can perform the test successfully. Some of these studies may take place in clinical environments, but are not usually considered clinical trials. For PMA submissions, we would generally be required to conduct a longer clinical trial over a period of years that supports the clinical utility of the device and how the device will be used.
 
Although clinical investigations of most devices are subject to the investigational device exemption, or IDE, requirements, clinical investigations of diagnostic tests, including our products and products under development, are generally exempt from the IDE requirements. Thus, clinical investigations by intended users for intended uses of our products generally do not require the FDA’s prior approval but may require approval of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, and written informed consent by the patient, provided the clinical evaluation testing is non-invasive, does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents a significant risk, does not intentionally introduce energy into the subject and is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established test or procedure. In addition, our products must be labeled per FDA regulations “for research use only-RUO” or “for investigational use only-IUO,” and distribution controls must be established to assure that our products distributed for research, method comparisons or clinical evaluation studies are used only for those purposes.
 
Regulation after FDA Clearance or Approval 
 
Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which include, among other things, testing, control and documentation requirements. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions, fines and imprisonment. Our contract manufacturers’ facilities operate under the FDA’s cGMP requirements.
 
Foreign Regulatory Approval 
 
Outside of the United States, our ability to market our product candidates will be contingent also upon our receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and differ from those required for FDA approval.
 
In the European Union, we are required under the European Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) to affix the CE mark to certain of our products in order to sell the products in member countries of the European Union. The CE mark is an international symbol that represents adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness mandated in the European Medical Device Directive, which are referred to as the “essential requirements”. Once affixed, the CE mark enables a product to be sold within the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein as well as other countries that accept the CE mark.
 
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile) where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a notified body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The notified body issues a CE certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
 
If we modify our devices, we may need to apply for permission to affix the CE mark to the modified product. Additionally, we may need to apply for a CE mark for any new products that we may develop in the future. Certain products regulated as medical devices according to EC-Directives are subject to vigilance requirements for reporting of adverse events.
 
We will be subject to additional regulations in other countries in which we market, sell and import our products, including Canada. We or our distributors must receive all necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing and/or importing our products in those markets.

The International Standards Organization, or ISO, promulgates internationally recognized standards, including those for the requirements of quality systems. To support ISO certifications, surveillance audits are conducted by a notified body yearly and recertification audits every three years that assess continued compliance with the relevant ISO standards.
 
Other Regulatory Matters 
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Health Care Reform Law, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, imprisonment or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 
United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and other specific aspects of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if any of our NDA’s are approved, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.

33

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. Recently, the FDA stated that it may change its interpretation of 5-year NCE exclusivity determinations to apply to each drug substance in a fixed-combination drug product, not for the drug product as a whole. If this change is implemented, for example, a fixed-combination drug product that contains a drug substance with a single, new active moiety would be eligible for 5 year NCE exclusivity, even if the fixed-combination also contains a drug substance with a previously approved active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 
Reimbursement 
 
Natesto is covered by many commercial insurance providers and pharmacy benefit management companies and is largely dependent upon reimbursement for continued use in the U.S. market. Natesto is also covered under a Rebate Agreement between us and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This, in turn, enables states to offer public payer coverage of Natesto through their separate Medicare and public assistance programs. Additionally, privately managed Medicare Part D plans may choose to cover Natesto prescriptions through their plans’ pharmacy benefits. ProstaScint is dependent upon reimbursement for continued use in the U.S. market, and ProstaScint does have a reimbursement code as assigned by the American Medical Association. ProstaScint is currently reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, and various private health plans. However, reimbursement is not universally available throughout the United States for ProstaScint. We do not anticipate that the sales of the MiOXSYS System, if approved for sale in the U.S., will be heavily dependent upon reimbursement by third-party payors. Traditionally, sales of pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, ad devices that are not “lifestyle” indications depend, in part, on the extent to which products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The sexual wellness market is typically known as a cash payor market, and because Fiera is not classified as a pharmaceutical or a medical device by the FDA, there will be no reimbursement paid by third parties on the product.
 
Lack of third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
DEA Regulation 
 
Natesto, already approved by the FDA, is a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, because it contains testosterone. As a result, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agencies, or DEA, regulate Natesto and have listed it as a Schedule III substance.
 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities.
 

34
--

 

The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs.
 
The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our or our manufacturers’ quotas of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our or our manufacturers’ quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 
To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 
Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Aytu has an exclusive license from Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation for the United States to intellectual property related to a nasal gel drug product containing testosterone to treat hypogonadism in males, including the FDA approved product Natesto®, as well as an authorized generic version and OTC versions thereof. The license includes sublicense rights to intellectual property owned by Mattern Pharmaceuticals and exclusively licensed to Acerus by Mattern Pharmaceuticals. The sublicensed intellectual property includes four Orange Book listed patents directed at nasal gel formulations containing testosterone or methods of testosterone replacement therapy by nasal administration of the same. It further includes three patents that are not listed in the Orange Book directed at a testosterone formulation, a method of making a testosterone formulation and a method for reducing physical or chemical interactions between a nasal testosterone formulation and a plastic container.
 
The Acerus license also grants rights to intellectual property owned by Acerus which includes ten nonprovisional patent applications, some of which may be abandoned. These patent applications include at least four pending applications directed to testosterone titration methods, intranasal testosterone bio-adhesive gel formulations, and controlled release testosterone formulations.

The Fiera portfolio includes multiple utility patent families in the United States and foreign jurisdictions with claims to the Fiera device. The United States portfolio includes one issued patent and nine pending applications; the foreign portfolio includes six issued patents, nine pending applications and one PCT application. In addition, Fiera is protected by a substantial design patent portfolio with four issued United States design patents and three pending United States design applications. As well, the design portfolio includes forty-one issued design patents.
 
ProstaScint is protected by significant trade secrets and manufacturing know-how related to the production of the product and linkage of the base monoclonal antibody and imaging component. The antibody in the ProstaScint product is produced by a proprietary cell line.
 
We also maintain trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. If we do not adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed.
 
We expect to seek United States and foreign patent protection for drug and diagnostic products we discover, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. We expect also to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect certain other technologies which may be used to discover and characterize drugs and diagnostic products and processes, and which may be used to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes.
 
The patent positions of companies such as ours involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued and licensed patents, and those that may be issued to us in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under the patents or licenses may not provide us with meaningful protection or competitive advantages. Our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, which could offset any advantages we might otherwise realize from our intellectual property. Furthermore, even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the time required for development, testing, and regulatory review could mean that protection afforded us by our patents may only remain in effect for a short period after commercialization. The expiration of patents or license rights we hold could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our pharmaceutical drugs or diagnostics, thus harming our operating results and financial position.
 
We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties primarily to the extent that such rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If we must litigate to protect our intellectual property from infringement, we may incur substantial costs and our officers may be forced to devote significant time to litigation-related matters. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our pending patent applications, or those we may file or license from third parties in the future, may not result in patents being issued. Until a patent is issued, the claims covered by an application for patent may be narrowed or removed entirely, thus depriving us of adequate protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing product candidates to market exceeds the returns we are likely to obtain. We are generally aware of the scientific research being conducted in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts, but patent applications filed by others are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months and, in some cases in the United States, until the patent is issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific literature often occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. As a result, it is possible that patent applications for products similar to our drug or diagnostic products and product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and it is possible that our development of products and product candidates could be challenged by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If we become involved in litigation concerning the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, we may incur significant litigation or licensing expenses, be prevented from further developing or commercializing a product or product candidate, be required to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or subject us to compensatory or punitive damage awards. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business.
 
Competition 
 
The healthcare industry is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope of regulatory approvals; government reimbursement rates for, and the average selling price of, products; the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent rights and their protection; and sales and marketing capabilities. Market acceptance of our current products and product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies or tests, (ii) the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products, (iii) the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, and (iv) the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.
 
We are a very small life sciences company compared to other companies that we are competing against. Our current and potential competitors include large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, and medical device companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly more experience in the marketing, commercialization, discovery, development and regulatory approvals of products, which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage or deny us marketing exclusivity rights. Specifically, our competitors will most likely have larger sales teams and have more capital resources to support their products then we do.
 
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in achieving widespread market acceptance and obtaining FDA approval for product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market, as advanced technologies become available and as generic forms of currently branded products become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products non-competitive or obsolete.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our products that we acquire or successfully develop will be clinically superior or scientifically preferable to products developed or introduced by our competitors.
 
Our current approved products compete in highly competitive fields whereby there are numerous options available to clinicians including generics. These generic treatment options are frequently less expensive and more widely available.
 
Natesto
 
Natesto competes in a growing market. The U.S. TRT market is large, with annual revenues in the U.S. in 2016 of approximately $2.0 billion. At the current market size of approximately $2.0 billion, a product with 5% market penetration could achieve sales of approximately $100 million annually, assuming comparatively similar product pricing and reimbursement levels as seen with other TRTs.
 
The U.S. prescription testosterone market is comprised primarily of topically applied treatments in the form of gels, solutions, and patches. Testopel® and Aveed®, injectable products typically implanted directly under the skin by a physician, are also FDA-approved. AndroGel is the market-leading TRT and is marketed by AbbVie.
 
ProstaScint 
 
Currently, there are several FDA approved imaging techniques for cancer in general, however there is only one SPECT-specific agent targeting prostate cancer — ProstaScint. The other imaging methods are F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F18-FDG), C11-Acetate, and C11-Choline. The primary advantage of these methods is that they all use PET imaging, a technique with better resolution than SPECT. The use of PET is also a disadvantage, however, since it uses radiolabels with short half-lives necessitating the need for a local or on-site cyclotron to generate the labels. The half-life of fluorine-18 (F18) and of carbon-11 (C11) are approximately 110 and 20 minutes, respectively. The radiolabel used by ProstaScint is Indium-11, with a half-life of about 2 – 3 days. This longer time period allows the radiolabel to be made remotely and shipped to the imaging facility; however, it does use SPECT as the imaging modality.

As indicated, ProstaScint is the only radio-imaging marker that is specific for prostate specific membrane antigen (PMSA). ProstaScint is based on radiolabeling the antibody against PSMA, a protein express by prostate cells. This specificity for prostate cells is what allows ProstaScint to detect the metastases of prostate cancer regardless of location. The mechanism of labeling for F18-FDG, C11-Acetate, and C11-Choline is the intracellular accumulation of these markers in cancer cells, due to the fact that cancer cells typically have a higher cellular metabolism than non-cancerous cells. Thus, these markers can accumulate in any type of cancer cell with a high metabolism. Unfortunately for these technologies, prostate cancer cells tend to have a lower cellular metabolism resulting in higher false positives attributed to hyperplasia and prostatitis.
 
In a meta-analysis of 21 studies evaluating accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, ProstaScint using combined SPECT/CT imaging was comparable to PET/CT imaging based on F18-FDG and C11-Choline.
 
MiOXSYS/RedoxSYS 
 
With respect to MiOXSYS competitive offerings, there are other oxidative stress diagnostic tests available throughout the world, although none are approved in the United States for clinical use. Diagnostic systems that are marketed for clinical use outside the United States include the FRAS 4 system (H&D srl), FREE Carpe Diem (Diacron International), and the FORM and FORMPlus systems (Callegari srl). These systems are used in both research and clinical settings but do not generate significant sales in the clinical setting. If approved in the United States for clinical use, these systems could present competition to the MiOXSYS System. However, their testing parameters differ significantly from MiOXSYS and would need to demonstrate clinical superiority to MiOXSYS in order to substantially detract from MiOXSYS prescribing and sales. Additionally, to our knowledge these systems have not demonstrated clinical feasibility in human semen or seminal plasma.
 
Research and Development 
 
Our strategy is to minimize our research and development activities. When we do conduct research and development, we intend to utilize consultants with domain experience for research, development and regulatory guidance.
 
Our MiOXSYS System has been developed in conjunction with numerous medical device and diagnostic development consultants. Further, we have relationships with regulatory consultants who are actively assisting in the development of our regulatory strategy with the FDA. To complement our internal clinical research efforts with the MiOXSYS System, we have engaged with numerous universities around the world to identify and develop research and clinical applications for the MiOXSYS System. Through these engagements we have access to data and analyses that enable us to develop new uses for the MiOXSYS and RedoxSYS systems. Additionally, we have formal research agreements in place with two prominent U.S.-based universities and one prominent European university for which we are paying a research fee.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our business strategy is to use cGMP compliant contract manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical supplies as well as for commercial supplies if required by our commercialization plans, and to transfer manufacturing responsibility to our collaboration partners when possible.
Natesto
 
On April 22, 2016, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Acerus pursuant to which we will pay Acerus a supply price per unit of the greater of (i) a fixed percentage of Acerus’ cost of goods sold for Natesto, not to exceed a fixed ceiling price and (ii) a low double digit percentage of the net selling price for the first year of the agreement, that increases in each of the second and third years and remains constant after that.
 
ProstaScint 
 
We have acquired a two-year supply of ProstaScint through our asset purchase agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which we project to last through fiscal 2018 and the first half of fiscal 2019.

MiOXSYS/RedoxSYS 
 
We have completed the technical development of the RedoxSYS System by engaging contract development and manufacturing companies in the United States. We secured supply and quality agreements with manufacturers for both the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS instruments as well as the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS sensor strips. Both manufacturers hold long-standing ISO 13485:2003 certifications and are established medical device manufacturers. Both manufacturers have high volume manufacturing capacity such that production volumes can be easily scaled. Both manufacturers have been audited by our quality engineers and are fully compliant.
 
Employees 
 
As of August 15, 2017, we had 63 full-time employees and utilized the services of a number of consultants on a temporary basis. Overall, we have not experienced any work stoppage and do not anticipate any work stoppage in the foreseeable future. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that relations with our employees are good.
