Item 1.Business.
Company Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on September 25, 2020 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
On September 30, 2020, our Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain of our offering costs in consideration of 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001. On December 14, 2020, our Sponsor transferred 25,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of our independent directors. These 100,000 shares will not be subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised. On January 5, 2021, we effected a share dividend, resulting in 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on January 5, 2021. On January 8, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 34,500,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000. Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 9,400,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement (the “private placement warrants”) to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $9,400,000. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants were added to the net proceeds from the initial public offering held in a trust account. If we do not complete a business combination within 24 months from the consummation of the initial public offering, the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law).
The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account if we do not consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of our initial public offering plus the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued or to be issued to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, its affiliates or any member of our management team upon conversion of any working capital loans. In no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one.
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they 

1



otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter or (2) our annual revenues are less than $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
Proposed Business Combination
On September 16, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Gogoro, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of Cayman Islands, Starship Merger Sub I Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gogoro (“Merger Sub”) and Starship Merger Sub II Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gogoro (“Merger Sub II”), pursuant to which, among other transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Poema Global (the “First Merger”), with Poema Global surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogoro, and (ii) Poema Global will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, collectively, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub II surviving the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gogoro (the “Business Combination”).
The Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby were approved by the board of directors of each of Poema Global and Gogoro Inc. On November 18, 2021, Gogoro Inc. filed a preliminary proxy statement on Form F-4 (File No: 333-261181) (as amended, the “Registration Statement”) relating to the Business Combination. On March 17, 2022, the Registration Statement was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We have filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC and mailed the definitive proxy statement to our shareholders. The Business Combination is expected to close in April 2022, subject to approval by our shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
The Business Combination
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the approval of the Poema Global shareholders, among other things, (i) immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Effective Time”), each Class B ordinary share of Poema Global, par value $0.0001 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will be automatically converted into one Class A ordinary share of Poema Global, par value $0.0001 per share and, after giving effect to such automatic conversion and the Unit Separation (as defined below), at the First Effective Time and as a result of the First Merger, each issued and outstanding Class A ordinary share will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share of Gogoro (“Gogoro Ordinary Share”) after giving effect to the Recapitalization (as defined below), and (ii) each issued and outstanding warrant of Poema Global sold to the public and to the Sponsor, in a private placement in connection with Poema Global’s initial public offering (“Poema Global Warrants”) will automatically and irrevocably be assumed by Gogoro and converted into a corresponding warrant exercisable for Gogoro Ordinary Shares (“Gogoro Warrants”). Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the Class A ordinary shares and the public warrants comprising each issued and outstanding unit of Poema Global, consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one public warrant, will be automatically separated (“Unit Separation”) and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one public warrant. No fractional public warrants will be issued in connection with the Unit 

2



Separation such that if a holder of such Poema Global Units would be entitled to receive a fractional public warrant upon such separation, the number of public warrants to be issued to such holder upon such separation will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of public warrants and no cash will be paid in lieu of such fractional public warrants.
Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (i) each series C preferred shares of Gogoro (“Gogoro Series C Preferred Shares”), outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time, will be repurchased by Gogoro for cash consideration in an amount equal to the initial subscription price for such Gogoro Series C Preferred Shares and each holder of a Gogoro Series C Preferred Share will, immediately upon receipt of such cash consideration, apply such amount to the subscription for one Gogoro Ordinary Share; (ii) the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association of Gogoro shall be adopted and become effective, and (iii) Gogoro shall effect a share subdivision of each Gogoro Ordinary Share into such number of Gogoro Ordinary Shares equal to the Subdivision Factor, such that each Gogoro Ordinary Share will have a value of $10.00 per share after giving effect to such share subdivision (the “Share Subdivision”) (items (i) through (iii), the “Recapitalization”).
The “Subdivision Factor” is a number resulting from dividing (i) the Gogoro Equity Value by (ii) the product of (x) the Aggregate Fully Diluted Gogoro Shares, and (y) 10. The “Gogoro Equity Value” (being $2,011,251,500) is the value of Gogoro as adjusted by its cash and indebtedness as of June 30, 2021. The “Aggregate Fully Diluted Gogoro Shares” means, without duplication, (i) the aggregate number of Gogoro Ordinary Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Share Subdivision (including restricted shares (whether vested or unvested) granted under Gogoro’s equity incentive plans) and (ii) the aggregate number of Gogoro Ordinary Shares that are reserved for issuance under the Gogoro’s equity incentive plans (whether or not issuable in respect of a specific equity or equity-linked award). As of the date hereof, Gogoro has 20,000,000 redeemable preferred shares in issue, which will be redeemed by Gogoro prior to the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Conditions to Closing
The consummation of the Business Combination is conditioned upon, among other things: (i) receipt of the required approval by the Poema Global shareholders; (ii) receipt of the required approval by the Gogoro shareholders; (iii) after giving effect to the exercise of the redemption rights of the Poema Global shareholders (the “Poema Global Shareholder Redemption”), Poema Global having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets immediately after the First Effective Time; (iv) the absence of any law or governmental order enjoining, prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Mergers; (v) the approval for listing of Gogoro Ordinary Shares, Gogoro Warrants, Gogoro Ordinary Shares underlying Gogoro Warrants to be issued in connection with the Mergers upon the Closing and the Earnout Shares (as defined below) on the Nasdaq, subject only to official notice of issuance thereof; (vi) effectiveness of the Registration Statement in accordance with the Securities Act and the absence of any stop order issued by the SEC which remains in effect with respect to the Registration Statement; and (vii) completion of the Recapitalization in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and Gogoro’s organizational documents.
The obligations of Gogoro, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II to consummate the Business Combination is also conditioned upon, among other things: (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Poema Global (subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement); (ii) material compliance by Poema Global with its pre-closing covenants; (iii) the funds contained in Poema Global’s trust account (after giving effect to the Poema Global Shareholder Redemption and net of any unpaid or contingent liabilities of Poema Global including any deferred underwriting commissions and transaction expenses), together with the aggregate amount of proceeds from any PIPE Financing (as defined below) and any amount raised pursuant to the permitted equity financing prior to the Closing, equaling or exceeding $400,000,000 (the “Minimum Available Cash Condition”); (iv) the absence of any event that would or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of Poema Global to consummate the Business Combination or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Business Combination; and (v) the Sponsor Support Agreement (as defined below) being in full force and effect. 
The obligations of Poema Global to consummate the Business Combination is also conditioned upon, among other things: (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Gogoro (subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement); (ii) material compliance by Gogoro with its pre-closing covenants; and (iii) the absence of any effect, development, circumstance, fact, change or event since the date of the Merger Agreement that has had a material adverse effect on (x) Gogoro and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or the results of operations or financial condition of Gogoro and its subsidiaries, in each case, taken as a whole or (y) the ability of Gogoro and its subsidiaries to consummate the Business Combination.

Subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, one-third of the Earnout Shares are issuable if over any twenty trading days within any thirty trading day period during the Earnout Period the volume-weighted average price of the Gogoro Ordinary Shares is greater than or equal to $15.00, $17.50 and $20.00, respectively (each, an “Earnout Event”).

One-third of the incentive awards under the Incentive Award Pool shall vest upon the occurrence of an Earnout Event during the Earnout Period, subject to the Continuing Employee’s continued service to Gogoro or any of its subsidiaries through each such Earnout Event.

The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of such agreement or other specific dates.

The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the parties to the Merger Agreement.

Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and other terms may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Poema Global’s public disclosures.

The PIPE Investors include existing shareholders or affiliates of Gogoro or Sponsor and various strategic partners. On January 18, 2022, certain investors entered into additional share subscription agreements and committed to purchase Gogoro Ordinary Shares at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $27,500,000 (the “Additional PIPE Financing”). On March 21, 2022, Taishin Venture Capital Investment Co. entered into a share subscription agreement and committed to subscribe for and purchase 1,000,000 Gogoro Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000 (together with the Initial PIPE Financing and the Additional PIPE Financing, the “PIPE Financing”). Under the PIPE Agreements, the obligations of the parties to consummate the PIPE Financing are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, (i) the absence of a legal prohibition on consummating the PIPE Financing, (ii) all conditions precedent under the Merger Agreement having been satisfied or waived, (iii) the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and (iv) material compliance with covenants.
Certain Related Agreements

Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, Sponsor, among other things, also agreed not to transfer any Gogoro Ordinary Shares held by it immediately after the First Effective Time (other than the Sponsor Earn-In Shares) (such Gogoro Ordinary Shares, the “Sponsor Locked-Up Shares”) during a period of six months from and after the Closing Date, subject to customary exceptions.

Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution under Cayman Islands law. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where it has been approved by either (i) the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders entitled to vote and so voting at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given; or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Other than as described above, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two thirds of our shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders.
Our initial shareholders, who will collectively beneficially own 20% of our ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose.
Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:

● | If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes that were paid by us or are payable by us, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law;

● | Prior to or in connection with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on our initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions;

● | Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;

● | So long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination;

● | If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 8, 2023 or during any extended time in which we have to consummate a business combination or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will not effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001.
The Companies Act permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval of a special resolution, which requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of such company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting or by way of unanimous written resolution. A company’s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but, provided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provide otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend any of the provisions relating to our structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
We currently utilize office space at 101 Natoma St., 2F, San Francisco, CA 94105 as our executive offices. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have four executive officers: Emmanuel DeSousa, our Co-Chairman, Joaquin Rodriguez Torres, our Co-Chairman, Homer Sun, our Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Chan, our President. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
