Equity Exchange Agreement
 
As previously reported, on December 3, 2018, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (the “Company”), entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with IRA Financial Trust Company, a South Dakota trust corporation (“IRA Trust”), IRA Financial Group LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“IRAFG” and, together with IRA Trust, “IRA Financial”), and their respective equity holders (together, the “Equityholders”).

The Company, IRA Financial and the Equityholders subsequently amended the Exchange Agreement on three occasions to extend the outside date for consummation of the Exchange, with the last such extension expiring on July 3, 2019 (the “Outside Date”).

On August 4, 2019, IRAFG delivered to the Company notice of termination of the Exchange Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) thereof due to the failure of the Exchange to have closed on or prior to the Outside Date. No termination fees, penalties or other amounts are payable by the Company in respect of such termination.
