Overview
 Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) is a clinical stage and commercial biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering innovative and clinically meaningful therapies to address unmet medical needs. 
 At our core, we are antibody-centric and leverage our proprietary G-MAB™ library and targeted delivery modalities to generate the next generation of cancer therapeutics. Our fully human antibodies include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, CD123, CD47, CTLA-4, CD137 and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, among others. We also have programs assessing the use of our technologies and products in autoimmune, inflammatory, viral and neurodegenerative diseases.
 Our vision is to leverage these antibodies in conjunction with proprietary targeted delivery modalities to generate the next generation of cancer therapeutics. These modalities include proprietary chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (“CAR-T”), dimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (“DAR-T”), antibody drug conjugates (“ADCs”) as well as bispecific antibody approaches. We acquired Sofusa®, a revolutionary drug delivery technology, in July 2018, which delivers biologics directly into the lymphatic system to potentially achieve improved efficacy and fewer adverse effects than standard parenteral immunotherapy. Additionally, our majority-owned subsidiary, Scilex Holding Company (“Scilex Holding”), acquired the assets of Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Semnur”) in March 2019. Semnur’s SEMDEXATM (“SP-102”) compound has the potential to become the first Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved epidural steroid product for the treatment of sciatica. In response to the global SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”) pandemic, we are utilizing the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (“BTK”) inhibitor (in-licensed from ACEA Therapeutics, Inc.) in a U.S. Phase II study of cytokine storm associated with a COVID-19 infection and in a Phase II trial in Brazil in mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, and we are also internally developing potential coronavirus antiviral therapies and vaccines, including ACE-MABTM, COVIDTRAPTM, COVI-MABTM, COVI-GUARDTM, COVI- SHIELDTM , COVI-AMG™ and T-VIVA-19TM; and diagnostic test solutions, including COVI-TRACK™, COVI-STIX™ and COVI-TRACE™.
 With each of our clinical and pre-clinical programs, we aim to tailor our therapies to treat specific stages in the evolution of a disease, from elimination, to equilibrium and escape. In addition, our objective is to focus on tumors that are resistant to current treatments and where we can design focused trials based on a genetic signature or biomarker to ensure patients have the best chance of a durable and significant response. We have several immuno-oncology programs that are in or near to entering the clinic. These include cellular therapies, oncolytic viruses (SeprehvecTM) and a palliative care program targeted to treat intractable cancer pain. Our cellular therapy programs focus on CAR-T and DAR-T for adoptive cellular immunotherapy to treat both solid and liquid tumors.
 From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our mission has been to leverage our deep expertise in developing targeted antibodies for cancer immunotherapy to create best-in-category treatments and diagnostics to ease suffering and assist in the global response to COVID-19. We have leveraged, and continue to leverage, our G-MAB library and antibody development engineering capabilities to advance a number of promising diagnostics and neutralizing antibody candidates to test and treat COVID-19 and the immune reactions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 Our first generation SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody was STI-1499 (COVI-GUARD™), which was engineered to prevent antibody dependent enhancement. This antibody was then optimized to produce the highly potent STI-2020, which is currently being developed in two outpatient formations: COVI-AMG (IV-push injection) and COVI-DROPS (nasal). COVI-AMG has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for a Phase I study of healthy volunteers, a Phase II study in outpatients with COVID-19 and a Phase II study in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe COVID-19, and we are awaiting FDA clearance for a Phase I study of COVI-DROPS of healthy volunteers and patients with mild COVID-19. Sorrento also has developed two promising potential rescue treatments with Abivertinib, an oral next generation dual EGFR/BTK inhibitor, to treat moderate to severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients and COVI-MSC™, a human allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells for patients suffering from COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress (ARD). Both have been cleared by the FDA and are in Phase Ib clinical studies. We are also working with Brazilian regulators (“ANVISA”) to conduct a COVID-19 study with Abivertinib and potentially with COVI-AMG TM. In pre-clinical development, we are rapidly screening new neutralizing antibodies to address the multiple emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 to potentially add to STI-2020 in a cocktail (COVI-SHIELD™) and exploring novel mechanistic approaches such as soluble recombinant fusion protein traps (COVIDTRAPTM) to potentially inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein with host ACE2 receptors, thereby potentially preventing viral cell entry.
 In furtherance of our goal to develop products across the entire continuum of COVID-19 solutions, we are further developing a number of highly sensitive and rapid diagnostic tests. COVI-STIX™ is a lateral flow antigen test that uses a proprietary platinum-based colloid and antibody combination, resulting in high sensitivity and accuracy. This is a simple and rapid (15-minute) test with a shallow nasal swab and is designed for point-of-care and at-home use. COVI-TRACK™ is a rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody 
 2

test kit intended for use initially in clinical laboratories and in point of care settings to quickly identify individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-infection or post- vaccination. COVI-TRACE™ was licensed from Columbia University as a rapid single step on-site colorimetric detection test for SARS-COV-2 genomic RNA from a saliva sample using targeted nucleic acid amplification for high throughput point-of-care situations.
 We have reported early data from Phase I trials of our carcinoembryonic antigen (“CEA”)-directed CAR-T program. We have treated five patients with stage 4, unresectable adenocarcinoma (four with pancreatic and one with colorectal cancer) and CEA-positive liver metastases with anti-CEA CAR-T. We successfully submitted an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for anti-CD38 CAR-T for the treatment of refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (“RRMM”), obtained clearance from the FDA and commenced a human clinical trial for this indication in early 2018. We have dosed eleven patients. We intend to close this study to further enrollment and start up a similar anti-CD38 CAR-T construct without the myc-tag (which cannot be used in Europe), and to continue treating RRMM patients in a Phase Ib/IIa study, which will begin enrollment in the first quarter of 2021. We filed INDs for our CD47 mAb and the first of our DAR-T platform product candidates in the first quarter of 2021.
 Broadly speaking, we believe we are one of the world’s leading CAR-T and DAR-T companies today due to our investments in technology and infrastructure, which have enabled significant progress in developing our next-generation non-viral, “off-the-shelf” allogeneic DAR-T solutions. With “off-the-shelf” solutions, DAR-T therapy can truly become a drug product platform rather than a treatment procedure.
 With respect to our ADC program, we began enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2021 in a Phase Ib ascending dose study of our CD38 ADC for systemic Amyloid light-chain (“AL”) amyloidosis. Based upon our recently announced exclusive license from Mayo Clinic for its antibody-drug-nanoparticle albumin-bound (“ADNAB”) platform, the next generation in ADC technology, we intend to file several INDs to treat various cancer targets.
 Outside of immuno-oncology programs, as part of our global aim to provide a wide range of therapeutic products to meet underserved markets, we have made investments in non-opioid pain management. These include resiniferatoxin (“RTX”), which is a non-opioid-based toxin that specifically targets transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (“TRPV1”) which, depending on the site of injection, can ablate, or destroy, nerves expressing TRPV1 or temporarily defunctionalize them. TRPV1 is responsible for the noxious chronic and inflammatory pain signaling that occurs post injury or trauma, but leaves other nerve functions intact. RTX has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of intractable pain with end-stage cancer and two Phase Ib trials (intrathecal and epidural routes) in that indication have or will soon be completed. A Phase Ib trial studying tolerance and efficacy of RTX for the control of moderate to severe osteoarthritis knee pain was initiated in late 2018 and intermediate results have shown efficacy with no dose limiting toxicities. The osteoarthritis trial enrolled the last patient in the first quarter of 2020, and we expect to release the final safety clinical data by the middle of 2021. We plan to start knee arthritis registrational trials after the completion of required preclinical studies.
 Also, in this area, we have developed in-house and acquired proprietary technologies to responsibly develop next generation, branded pharmaceutical products to better manage patients’ medical conditions, maximize the quality of life of patients and assist healthcare providers. The flagship product of our majority-owned subsidiary, Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Scilex Pharma”), ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%) (“ZTlido”), is a next-generation lidocaine delivery system, which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, a severe neuropathic pain condition in February 2018, and was commercially launched in October 2018. Scilex Pharma has now built a full commercial organization, which includes sales, marketing, market access and medical affairs. ZTlido has demonstrated superior adhesion in comparative head-to-head studies as compared to Lidoderm and is manufactured by our Japanese partner in their state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.
 Our Strategy
 Our primary goal is to leverage our fully human antibody development expertise to address significant unmet medical needs that can significantly improve a patient’s quality of life.  In the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we marshalled our resources to generate antibody-based treatments and diagnostic initiatives for COVID-19 in addition to acquiring other treatment assets to treat the entire spectrum of COVID-19 infections, from outpatients with mild infections, to hospitalized patients with moderate or severe infections.  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to make progress in our oncology programs and treatments for refractory chronic pain conditions, such as intractable pain due to advanced cancer or knee osteoarthritis.
 3

Our core strategic objectives and resources are:
 1. Using a deliberate process to optimize our lead product candidates to fill identified unmet needs and advance them rapidly into the clinic for initiation of Phase I studies.  Once demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, we plan to continue to drive through later phase (II and III) studies toward a new drug application (“NDA”) filing.  Early in this process, we evaluate each program for potential accelerated approval or breakthrough therapy designation to fast-track development.
 2. Collaborating with key opinion leaders and leading clinical and research institutes to enhance our clinical development plans and achieve our goals.  We currently have such agreements in place with the Mayo Clinic, Karolinska Institute, The Scripps Research Institute (“TSRI”), the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and Tufts Medical School, among others.
 3. Having active programs that utilize our antibodies in CAR-T, DAR-T, our antibody-drug conjugate platform (using our covalent linker technology), ADNAB platform, and our Sofusa® DoseConnect™ lymphatic delivery device to treat various oncology indications.  Additionally, we have active programs to treat the spectrum of COVID-19 infections with our highly potent neutralizing antibodies (“nAbs”) to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19 symptoms (IV COVI-AMG™ and intranasal COVI-DROPS™) and hospitalized patients with moderate infections (COVI-GUARD™), abivertinib (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase; BTK inhibitor) and mesenchymal stem cells to treat severe COVID-19 with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome. We are also planning to use our nAb, COVI-AMG™, paired with a DNA plasmid platform for intramuscular injection to induce one’s own body to generate nAbs to fight COVID-19.  Finally, we continue to progress resiniferatoxin, an ultrapotent TRPV-1 agonist, into Phase III for the treatment of intractable pain in advanced cancer and into a Phase II dose-ranging and proof-of-concept study in severe knee osteoarthritis.  Our subsidiary, Scilex Holding, is completing its Phase III epidural approach to the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy.
 4. Continuing, through our preclinical programs, to generate development candidates with exciting potential to meet unmet needs. We anticipate generating data to support more than a dozen new INDs in 2021.  These include moving our checkpoint inhibitors from our core antibody portfolio into the clinic with our strategic key opinion leaders and institutional partners. We will continue to develop our fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) portfolio for new ADCs and bispecific mAbs (“BsAbs”).  In addition, we expect to commence several clinical trials with the Sofusa® device to explore safety and efficacy features of this innovative drug delivery technology.
 5. Manufacturing our preclinical and clinical materials to support Phase I and II trials in-house. We have established quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure that our products are produced under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
 6. Continuing to explore strategic partnerships to share in the risk reward of our core franchises and to derive near term value from our non-core programs. Our partnering objectives include generating revenue through license fees, milestone-related development fees and royalties as well as profit shares or joint ventures to generate potential returns from our product candidates and technologies.
 Segment Information
 Effective January 1, 2019, we realigned our business into two new operating and reportable segments, Sorrento Therapeutics and Scilex. 
 Sorrento Therapeutics. The Sorrento Therapeutics segment is organized around our Immune-Oncology therapeutic area, leveraging our proprietary G-MAB™ antibody library and targeted delivery modalities to generate the next generation of cancer therapeutics. These modalities include proprietary CAR-T, DAR-T, ADCs as well as bispecific antibody approaches. Additionally, this segment also includes Sofusa®, a drug delivery technology that delivers biologics directly into the lymphatic system to potentially achieve improved efficacy and fewer adverse effects than standard parenteral immunotherapy, and RTX, which is a non-opioid-based neurotoxin currently in clinical trials for late stage cancer pain and moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee pain.
 Scilex. The Scilex segment is largely organized around our non-opioid pain management operations. Revenues from the Scilex segment are exclusively derived from the sale of ZTlido.

Clinical Programs
 G-MAB™: Fully Human Antibody Library Platform
 Our G-MAB™ library, which forms the backbone of many of our product candidates, was initially invented by Henry Ji, Ph.D., our co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe our proprietary G-MAB™ library is one of the industry’s largest and most diverse fully human antibody libraries, with an estimated one quadrillion unique antibodies available for drug discovery and development. We believe G-MAB™ may offer the following advantages over competing antibody libraries:

• | G-MAB™ has been designed to provide a full spectrum of human immunoglobulin gene recombination in fully-human mAbs. Unlike chimeric and humanization technologies, G-MAB™ has allowed the generation of antibodies with fully-human protein sequences without the challenges and limitations of animal-to-human gene transfer procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Because G-MAB™ represents an in vitro human mAb library technology, research suggests that it enables faster and cost-effective in vitro screening of a large number of antigens. G-MAB™ is designed so that any antigen of interest can be investigated, with no dependence on the successful induction of a host immune response against the antigen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following is a depiction of the types of fully human mAbs that we have derived from G-MAB™. It includes antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets, from small molecular weight antigens to large protein complexes antigens, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptors (“GPCRs”), a difficult class of antigens to raise therapeutics antibodies against.


Our objective is to leverage G-MAB™ to develop first in class or best in class antibody drug candidates that will possess greater efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to existing drugs and develop them as novel monotherapies, ADCs (such as c-MET), components of bispecific antibodies, and as part of our adoptive immunotherapy (CD38, BCMA), oncolytic virus program and intracellular targeting programs (STAT3, mutant KRAS).
 To date, we have screened over 100 validated targets and generated a number of fully human antibodies against these targets which are at various stages of development. These include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, BCMA, CTLA-4, CD123, CD47, c-MET, VEGFR2, CCR2 and CD137 among others. Upon the completion of preclinical studies, our objective is to, independently or in tandem with our strategic collaborators, file INDs for these product candidates.
 COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)
 COVID-19 is a new pandemic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA virus termed SARS-CoV-2.  Infection with COVID-19 may cause severe disease requiring hospitalization in up to a third of patients, with frequent progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) and a high mortality rate. A virus-induced hyperinflammatory response or “cytokine storm” has been hypothesized to be a major contributor to ARDS through modulation of pulmonary macrophages, dendritic cells and other immune cells.  Patients with COVID-19 may develop elevated blood levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and those who are admitted to intensive care have even higher levels of these cytokines, which may indicate a far worse outcome.
 We have leveraged our expertise in producing fully-human monoclonal antibodies and our extensive G-MAB™ antibody library to develop potent neutralizing antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.  In addition, we have acquired assets that target the entire spectrum of COVID-19 infections, from outpatients who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms to hospitalized patients with moderate symptoms to patients with severe or critical COVID-19 in intensive care units.  Paired with our highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for COVID-19, we have developed the ability to diagnose early and treat every stage of this pandemic infection.

STI-2020 (COVI-AMG™) is the affinity-matured neutralizing antibody developed from STI-1499 (COVI-GUARD) which has been shown in vitro to be effective against the original Wuhan, China COVID-19 strain and emerging strains, D614G and N439K.  STI-2020, formulated for intravenous administration, blocks viral interactions with the ACE-2 receptor to prevent cell entry and replication and was engineered to lack any antibody-dependent enhancement (“ADE”) and tissue cross-reactivity (including possible hypersensitivity) neither of which has been observed in in vitro or in vivo preclinical studies.  In the Syrian Golden hamster model, intravenous STI-2020 rapidly reverses COVID-19 infection and clears viral particles from lung tissues.  After a successful IND submission, intravenous STI-2020 (administered as a slow intravenous push, not as an infusion) is currently in the clinic enrolling a healthy subject study to obtain initial safety and pharmacokinetic data before the intended studies in outpatients with mild COVID-19 infections in the United States, Brazil and Mexico.
 STI-2099 (COVI-DROPS™) is STI-2020 formulated for intranasal delivery.  The neutralizing potency of STI-2020 lends itself to intranasal delivery, which may be an effective way of rapidly reducing infectivity and clearing viral burden from the nasopharynx and lung airways.  STI-2099 may be a preferred treatment for children who may not be willing to receive an injection. With IND clearance expected in the first quarter of 2021, we plan on conducting healthy subject studies comparing intranasal STI-2099 alone or in combination with intravenous STI-2020 for an “outside/inside” approach to reduce infectivity and treat the systemic infection in late first quarter of 2021.  This first study will be conducted as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the Dahms Clinical Research Unit at the University Hospitals, Case Western University.  After verifying safety, we expect to rapidly move into a Phase Ib study and Phase II studies enrolling outpatients who are asymptomatic or have mild COVID-19 symptoms and using intranasal STI-2099 alone or in combination with intravenous STI-2020.  Studies are planned for the United States, Brazil and Mexico.
 STI-5656 (abivertinib maleate) is a potent, small molecule third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) of epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) and, importantly, also a BTK receptor.  It inhibits the gatekeeper mutation of EGFR; T790M, as well as the common activating mutations (L858R, 19del), and has minimal inhibitory activity against the wild type (“WT”) receptor, contributing to its observed safety.  Additionally, STI-5656 irreversibly binds to the BTK receptor at nanomolar potency, preventing the phosphorylation of the receptor and has shown potent immunomodulatory activities by inhibiting key pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, all of which are correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in ARDS and “cytokine storm” due to COVID-19 infections.  STI-5656 is currently enrolling subjects in a Phase II study of intensive care unit subjects with severe or critical COVID-19 in the United States.  We also are starting up a larger Phase II study in Brazil.  
 STI-8282 Mesenchymal Stem Cells: After acquiring an allogeneic culture-expanded adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (“MSC”) asset from Personalized Stem Cells, we transitioned the open IND and are currently enrolling a Phase Ib study of subjects with severe COVID-19 infections complicated by impending ARDS who will each receive three infusions of STI-8282 MSCs in hopes of preventing the pulmonary fibrosis, edema, inflammation and other comorbid processes accompanying respiratory failure.  This study is enrolling at a single California site, but will be expanded to other sites in the United States and Brazil.
 STI-8472 (COVI-GeneMAb™): Finally, while not directly a “treatment” for COVID-19, the acquisition of SmartPharm Therapeutics, Inc. in September 2020 gave us the ability to use non-viral DNA and RNA gene delivery platforms to create a gene-encoded therapeutic product candidate using our STI-2020 neutralizing antibody.  With this combination, an intramuscular injection can cause the person’s own body to produce the neutralizing antibody for possibly months instead of having to rely on intermittent injections of externally manufactured antibodies, such as STI-2020.  STI-8472 (COVI-GeneMAb™) is the combination of the non-viral DNA plasmid with gene-encoded STI-2020.  We are in the process of completing the IND-enabling preclinical and chemistry, manufacturing and controls steps necessary to file an IND in the first quarter of 2021. We envision a combination of an STI-2020 injection to “treat” and STI-8472 to “prevent” reinfection in those positive for COVID-19 or in subjects negative for COVID-19, along with STI-8472 to prevent infection. This may be a valuable option for those who refuse to be vaccinated for health or other reasons.  This program received approved funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”), an advanced-technology branch of the U.S. Department of Defense.
 Anti-CD38 CAR-T Program 
 Chimeric antigen receptors (“CARs”) have been created for commercial and clinical development programs.  The architecture of the CAR consists of a single fusion protein with several functional components: a single-chain variable fragment (“scFv”) derived from an anti-tumor antibody fused to a structural support segment, a transmembrane portion, and one or more intracellular signaling domains.  Potential drawbacks of the CAR technology are the use of scFv that often possess inferior biophysical stability and biochemical functionality compared to their parental antibodies.
 The membrane glycoprotein CD38 is widely found on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid lineages including B, T and NK cells, but absent from most mature resting lymphocytes with the notable exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells. Because CD38 is highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells, it represents a valuable and validated therapeutic target against myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy in which clonal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow or extramedullary sites 
 6

and give rise to clinical complications such as painful, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, cytopenias, and symptomatic plasmacytomas.
 STI-2798 and STI-5171 (anti-CD38 CAR-T): Our proprietary, second generation anti-CD38 CAR-T therapy is being developed for the treatment of RRMM.  Our anti-CD38 CAR-T is based on a fully human anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody derived from our G-MAB™ antibody library.  We recently completed a Phase Ib ascending dose safety study of STI-5171 which began in 2018 with the initial anti-CD38 CAR-T platform.  While long-term follow up is continuing, in the last two dose cohorts (106 or 107 cells/kg body weight), we achieved a 50% overall response rate.  We improved on the CAR-T construct by removing the “myc tag” (which cannot be used in Europe) CAR-T product candidate (STI-2798) and made changes to the lymphodepletion protocol in hopes of improving long-term cell persistence.  After a successful IND submission for STI-2798, our new anti-CD38 CAR-T (-myc), we are activating sites and will continue to enroll subjects with RRMM in the coming year.  
 Anti-CD38 KOKI DAR-T Program
 We are addressing the potential weaknesses of CAR constructs while building on the clinical experience generated within our current CAR-T programs with the design of dimeric antigen receptors (“DARs”) based on the complete antigen-binding fragment (“Fab”) of the parental antibody.  It is generally accepted that Fabs more closely mimic the functional and biophysical properties of natural antibodies.  Utilizing the same antibody binding domain sequence, we have compared CAR constructs with a scFv binding domain to a DAR construct with a Fab or two chain binding domain.  Our data showed that the DAR-T cells exhibited a higher functional activity with regards to cytokine production, and cytotoxicity against target-expressing tumor cells compared to CAR-T cells. In preclinical mouse models, the DAR-T cells demonstrated increased anti-tumor potency as well.  We are currently applying our DAR technology to our ongoing cell therapy programs for multiple hematological and solid tumor indications, including but not limited to multiple myeloma, lymphoma, liver cancer, sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and glioma.
 STI-1492, an allogeneic non-viral anti-CD38 A2 KOKI DAR-T cell agent (second generation anti-CD38 “knock-out knock-in” dimeric antigen receptor 4-1BBζ - engineered T cells), is completing FDA-required steps before beginning our clinical enrollment.  STI-1492 consists of allogeneic donor T cells that are engineered to express an anti-CD38 antigen receptor for the treatment of patients with RRMM.  The DAR consists of a fragment antigen-binding variable region (Fab) instead of the scFv utilized by CARs. During the production of STI-1492, there is a “knock-in” of the DAR into the T-cell receptor (“TCR”) alpha constant region (“TRAC”) gene. The TCR alpha is simultaneously inactivated (“knock-out”) by this DAR knock-in process, allowing allogeneic T cells to be administered therapeutically without the development of graft versus host disease.  The anti-CD38 A2 DAR vector is integrated into the TCR locus by CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing methods instead of by a lentivirus/retrovirus.  In addition, STI-1492 utilizes a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain. The anti-CD38 DAR design is associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity, longer persistence and possibly less toxicity compared with the anti-CD38 CAR design in preclinical studies.  The ability to administer this agent as modified allogeneic T cells allows STI-1492 to be stored as an off-the-shelf agent that eliminates the need for leukapheresis and the treatment delay for the manufacturing process for each individual patient associated with autologous cellular therapy.
 Our KOKI technology may offer several potential benefits over existing virus-based technology using transgene-encoding lentivirus, retrovirus or adeno-associated virus to introduce antigen receptor constructs into healthy donor (allogeneic) or cancer patient (autologous) T cells.  These potential advantages of our non-viral KOKI technology include: 
  
• | site-specific integration of transgenes into a pre-selected locus in the T cell genome
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | streamlined method for transgene construct production without need for laborious and time-consuming virus production, release and validation processes, resulting in a shorter research and development timelines for IND-enabling activities and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | applicability to both autologous and allogeneic cellular therapies
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to use our G- MAB™ library to generate a number of monoclonal antibodies that can be used with our KOKI DAR-T platform to target a number of difficult to treat cancers.
 Anti-CD38 Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Program 
 AL amyloidosis is an incurable disease that is characterized by a clonal population of bone marrow plasma cells that produces a monoclonal light chain immunoglobulin.  The clonal plasma cells often make up less than 10% of the nucleated cells in the bone marrow in patients with AL amyloidosis.  The light chain immunoglobulin is of a ĸ or λ type and is produced as either an intact molecule or a fragment.  The light chain protein produced by the dysfunctional plasma cells associated with AL amyloidosis is misfolded, forming β-pleated sheets that deposit in tissues in the form of amyloid fibrils.  The insoluble tissue protein deposits interfere with organ function and the soluble circulating light chains may be toxic to organs as well.  The clinical features of AL amyloidosis depend on which organs are involved and may include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic dysfunction, peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy and signs or symptoms of an atypical multiple myeloma.

STI-6129 ADC is composed of a human monoclonal anti-CD38 A2 antibody (STI-5171) covalently bound by a chemical linker to a dolastatin tubulin inhibitor chemotherapeutic derivative (duostatin 5.2).  STI-5171 was generated from Sorrento’s proprietary antibody library. The binding affinity of STI-5171 to CD38 is comparable to that of daratumumab (Sorrento data on file). The STI-6129 ADC is produced by conjugation of the drug-linker-duostatin moiety to the parent STI-5171 monoclonal antibody.  The heavy chain of the STI-5171 parent antibody included in the STI-6129 ADC has been modified by a C246→S mutation that substitutes a serine amino acid for cysteine. This substitution results in an antibody with 3 inter-chain disulfide bonds instead of the 4 disulfide bonds present in wild type IgG1 antibodies and provides an ADC with drug to antibody ratio of 3 (Sorrento data on file). Upon binding to CD38 target cell surface antigen, the STI-6129 ADC is internalized by the cell and undergoes lysosomal degradation resulting in the release of the duostatin 5.2 chemotherapeutic agent.  This targeted delivery of potent chemotherapeutic agents is designed to enhance activity against the aberrant plasma cells in AL amyloidosis, minimize toxicity in normal tissues, and provide sustained delivery of the chemotherapy over time.  The proprietary covalent linker technology reduces premature release of the duostatin which may reduce ocular toxicity and other adverse events.  After a successful IND submission, STI-6129 is currently enrolling patients in an ascending dose study to identify the maximum tolerated dose to be used for the treatment of AL amyloidosis.  Once a recommended Phase II dose is identified, an expansion cohort will be enrolled.  Additionally, we are partnering with Columbia University in New York City to assess STI-6129 in the treatment of RRMM.
 Anti-CD47 Fully Human Monoclonal Antibody Program (STI-6643)
 Several studies have described the role of cluster of differentiation 47/Signal regulatory protein-alpha (“CD47/SIRPα”) interaction in regulating macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and dendritic cell-mediated cross-priming of T cells.  CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed immuno-regulatory glycoprotein (also known as integrin-associated protein) of the immunoglobulin superfamily best known for its so called ‘don’t eat me’ function that prevents phagocytic removal of healthy cells by the body’s immune system.  Many cancers present high levels of this signal on their cell surface, thereby disrupting anti-cancer immune responses.  Given CD47’s essential role as a negative checkpoint for innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity, the CD47-SIRPα axis has been explored as a new target for cancer immunotherapy and its disruption has demonstrated great therapeutic promise in reestablishing antitumor activity in vivo.  However, significant anemia and thrombocytopenia has plagued early product candidates (e.g., Hu5F9-G4 or magrolimab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody) due to CD47 expression on normal cells, particularly aging red blood cells which may lose this ‘marker of self’ becoming susceptible to clearance by splenic macrophages.  This major ‘on-target’ dose limiting toxicity was seen with magrolimab in preclinical studies and required complicated priming methodologies to reduce this risk.
 STI-6643 is our novel fully human CD47 monoclonal antibody that blocks CD47/SIRPα to promote in vitro anti-tumor phagocytic activity.  When incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, STI-6643 demonstrated minimal T, B or NK cell depletion as opposed to reference clones (prepared based on sequence analysis) which could result in improved efficacy by preserving the infiltrating anti-tumor immune cells.  Additionally, STI-6643 showed 15- to 30-fold reduction in observed hemagglutination in human and cynomolgus monkey red blood cells, respectively, and despite its high binding to canine red blood cells, it showed reduced hemagglutination in comparison to magrolimab (clone prepared based on the sequence analysis).  An IND submission is pending clearance for STI-6643 in the treatment of a variety of advanced cancers. We hope to begin enrollment in the first quarter of 2021.
Antibody-Drug Nanoparticle Albumin Bound (ADNAB) Platform 
 We are currently involved in a partnership with Mayo Clinic Rochester, with Dr. Svetomir Markovic, to use the nanoparticle human serum albumin bound paclitaxel (or other chemotherapeutic agents) platform to bind various monoclonal antibodies to the external surface of the albumin micelles to form stable complexes that can be designed to target specific cancers for delivery directly to the tumor microenvironment.  This partnership would leverage our existing antibody library, including PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, BCMA, CTLA-4, CD123, CD47, c-MET, VEGFR2, CCR2 and CD137, among others, to create ADNAB products that may enhance tumor response.  The first programs (B cell lymphomas, melanoma and gynecological cancers) are already ongoing under an investigator-initiated IND that we will support moving forward and when initial proof of concept is available, we intend to transfer the IND and offer the product candidate to other sites around the country.
Sofusa® Lymphatic Delivery System (S-LDS)
 Sofusa is a novel technology platform designed for targeted drug delivery to lymphatics vessels and lymph nodes.  Abnormal immune system function is implicated in many conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis and Psoriasis).  Sofusa’s proprietary nanotopography draped microneedles have been shown to reversibly open tight junctions in the skin and facilitate paracellular and transcellular transport across the epidermis.  In pre-clinical biodistribution studies, this proprietary microneedle and microfluidics system has consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver over 40-fold in drug concentration to lymph nodes (with lower drug concentration in systemic organs) when compared to traditional intravenous (“IV”) and subcutaneous (“SC”) injections. After a 1-hour administration with Sofusa, elevated lymph node concentrations are sustained 
 8

beyond 36 hours. Multiple pharmacodynamic models confirm that increased exposure to drug targets in the lymphatics has potential to improve clinical response, potentially at significantly lower doses vs IV or SC administration.
 Phase I clinical safety studies have now been completed for a large molecule (etanercept) and for a small molecule (sumatriptan).  We have filed two INDs and are authorized to proceed with our first human efficacy studies with an anti-TNFα in Rheumatoid Arthritis and with a checkpoint inhibitor in oncology. This checkpoint study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a Sofusa anti-PD1 antibody in patients with Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma. In this pilot study, we will evaluate the feasibility of Sofusa delivery in patients with skin cancers accessible to biopsies for intensive biomarker assessments. These trials will help assess whether the principles of better efficacy and safety seen in lymphatic administration of drugs in animal models can be replicated in patients. If the Sofusa Lymphatic Delivery System is successful in the clinic, the commercial Sofusa® DoseDisc™ wearable device may offer not only the potential for both improved clinical response, but also a more convenient dosing alternative to traditional SC injections or IV infusions for patients.
 Based upon the Sofusa core microneedle technology, we have also developed the Sofusa MuVaxx™ device for the administration of small volume peptides and vaccines.  The skin (rich in dendritic cells) and lymph nodes are the primary organs for generating both humoral immunity (IgG and IgM) and cellular immunity (memory T-Cells) for long-term protection.  In a pre-clinical COVID-19 vaccine study, the Sofusa device resulted in 10-40X higher T-Cell response versus IM and intradermal injections.  The Sofusa MuVaxx device is designed to be a simple low-cost attachment to a standard syringe for rapid large-scale deployment of our vaccine candidates.
 Oncolytic Virus Program (Seprehvir® and Seprehvec®)
 We previously completed two trials using Herpes simplex virus lacking infected cell protein 34.5 (“HSV1716”) or Seprehvir to treat solid pediatric or young adult non-central nervous system tumors or malignant pleural mesothelioma with intratumoral, intravenous of intrapleural administration.  A second-generation product, Seprehvec, is a platform that can generate a number of possible product candidates and the first, STI-1386, is gearing up for an IND submission early in 2021 with targeted cancers still to be finalized.
Resiniferatoxin (“RTX”) Programs
 RTX is a naturally occurring compound obtained from cactus-like succulents of the Euphorbia species. An ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist, RTX belongs to the same general TRPV1 family as capsaicin, the active ingredient in red chili peppers. As an agonist, RTX produces a sustained opening of calcium channels expressed on neurons, either in the end-terminals or cell bodies, of C-fibers or A-delta fibers.  The effect from this sustained calcium influx depends on the location that RTX is injected.  When injected peripherally near end-terminals (for example intra-articularly), a sustained defunctionalization or desensitization occurs resulting in reduction in noxious chronic pain symptoms that can last for months.  When injected neuraxially (intrathecally or epidurally) rapid programmed cell death of TRPV1-expressing neurons targeted by the RTX injection can produce long-lasting improvement in noxious chronic pain that has been refractory to treatment (e.g., cancer related pain). RTX does not interact with and leaves unaffected non-TRPV1-expressing nerves (touch, motor control and position sense).
 An investigator-sponsored Phase I clinical trial of intrathecal RTX has been ongoing at the NIH under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. To date, 14 patients with terminal cancer pain have been treated intrathecally at the NIH. 
 A Phase Ib clinical trial with epidural RTX was completed in 2020 in 17 subjects with intractable pain due to advanced cancer. No dose limiting toxicity was observed at doses up to 25 mcg RTX and RTX demonstrated promising efficacy in relieving intractable pain associated with advanced cancer.  A Phase II/III study was submitted to the IND in December 2020 and will begin enrolling early in 2021.
 Another Phase Ib clinical trial with intra-articular RTX administration for moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee was completed with no dose limiting toxicities at any of the administered doses. 94 patients were enrolled at RTX doses from 5 mcg to 25 mcg; 40 subjects enrolled in the placebo-controlled ascending dose portion of the study, 38 subjects received 12.5 mcg and 16 subjects received 25 mcg.  The preliminary efficacy results in this study show promising evidence of a significant improvement lasting well beyond 6 months.  These preliminary results will need to be documented in a Phase II proof-of-concept study comparing several RTX doses against placebo, which is planned for early 2021.

Scilex Holding
 Scilex Holding is focused on cost-effectively developing and commercializing non-opioid therapies that will provide safe and substantial, localized pain relief for large market opportunities. The following chart illustrates the current product and product candidates for which Scilex Holding has worldwide commercialization rights, except with respect to Japan for ZTlido and SP-103:

ZTlido
 ZTlido is a lidocaine topical system approved for the relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia (“PHN”). PHN is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome that results as a complication following an infection of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Herpes zoster symptoms typically resolve after a few weeks, but the pain caused by the nerve injury can persist for months to years in the affected area. ZTlido is designed as a lighter, thinner product which has improved adhesion relative to Lidoderm (lidocaine patch 5%), while providing a bioequivalent delivery of lidocaine in an efficient drug delivery system. 
 We launched ZTlido in October 2018 with support from an integrated commercial organization using a dedicated contract sales force and our own sales management, marketing and managed care capabilities. We market ZTlido through a dedicated sales force of 60 individuals, targeting approximately 10,000 primary care physicians, pain specialists, neurologists and palliative care physicians. We are utilizing a multi-channel marketing strategy to expand awareness and utilization of ZTlido.
 SEMDEXA 
 SEMDEXA is a Phase III product candidate we are developing to be an injectable viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid designed to address the serious risks posed by off-label epidural steroid injections, or ESIs, for the treatment of sciatica, a pathology of low back pain. We believe SEMDEXA, if successfully developed, has the potential to reduce the disability related to sciatica and help delay or avoid spine surgery. SEMDEXA has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and, if approved, could become the only FDA-approved alternative to off-label ESIs, which are administered over 10 million times annually in the United States. We are currently evaluating SEMDEXA in a pivotal Phase III Corticosteroid Lumbar Epidural Analgesia for Radiculopathy trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in the proposed indication. We expect top-line results from the study in the second half of 2021, and if results are positive, we intend to submit a request to the FDA for breakthrough designation.
 SP-103
 SP-103 is an investigational, non-aqueous lidocaine topical system undergoing clinical development in low back pain conditions. SP-103 builds on the learnings from ZTlido because both products share a similar adhesive drug delivery formulation and manufacturing technology. If approved, we believe that SP-103 could become the first-in-class lidocaine topical product for low back pain indications. All current uses of topical lidocaine products for low back pain are off-label. SP-103 has three times the drug load of ZTlido (108 mg versus 36 mg) in the adhesive system to potentially deliver threefold level of the drug within a targeted area, still with the convenience of a single topical system. Additionally, SP-103 is designed to deliver a localized dose of lidocaine that is threefold greater than any lidocaine topical product that we are aware of either on the market or in development. If approved, we believe SP-103 may be able to address the limitations of prescription lidocaine patches in treating low back pain by delivering a higher dose of lidocaine to the application site. We expect the Phase II trial to commence in the second half of 2021.
 Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
 We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents, is effectively maintained as a trade secret, or is protected by confidentiality agreements. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business.

 Certain factors can either extend patent terms or provide other forms of exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity) for varying periods depending on the date of patent filing, date of grant or the legal term of a patent in the various jurisdictions in which patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, also depends upon the type of patent, the scope of claim coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the particular country.
 12

While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interest in any intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and, if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
 In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a strong emphasis on proprietary products and intellectual property. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, some or all of which may have greater access to capital or resources than we do. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, we will have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We expect that the market will become increasingly competitive in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs, and have substantially greater commercial and financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in: developing product candidates and technologies, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates, formulating and manufacturing product candidates and launching, marketing and selling product candidates. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products.
 Immunotherapy
 Immunotherapy is an active area of research and several immune-related products have been identified in recent years that modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T-cell activation. More recently, bispecific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors (for instance PD‑1/PD-L1 antibodies) have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the TCR, thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors on the other hand, work by targeting receptors that inhibit T-cell effectiveness and proliferation and thereby essentially activate T cells. Other immunotherapies that are being actively investigated include: antibody drug complexes, TCR-mimic antibodies, oncolytic viruses, cancer vaccines. 
 We are aware of companies developing therapies in various areas related to our specific research and development programs. Specifically, there are a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions researching and developing autologous and allogeneic CAR-T therapies in both the solid and liquid tumor setting. These CAR-T cell therapies are at a variety of stages of preclinical, clinical development and approval. Such therapies are directed towards a broad target spectrum, including but not limited to: DLL3, EGFR, GD2, HER-2, IL13rα2, Lewis Y, L1-CAM, Mesothelin, MUC16, PSCA, PSMA and ROR1. The two approved CAR-T therapies both target CD19.
 RTX
 The pain management field in particular is a growing industry due to increased attention on opioid usage for pain, which has created a rapidly emerging market and has fueled an increased interest in opioid alternatives. The rise of various small and early-stage companies in the non-opioid pain management field may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.

COVID-19 Product Candidates
Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs): Sorrento has several nAbs either in development or in the clinic.  These nAbs are directed against the COVID-19 spike protein.  The lead nAb, STI-2020, has been shown to be effective in preclinical studies against various escape mutations (D614G, N439K, and B117 variants) as part of Sorrento’s ongoing surveillance program.  Two companies (Regeneron and Lilly) have obtained EUA clearance for their nAbs (Regeneron’s casirivimab/imdevimab cocktail and Lilly’s bamlanivimab). There are several other companies which have nAbs in early development. In addition, companies which are involved in vaccine development are indirect competitors in this space, although the vaccines known to be in development are not nAbs-based. 
 Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (BTKI): Sorrento currently is in mid-Phase 2 trials for abivertinib, its dual EGFR/BTKI, to treat acute respiratory distress due (ARD) to COVID-19. There are several other BTKIs approved for oncology conditions that could theoretically be used to treat COVID-19-induced ARD.  Acalabrutinib (Calquence™) was used in two Phase 2 studies but failed to meet its primary endpoint.
 Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs): We are currently enrolling a Phase 1b study treating COVID-19-induced ARD and ARD syndrome (ARDS). There are a large number of companies and universities exploring various MSCs (adipose, bone marrow, cord blood, umbilical and other sources) in Phase 1 and 2 studies to treat moderate to severe COVID-19.
 Scilex
 ZTlido and our product candidate, SP-103, if approved, face and will likely face competition from prescription and generic topical lidocaine patches, including Lidoderm and generic lidocaine patches manufactured by Teva, Mylan and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. Additionally, SP-103, if approved, will likely compete with various opioid pain medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”), muscle relaxants, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, particularly as we seek approval for the treatment of chronic low back pain.
 SEMDEXA, if approved, has the potential to become the first FDA-approved epidural steroid product for the treatment of sciatica. While there are currently no FDA approved ESIs indicated for the treatment of sciatica, we are aware of certain non-steroid product candidates in development. For example, Sollis Therapeutics, Inc. is developing its product candidate, a non-opioid, non-steroid clonidine micropellet to be administered through epidural injection, which is currently in Phase III development. SEMDEXA, if approved, will compete with various opioid pain medications, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and surgical procedures. Procedures may include nerve blocks and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations. We may also face indirect competition from the off-label and unapproved use of branded and generic injectable steroids. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of ZTlido, SEMDEXA and SP-103 are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Government Regulations
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or a NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or an NDA to file the BLA or NDA for review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more of the clinical sites at which the clinical trials were conducted;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at the discretion of the FDA, a public Advisory Committee Meeting where the data is reviewed by experts who discuss the data and give their opinion (which the FDA is not obliged to follow) of the adequacy of the data to support an approval; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA or an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, import and export of materials and products, environmental protection and the use and handling of hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemical compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 The pre-approval clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases (the numbers of subjects/patients are approximate and vary from indication to indication). Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
  
• | Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15

 
• | Phase II. Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In general, two Phase III trials are needed for an approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are also Phase III trials but may be Phase II trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 Once the BLA or NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
 During the evaluation of the BLA or NDA, the FDA conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced and some of the clinical sites that conducted the trials, and it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
 After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved BLA or NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions 
 16

and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically (about every two years) inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production, distribution, shipping and storage of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 Europe/Rest of World Government Regulations
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Available Special Regulatory Procedures
 Formal Meetings
 We can engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the U.S., there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. Meetings with the FDA are free.
 The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting.
 17

Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on specific questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials and pharmaco-vigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from health authorities in the U.S. and the European Union, Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) or Protocol Assistance procedures are available. An SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA’s agreement to an SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical trials begin, or if the trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a trial will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the trial is subject to an SPA.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.  
 In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Authorization Procedures in the European Union
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
  
• | Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Accelerated Review (European Union)
 Based on results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA or NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the BLA or NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the BLA or NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
 There can be no assurance that we or any of our partners would be able to satisfy one or more of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Healthcare Reform Law”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law established:
  
• | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19

We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Healthcare Reform Law, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $11,463 to $22,927 (each subject to adjustment for inflation) for each separate false claim.
 Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.

Antibody Clinical Development
 We currently focus our research efforts primarily in the identification and isolation of human antibody drug candidates and further characterize these antibody candidates in in vitro and in vivo functional testing. Due to our limited financial resources, we intend to actively seek product development and commercialization partners from the biopharmaceutical industry to help us advance the clinical development of select product candidates.
Marketing and Sales
 With the exception of our subsidiary, Scilex Holding, we currently do not have any sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses or use the services of contract sales organizations (“CROs”), which are equipped to, market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing and sales teams and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 We currently manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. As of December 31, 2020, our ZTlido product is manufactured by ITOCHU CHEMICAL FRONTIER Corporation. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in our markets require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMPs. We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 502 employees and 29 consultants and advisors. A significant number of our management and our other employees and consultants have worked or consulted with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future.
 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We focus on identifying, recruiting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, as well providing our employees with the opportunity to participate in our employee stock purchase plan, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being, health and safety of our employees. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive action from the earliest signs of the COVID-19 outbreak, which included implementing social distancing policies at our facilities, facilitating remote working arrangements and imposing employee travel restrictions.
 Corporate Information
 On September 21, 2009, QuikByte Software, Inc., a Colorado corporation and shell company (“QuikByte”), consummated its acquisition of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation and private concern (“STI”), in a reverse merger (the “Merger”).
 We were originally incorporated as San Diego Antibody Company in California in 2006 and were renamed “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.” and reincorporated in Delaware in 2009, prior to the Merger. QuikByte was originally incorporated in Colorado in 1989. Following the Merger, on December 4, 2009, QuikByte reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”). Immediately following the Reincorporation, on December 4, 2009, we merged with and into QuikByte, the separate corporate existence of STI ceased and QuikByte continued as the surviving corporation (the “Roll-Up Merger”). Pursuant to the certificate of merger filed in connection with the Roll-Up Merger, QuikByte’s name was changed from “QuikByte Software, Inc.” to “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.”
