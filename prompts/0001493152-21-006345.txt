Item 1. Business 
Business Overview 


We are an organic and healthy products company intending to become the world’s leading social selling and distribution company. We are a purpose-driven firm dedicated to providing healthy products to customers and inspiring them to “Live Healthy.” We commercialize our portfolio of products across more than 50 countries worldwide and strive to disrupt traditional markets with industry leading social selling tools and technologies. More than 75% of our revenue is ordered and fulfilled online with the products delivered direct to customers’ homes.
 We compete in three major category platforms including health and wellness, healthy appearance, and nutritional performance. Within our category platforms, we develop and market a portfolio of science-based, functionally differentiated, and superior performing products and brands. We differentiate our products utilizing our patents, proprietary formulas and production process, and trade secrets and focus our functional differentiation using different combinations of:
 

● | Phytonutrients and micronutrients 
--+--------------------------------------
● | Plant-based ingredients 
● | CBD 
● | Noni 
● | Clean/non-toxic ingredients 



Tahitian Noni is our largest brand and has accounted for more than $7.0 billion in sales since its inception, including approximately $360 million cumulatively recognized by us since our acquisition of Morinda in December 2018. There are multiple studies and human trials validating Tahitian Noni’s efficacy and benefits for reducing inflammation and strengthening the body’s protection against viruses. Also, within the health and wellness platform is our LIMU brand, a fucoidan-rich beverage sourced from seaweed. We have two core brands within the healthy appearance platform including TeMana, a unique skin care portfolio that is infused with Tahitian Noni, and Lucim, a line of clean skin care products that was launched in 2020. In our nutritional performance platform, we commercialize a full line of weight management products and other nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals and are expanding our core brands within the platform.
 We believe that a major trend in consumer goods is direct delivery, e-commerce ordering, and fulfillment, with purchase intent being driven by social media and friends and family. According to Euromonitor International’s 2019 Lifestyles Survey, the largest driver of purchase intent in every major region of the world was friends and family recommendations and related social media posts. We further believe that these fundamental trends limit the historic advantage of traditional manufacturers geared toward sale of their products, using traditional media, merchandized in traditional retail outlets.
 We believe one of our competitive advantages is our network of more than 400,000 brand partners (“Brand Partners”) around the world, and our own direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) delivery system that provides near captive distribution in our respective market areas. We have developed a robust infrastructure and set of execution capabilities across more than 50 countries, with a primary focus on our core markets of Japan, Greater China, Western Europe, and North America. We are selectively invested in emerging market areas whereby the combination of the business opportunity and consumer demographics intersect to form an attractive investment profile for our model. These markets include the Russia and the CIS countries, the Southern Cone of Africa, and selected markets in Latin America and South East Asia.

Corporate History 
 
NewAge, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington in April 2010. In mid-2016, we established our operational headquarters in Denver, Colorado, changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation and created a vision to commercialize healthy products through a differentiated route-to-market. During 2017, we up-listed to the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and acquired an initial portfolio of retail brands in a series of transactions in 2017 and 2018.
 
In 2018, we completed a business combination with Morinda that provided us with incremental scale, and the resources, team, and global execution capabilities to further our expansion and distribution of healthy products. Morinda is a Utah-based healthy beverage and products company founded in 1996 with infrastructure and operations in more than 50 countries around the world, and manufacturing operations in Tahiti, the U.S., China, Japan, and Germany. Morinda was the first company to commercially globally sell products derived from the noni plant, an antioxidant-rich, natural resource found in French Polynesia. Morinda is primarily a direct-to-consumer and e-commerce business.
 
In July 2019, we completed a business combination with Brands Within Reach, LLC (“BWR”). BWR owned key licensing and distribution rights in the United States for some of the world’s leading beverage brands including Nestea®, Volvic®, Evian® and Illy® Ready-to-Drink Coffee. In 2020, with the impact of COVID and the change in economics of retail brand beverages, we divested our initial portfolio of retail brands, to focus exclusively on our higher margin, higher potential brands sold direct to customers. All of these divested assets were included in the Direct Store segment from the date of acquisition through the disposal date and are referred to herein as the “Divested Business”. For periods after the disposal of the Divested Business, this segment is primarily comprised of our Direct Store Distribution (“DSD”) network that distributes beverages, snacks, and other products to retail customers in Colorado and surrounding states, and sells the portfolio of brands to wholesale distributors, key account owned warehouses, and international accounts using several distribution channels. 
 
On November 16, 2020, we completed a business combination with Ariix whereby Ariix became one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Ariix was formed in Utah in January 2011 and grew from inception to more than $200 million in net revenue in its nine-year history, making it one of the fastest growing companies in the direct selling industry over that time period. Ariix evolved through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions and brought to the combination with us a portfolio of growth brands spanning weight loss management, water and air filtration, personal care and skincare products. Ariix also included the standalone companies of LIMU, Zennoa, MaVie, and others in direct sales and e-commerce, all now included in our Direct / Social Selling segment beginning on the closing date of the Ariix business combination.
 
We have four direct subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. These subsidiaries consist of Morinda, Ariix, NABC, Inc., and NABC Properties, LLC (“NABC Properties”). NABC, Inc. is a Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance and financial results of the Company’s segments, subsidiaries, and divisions. NABC Properties administers a building owned by NewAge in southern Colorado.
 
Principal Products 
 
Our core business is developing, marketing, selling, and distributing a portfolio of healthy products sold primarily through a direct to customer business model using a team of more than 400,000 Brand Partners and distributors to help market and sell the portfolio of brands. We compete in three primary category platforms including health and wellness, healthy appearance, and nutritional performance. The product segments and subsegments within these categories represent large addressable growing markets. According to industry sources, the health and wellness industry comprises $4.2 trillion in annual revenue, and the beverage industry comprises $1 trillion in annual revenue. Our brands Tahitian Noni, LIMU, and Zennoa compete in this industry segment. Within the beverage industry, energy drinks constitute $80 billion in annual sales, where our brands LIMU Blue Frog and Hiro Natural Energy Drinks compete. Skincare and cosmetics constitute an industry of $650 billion in annual sales and we have two lead brands in this subsegment, TeMana and Lucim. Weight management is a $204 billion industry segment where our nutritional supplements and Slenderiize products compete. Personal care is a $250 billion industry segment where our brands Reviive and Puritii compete. The diagnostics industry is a $29 billion industry segment, where we compete with our DNA testing and diagnostic kits and products under our MaVie brand.

We also compete in the emerging CBD category and believe we have differentiated technology, especially when CBD is combined with our Tahitian Noni. Our studies have shown an increase in the receptivity in the endocannabinoid system in the body for CBD in combination with Noni by opening additional pathways and reducing inhibitors. We use this technology in our NONI+CBD shots that we commercialize in Japan, where we have gained first mover advantage, and according to one of the largest research companies in Japan, Fuji Keizai, NewAge reached the largest CBD sales in the CBD Supplement category in Japan. As additional markets open and regulations change (including in the United States), we believe we are in a competitively advantaged position both in leveraging our technology and in executing through our network of more than 400,000 Brand Partners to develop this attractive, scale, profitable, and disruptive market. We do not market or sell CBD beverages in the U.S. and do not intend to market or sell CBD ingestible products in the U.S. until we can do so in compliance with applicable laws.


Sales and Marketing 
 
We market our portfolio of healthy products using a range of marketing media, but given the significant shift in how customers are buying and what marketing mediums are influencing their purchase decisions, we have adjusted to evolve with changing consumer patterns to communicate using the most effective ways. As such, we primarily use our team of more than 400,000 Brand Partners worldwide for sales and marketing and are empowering them with the latest social selling tools and technology.
 
Supporting these 400,000 Brand Partners is a full-scale sales and marketing team of more than 200 people working at the corporate, regional, and local market levels worldwide, and we develop and execute promotions, incentives, new products, marketing, and sales collateral communication materials in more than 15 different languages across more than 50 countries.
 
We also market our portfolio of affiliate or distributed brands through our DSD distribution system. To support these brands, we have an in-house team of more than 100 sales, marketing, and merchandising associates exclusively focused on the United States.


Distribution 
 
The products in our Direct / Social Selling segment, which is a business-to-consumer model, are currently distributed in over 50 countries through primarily a direct route to market. Approximately 80% of our revenue is ordered and fulfilled online, and more than 80% of our products are delivered direct to customers’ homes. We have dedicated global, regional, and local manufacturing and major logistics and warehousing operations located in strategic locations worldwide to serve our global footprint of more than 400,000 Brand Partners.
Brand Partners
 
Our team of more than 400,000 Brand Partners worldwide are independent business professionals. Brand Partners are our independent representatives that have signed agreements with us and have the ability to earn commissions, as well as direct customers who have purchased products from our website. The individuals that comprise these groups have purchased products from us within the last twelve months. These professionals sell our products online through their own replicated websites, their social media feeds, and peer-to-peer connections. Purchasers of our products range from one-time customers to monthly subscribers that comprise the greatest share of our revenue. Customers or subscribers that then choose to make a business of selling our products then become affiliates or full Brand Partners whereby they are sponsored by an existing Brand Partner and become a member of the sponsoring Brand Partner’s sales organization. Brand Partners are required to fully comply with the Direct / Social Selling segment policies and procedures, including that Brand Partners will: (i) safeguard and protect our reputation and products; (ii) never communicate any deceptive, false, unethical, or unlawful customer or recruiting practices; (iii) never provide any deceptive, false, unethical, or unlawful claims about our products or compensation plan; and (iv) never promote or sell products that are competitive to our products. We may take disciplinary action (up to and including termination of a Brand Partner’s purchase and sales organization rights) if a Brand Partner violates these policies and procedures. In many markets, Brand Partners purchase an initial nominally priced portfolio of products for sale which also includes sales and educational materials to get a new Brand Partner started with his or her business.
 
After becoming a Brand Partner, individuals may purchase products directly at wholesale pricing for resale through their own replicated website, through their social feeds, and to their peer-to-peer customers, as well as, for personal use. In addition to their direct-to-customer sales, Brand Partners may build their businesses by sponsoring new Brand Partners. As Brand Partners sponsor others, generational levels are created in the Brand Partners organizational structure. We have no requirements for Brand Partners to sponsor new Brand Partners, and Brand Partners are not compensated for recruiting or sponsoring others. We focus on direct sales to millions of customers worldwide, and market our products directly to them. Customers who may want to build a business in addition to purchasing products may become Brand Partners and enjoy commissions and other benefits based on their sales. Brand Partner compensation is based on customer product sales of that individual and a portion from their respective sales organizations.
 
Although our global compensation plan is designed generally to permit Brand Partners to establish their sales organizations without country or border limitations, our business and compensation plan for China must be executed in a modified form due to Chinese laws and regulations. Only individuals who are residents of China and are eligible to work there may enroll as Brand Partners or as customers in China. The same general policies and procedures described above, modified for China, apply to Brand Partners in China. According to Chinese regulations, non-China residents are not permitted to sponsor Brand Partners in China, or otherwise participate in the compensation plan for China.

Brand Partner Compensation
 
Our compensation plan for Brand Partners is performance-based, consistent with our overall philosophy of how internal/direct associates are compensated whereby a significant portion of their total compensation is performance-based and at risk. Our compensation plan for Brand Partners has several attractive features and provides several opportunities for Brand Partners to earn compensation. The commission-based compensation system rewards Brand Partners for their sales and marketing efforts and is comparable to the combined sales and marketing expenses of a traditional consumer goods company. All compensation is conditioned on the Brand Partners’ good standing and compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures and the laws of the country where the Brand Partner does business. The integration of our compensation plan across international markets (except China) allows Brand Partners to earn commissions from global product sales along with local product sales.
Customers
 
The Direct / Social Selling segment is focused on e-commerce and direct product sales to customers. We offer customers the opportunity to become monthly subscribers, whereby they can enjoy additional benefits and savings on products and shipping, and offer subscribers an opportunity to become affiliates, whereby they can earn bonuses for new customers purchasing or becoming monthly subscribers. We then selectively offer affiliates, subscribers, and customers the opportunity to become Brand Partners whereby they have an opportunity to participate in the business and compensation plan and are eligible to earn commissions.
Business to Business Distribution
 
Our Direct / Social Selling segment is augmented by our Direct Store segment, which is a business-to-business model, and serves major traditional retail outlets in the United States including grocery retail, natural food retail, specialty outlets, hypermarkets, club stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, and gas stations. The compensation for associates in this model is also highly variable and performance-based, based on their sales and performance against established objectives.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
Our manufacturing facilities are in American Fork, Utah; Mataiea, Tahiti; Chongqing, China; Tianjin, China; and Alamosa, Colorado, with contract manufacturing in Tokyo, Japan; Bad Liebenwerda, Germany; and more than ten other facilities throughout the U.S. with preferred and qualified manufacturing partners that meet our stringent criteria for quality and safety. Each of our products are produced to exacting specifications and standards, and subject to strict quality control procedures.
 
Our largest brand, and related sourcing, manufacturing, bottling, and distribution system is Tahitian Noni® Juice. Our noni fruit is harvested from noni trees on 18 islands of French Polynesia by approximately 2,000 harvesters, who are independent contractors, and who work and coordinate with our representatives on each island. All fruit is checked at the time of harvest for quality, maturity, and purity. To date, we have maintained good relations with our suppliers and have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of the noni fruit.
 
The noni fruit is then shipped to our 85,000 square foot processing plant in Mataiea, Tahiti, where the fruit is again checked before being processed. This facility, as well as all facilities that produce products for us, adheres to the Good Manufacturing Practices as established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Tahiti facility is well-maintained, and the buildings and equipment are kept clean and in good repair and technology is up to date. The facility is regularly inspected by the French Polynesian authorities and by the FDA. We are one of the largest industries and exporters in Tahiti together with tourism and black pearl export. As such, we maintain and enjoy a very good relationship with the Tahitian government.
 
At this processing facility, the seeds are separated from the fruit. The seeds are later processed for oil extraction. The fruit is extensively inspected, pasteurized, and turned into puree, which is the key component of our Tahitian Noni Juice. The pasteurized puree is checked for quality and hermetically sealed in tote bins which are shipped by sea to ports in the United States, Japan, China and Germany for manufacturing our products. Each day the equipment used at this facility is automatically cleaned by a three step clean-in-place system. This system ensures the cleanliness of the equipment, tanks, and pipes used in the processing of the puree.

Reliance on Third-Party Suppliers and Distributors 
 
Except as noted above, we rely on various suppliers for raw and packaging materials, production, sale, and distribution of our products. The material terms of these relationships are typically negotiated annually and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from the date the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options and redundant supply options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third-party distribution needs. We have long-term relationships with our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply.
 
The contractual arrangements with third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are typical of the industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with third party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.


Competition 
 
Our business spans multiple sectors with competitors having similar product portfolios, similar routes-to-market, similar scales and geographic breadth, and/or similar business models. Those comparative sectors include:

- Similar business model/e-commerce marketplace companies: | ETSY, Pluralsight 
---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
- Similar CPG Brand Portfolio companies: | Hain Celestial, Caleres 
- Similar CBD/Cannabis exposure companies: | Aphria, Canopy 
- Similar Route to Market companies: | USANA, NuSkin 
- Similar IP/Product type companies: | Denali Therapeutics, ELF Beauty, Simply Good Foods 

 
Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, and as such, have more name recognition than we have. However, we believe that with our purpose-driven identity as a company, our healthy brand portfolio, our global reach and infrastructure, our compensation system, our relative financial strength and flexibility, our strong public company entity, and our team and inclusive culture that we can compete effectively in the industry and increase our market share from existing very large and growing product categories and large legacy competitors.
 
Research and Development Activities 
 
Our goal is to provide healthy, functionally differentiated, and superior performing products for customers worldwide. Historically, our research and development (“R&D”) efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for quality, efficacy, or cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading quality or fundamentally changing the customer appeal of our existing products. The second is in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated products, based on customer insights and trends and competitive opportunities.
 
Our Direct / Social Selling segment has an R&D group that drives our mission to provide healthy functional products across our three core category platforms, health and wellness, healthy appearance, and nutritional performance with real efficacy for consumers. In addition to developing new healthy and scientifically differentiated products and reviewing and improving existing formulas and processes for improvement and cost reductions, our R&D group continues to conduct and publish new, cutting edge benefits research on noni and other new products. R&D is an integral part of our global corporate structure, providing timely technical, regulatory, quality, processing and scientific standards, data, and expertise as needed and requested. Our R&D group, in partnership with other departments, maintains an extensive intellectual property database of patents, publications, formulations, and ideas that help protect and keep the Company in the forefront of healthy product offerings and product development. Our R&D group administers laboratories that provide analytical, chemical, microbiological, nutritional, and biochemical capabilities. We believe that we own the only lab in the world dedicated to the study of the noni plant and pioneering new innovative applications for noni, and as such continue to publish studies and insights into noni’s applications and benefits, as well as insights into all of our products and their benefits for fundamental human needs states.

Patents and Trademarks
 
We hold numerous issued U.S. patents and trademarks and have rights to additional intellectual property under license agreements with others. We also hold issued patents and trademarks in other countries. In addition, we have pending U.S. and international patent applications that cover numerous inventions. We also maintain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries, as well as, pending trademark applications in the U.S. and other countries and have rights to additional U.S. and international trademarks under license agreements.
 
We believe our intellectual property portfolio to be a core asset of the firm, and one which we expect to further develop and commercialize in our current and future portfolio offerings. We also rely on trade secrets and unique expertise and know how to protect our proprietary technology and may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how.
 
Government and Industry Regulation 
 
We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business. In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our Company’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements.
 
Under a California law known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:
 

● | below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | naturally occurring; 
● | the result of necessary cooking; or 
● | subject to another applicable exemption. 

 
One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added in the future, can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. With respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to substances that are already listed, the Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future.
 
We use nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. We also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain packaging containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.


Our facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our Company’s capital expenditures, net income, or competitive position.
 
We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The interpretation and application of data privacy and data protection laws and regulations are often uncertain and are evolving in the United States and internationally. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business and develop strategies to address regulatory trends and developments, including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales of our products are somewhat seasonal but with a portfolio of global markets seasonality is significantly diminished. Peak summer months account for a slightly higher level of sales, with the winter months being our lowest level of sales due to holidays in the Americas and Europe in December, holidays in January in Japan, and Chinese New Year in February impacting our business in the Greater China markets.

Environment, Sustainability and Governance
 
As a global social selling and distributor of health and wellness products operating in more than 50 countries, the values of environment, sustainability, and governance (“ESG”) are important issues that we are in the process of integrating into our business strategy and performance.
 
We understand the impact that good socially responsible companies can make in their global communities. At NewAge, we take this responsibility very seriously and have efforts underway to implement best in class practices to improve our social and environmental impacts. Our focus is to make sustainable decisions in every area of business, from selecting our raw materials, to our product design, to our manufacturing and shipping practices, to ensure that our planet’s finite resources are used efficiently. Accordingly, reducing our carbon footprint and helping to protect our natural resources is integral to our ESG plan. We will continue to focus on new ways to conserve water, recycle plastic, and save energy at each of our global offices, improving our social responsibility on a world-wide basis.
 
We also know that people come first. Each and every day we work to provide a safe work environment, to empower people around the world with accessible technology while creating a diverse work environment where we all respect the human rights of everyone’s lives that we touch. We will continue to identify opportunities for sustainable growth and manage our risks alongside our employees, Brand Partners, business partners, and communities around the planet.


Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,127 employees globally, including 36 that worked for us on a part time basis. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
