  Our Financial Strategy
 In addition to managing our business and growth initiatives, we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity. The Company employs a disciplined approach to capital allocation and deployment of cash that strives to balance the growth of our business and continued cash generation while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. The priorities for uses of available cash include the servicing of our debt, the continued payment of quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders, the funding of targeted growth initiatives, and the repurchase of our ordinary shares. Management expects that the combination of strong cash flow generation, continued profitability, and spending discipline will continue to provide the Company with flexibility to pursue organic and inorganic growth. Business Segments and Products
 We operate our business in two divisions: Performance Materials and Basic Plastics & Feedstocks. Our two divisions are of similar size in terms of sales, but have different margin profiles, different strategic focus, different value drivers and different operating requirements. By organizing in this way, we believe that we can best manage and operate the Company, focusing on accelerating the growth of our Performance Materials division and improving the profitability of our Basic Plastics & Feedstocks division.

 Our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, previously managed our operations under four reporting segments: Latex, Synthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, and Basic Plastics & Feedstocks. Effective October 1, 2016, the Company realigned its reporting segments in order to provide increased clarity and understanding around the drivers of profitability and cash flow in our business. First, the previous Basic Plastics & Feedstocks segment was split into three new segments: Basic Plastics, which includes polystyrene, copolymers, and polycarbonate; Feedstocks, which represents our styrene monomer business; and Americas Styrenics, which reflects the equity earnings from our 50%-owned styrenics joint venture. In addition, certain highly differentiated acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (or ABS) supplied into Performance Plastics markets, which was previously included in the results of Basic Plastics & Feedstocks, is now included in Performance Plastics. Finally, the Latex segment was renamed to Latex Binders. 
 Prior period financial information included within this Annual Report has been recast from its previous presentation to reflect the Company’s new organizational structure.
 The following chart provides an overview of this organizational structure:

 The major products in our Performance Materials division include: styrene-butadiene latex, or SB latex, and styrene-acrylate latex, or SA latex, in our Latex Binders segment; SSBR, lithium polybutadiene rubber, or Li-PBR, emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber, or ESBR, nickel polybutadiene rubber, or Ni-PBR, and neodymium polybutadiene rubber, or Nd-PBR, in our Synthetic Rubber segment; highly engineered compounds and blends products for automotive end markets, as well as consumer electronics, medical, electrical and lighting, which we collectively call consumer essential markets, or CEM, in our Performance Plastics segment. The major products in our Basic Plastics & Feedstocks division include:  polystyrene, polycarbonate, or PC, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, or ABS, and styrene-acrylonitrile, or SAN, in our Basic Plastics reporting segment; styrene monomer in our Feedstocks segment; and styrene and polystyrene in our Americas Styrenics reporting segment
 Refer to Note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment, which is the performance metric used by management to evaluate our segments’ performance, as well as sales and long-lived assets by geographic area.
 Latex Binders Segment 
 Overview 
 We are a global leader in SB latex, holding a strong market position across the geographies and applications in which we compete, including the #1 position in SB latex capacity in Europe and the #1 position in capacity in North America. In 2016 approximately 42% of our Latex Binders segment’s sales were generated in Europe, 28% were generated in the United States, and the majority of the remaining net sales were generated in Asia. Products and End Uses 
 We hold the #1 position for supplying SB latex for the coated paper market globally. SB latex is widely used as a binder for mineral pigments as it allows high coating speeds, improved smoothness, higher gloss level, opacity and water resistance that is valued in the product’s end use in advertising, magazines, and packaging board coatings.
 We are also a leading supplier of latex polymers and binders to the carpet and artificial turf industries and offer a diverse range of products for use in residential and commercial broadloom, needlefelt, and woven carpet backings. We produce high solids SB latex, SA latex, vinylidene chloride, and butadiene-methacrylate latex products for the 

 
  7

 
commercial and niche carpet markets. We incorporate vinyl acrylic latex in our formulations for its ignition resistant properties, with the sourcing of vinyl acrylic latex readily available from a number of industry suppliers. SB latex is also used in flooring as an adhesive for carpet and artificial turf fibers.
 We also offer a broad range of performance latex products, including SB latex, SA latex, and vinylidene chloride latex primarily for the adhesive, building and construction as well as the technical textile paper market, and have begun to implement the use of starch and associated new chemistries in paper coatings and carpet backing.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Latex Binders segment include BASF Group, Omnova Solutions Inc., and Synthomer plc. In our Latex Binders segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. We also believe our growth prospects could be enhanced if the recent trend of industry capacity reduction and consolidation continues.
 We believe our Latex Binders segment is able to differentiate itself by offering customers value-added formulation and product development expertise. Our R&D team and Technical Services and Development team, which we refer to as TS&D, are able to use our two pilot coating facilities in Switzerland and the United States, three paper fabrication and testing labs in China, Switzerland and the United States, three carpet technology centers located near carpet producers in China, the United States and Switzerland, and two product development and process research centers, one each in Germany and the United States, to assist customers in designing new products and enhancing the manufacturing process. Many of our major customers rely on our dedicated R&D and TS&D teams to complement their limited in-house resources for formulation and reformulation tests and trials. We believe that this capability allows us to capture new business, strengthen our existing customer relationships and broaden our technological expertise. 
 Additionally, our global manufacturing capabilities are key in serving customers cost-effectively, as latex binders are costly to ship over long distances due to their high water content. We believe that our global network of service and manufacturing facilities is highly valued by our customers. We seek to capture the value of our R&D and TS&D services and manufacturing capabilities through our pricing strategy. In 2016, we estimate that approximately one half of net sales in this segment related to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses.
 Synthetic Rubber Segment 
 Overview 
 We are a significant producer of styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene-based rubber products and we have a leading European market position, providing approximately 52% of Western Europe’s SSBR capacity available for sale. While substantially all of our sales were generated in Europe in 2016, approximately 25% of these net sales were exported to Asia, 8% to North America, and 6% to Latin America. Products and End Uses 
 Our Synthetic Rubber segment produces synthetic rubber products used in high-performance tires, impact modifiers and technical rubber products, such as conveyor belts, hoses, seals and gaskets. We participate significantly in the European synthetic rubber industry, where tire producers focus on high-performance and ultra high-performance tires and rely heavily on rubber suppliers to provide their supply of rubber, in contrast to North America where tire manufacturers produce most of their required rubber. We have a broad synthetic rubber technology and product portfolio, focusing on specialty products, such as SSBR, Li-PBR, and Nd-PBR, while also producing core products, such as ESBR. Our synthetic rubber products are extensively used in tires, with approximately 85% of our net sales from this segment in 2016 attributable to the tire market. We estimate that 75% of these sales relate to replacement tires. We have strong relationships with many of the top global tire manufacturers and believe we have remained a supplier of choice as a result of our broad rubber portfolio and ability to offer technologically differentiated product and product customization capabilities. Other applications for our synthetic rubber products include polymer modification and technical rubber goods.
 SSBR. We sell SSBR products for high-performance and ultra high-performance tire applications. We produce both clear and oil extended SSBR through batch polymerization in our three SSBR production lines. We believe these processes provide leading and technologically differentiated solutions to tire manufacturers.

 During the last six years, we have been working closely with major tire producers around the world to develop multiple new SSBR grades, addressing key marketplace needs for improved tire fuel economy, grip, and abrasion characteristics, which we believe will lead to significant demand growth for our rubber products in Europe and around the world. We expect our synthetic rubber product mix to continue to shift to more advanced SSBR grades (from approximately 8% of total Synthetic Rubber volume sold in 2011 to 28% in 2016) in order to meet expected demand growth. In 2016, SSBR represented approximately 60% of total segment net sales. 
 Performance tires represent an especially attractive market to rubber producers because they provide substantial value to end customers and the market for performance tires is expected to grow at a rate that is 2 to 3 times that of the standard tire market. Tire manufacturers are expected to continually seek improvements in advanced rubber, which optimizes the combination of fuel economy and wet grip in order to meet EU regulations which set minimum requirements and are being phased in through 2020. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are considering similar legislation and are also beginning to adopt the tire labeling requirements that have become mandatory in Europe. We believe our growth prospects are enhanced by increasing demand for high performance tires, which are now more commonly used by automakers as original equipment manufacturer specified tires in their vehicles as a result of regulatory reforms in the EU, Japan and Korea that are aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
 ESBR. Our ESBR products are used in standard tires, technical goods, and footwear. Our ESBR product portfolio offers tire producers a comprehensive suite of synthetic rubber capabilities. For example, ESBR provides enhanced wet grip to tire treads and strength to the inner liner of tires, allowing the tires to be more easily processed. In 2016, ESBR represented approximately 33% of total segment net sales.
 Ni-PBR and Nd-PBR. Throughout much of 2016, we sold Ni-PBR products for use in standard tires, performance tires, technical goods and footwear. In 2016, Ni-PBR represented approximately 5% of total segment net sales. In November 2015, we completed the conversion of our Ni-PBR production capacity at our Schkopau, Germany facility to a swing line, allowing for the production of Ni-PBR as well Nd-PBR, a more advanced, higher margin polybutadiene rubber that is a key material in the latest generation of performance tires, and is also sold for use in industrial rubber goods and polymer modification. In 2016, we began trials of Nd-PBR production, and expect to increase sales in this area in the future.
 Li-PBR. Our Li-PBR is used primarily for our own internal polymer modification applications. Polymer modification is the use of synthetic rubber to improve the impact resistance quality of plastic products. In 2016, approximately 85% of our Li-PBR products were consumed within our Basic Plastics segment for high impact polystyrene, or HIPS, and ABS production. We make two grades of Li-PBR exclusively for our polymer modification uses. In addition to impact resistance, Li-PBR provides visual surface gloss. In 2016, Li-PBR represented approximately 2% of total segment net sales.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Synthetic Rubber segment include Asahi Kasei Corporation, JSR Corporation, ARLANXEO, Zeon Corporation, Versalis S.p.A and Synthos S.A. In our Synthetic Rubber segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. We maintain deep and long-standing relationships with a large number of multinational customers, including many of the top global tire manufacturers, as well as fast growing Asian tire manufacturers. Our relationships with our top customers, including with our predecessor business operated by Dow prior to the Acquisition (as defined in Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements), exceed 10 years on average. Our top three customers in this segment accounted for 54% of our net sales in this reporting segment. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Synthetic Rubber segment.
 We believe we have remained a supplier of choice given our broad rubber portfolio, including technologically differentiated grades, and our product customization capabilities. Our R&D and TS&D teams use our broad rubber portfolio to develop differentiated specialty products for customers. Once implemented with a customer, these newly-developed specialty products cannot be easily replaced with a competitor’s product. As a result, we believe customers are likely to buy from us throughout the life cycle of specific tire models to avoid high switching costs and prevent repetition of the expensive development process.

 Enhanced SSBR, which includes later generations of SSBR and functionalized SSBR and is used in the new generation of performance tires, is expected to approach 50% of the total SSBR market by 2018. We believe the Company is well-positioned to capture additional market share in the high-growth, high-performance tire application markets. We expect that demand for enhanced SSBR will grow at a rate in excess of supply, resulting in an expected increase in industry utilization rates. 
 In order to address this anticipated demand, the Company has added 75 kMT of SSBR capacity since 2012 and plans to have an additional 50kT in SSBR capacity come online in January 2018 at our Schkopau, Germany facility. By the end of 2017, we also expect to have operational a new SSBR rubber pilot plant that will expedite the product development process from lab sample to commercialization by delivering sufficient quantities of new formulations without the need to interrupt production in our industrial lines.
 While we export our rubber products worldwide, our production facilities currently are solely in Europe.  Therefore, we may face competitive challenges with rubber customers who would prefer local rubber manufacturers.
 We seek to capture the value of our R&D and TS&D services through our pricing strategy. We estimate that approximately 80% of net sales in this segment relate to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses.
 Performance Plastics Segment
 Overview
 We are a producer of highly engineered compounds and blends for automotive end markets, as well as consumer electronics, medical, electrical, and lighting, or CEM. In 2016, approximately 41% of our Performance Plastics segment’s net sales were generated in Europe, approximately 28% were generated in the United States, and approximately 18% were generated in Asia, with the remainder in other geographic regions, including Latin America and Canada. Products and End Uses 
 Our Performance Plastics segment consists of compounds and blends and some specialized ABS grades. We have a significant position in PC/ABS blends, which combine the heat resistance and impact strength of PC with the easy to process qualities and resilience of ABS. Our Performance Plastics segment also compounds and blends our PC and ABS plastics into differentiated products for customers within these sectors, as well as compounds of polypropylene. We have also developed compounds containing post-consumer recycled polymers to respond to what we believe is a growing need for some customers to include recycled content in their products. We believe our ability to offer technologically differentiated products to meet customer needs sets us apart from our competitors, and with our history as a leading innovator in compounds and blends, we have established ourselves as a leading supplier of PC-based products.
 For the automotive industry, we manufacture PC blends under the PULSE™ brand, and we innovate collaboratively with our customers to develop performance solutions to meet the industry’s needs, such as reducing the weight of vehicles. As a result, we are a key supplier of these products to leading automotive companies in North America and Europe, who tend to specify these products on a per car program platform basis, making it difficult to be displaced as a supplier once selected and providing us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows for several years during the production lifecycle. We are also accelerating our development of similar supply capabilities in growing areas such as China.
 For the consumer electronics, electrical and lighting and medical device industries, we manufacture our products under the EMERGE™ brand, among others, and we believe that we have substantial growth opportunities in tablets, notebooks, smart phones and other handheld devices, and electrical and lighting and medical device components. In serving these markets, we leverage our polymer and compound technologies to meet increasingly stringent performance requirements along with the aesthetic and color-matching requirements which are crucial characteristics for the products involved.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Performance Plastics segment are Covestro AG, LG Chem Ltd., Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, Teijin Limited, Borealis AG, Celanese Corporation, 

 
  10

 
Styrolution Group, and LyondellBasell Industries. In our Performance Plastics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our customer relationships.
 We believe growth in the Performance Plastic segment is driven by a number of factors, including consumer preference for lighter weight and impact-resistant products and the development of new consumer electronics, increases in LED lighting applications and continuing growth in medical device applications. Additionally, we believe growth is bolstered by sustainability trends, such as the substitution of lighter-weight plastics for metal in automobiles. Therefore, we believe our history of innovation and our focus on differentiated products enhances our growth prospects in this segment. Our innovation has contributed to long-standing relationships with customers who are recognized leaders in their respective end-markets. We also believe our global facilities are a competitive advantage that allows us to provide customers with consistent grades across markets and positions us to strategically serve emerging markets.
 Basic Plastics Segment 
 Overview 
 Basic Plastics consists of styrenic polymers, including polystyrene, ABS, and SAN products, as well as PC. We do not anticipate investing in strategic growth initiatives in this segment in the near term. In 2016, approximately 69% of sales from our Basic Plastics segment were generated in Europe and an additional 25% of sales were generated in Asia. Products and End Uses 
 Polystyrene. We are a leading producer of polystyrene and focus on sales to injection molding and thermoforming customers. Our product offerings include a variety of general purpose polystyrenes, or GPPS, and HIPS, which is polystyrene that has been modified with polybutadiene rubber to increase its impact resistant properties. These products provide customers with performance and aesthetics at a low cost across applications, including appliances, packaging, including food packaging and food service disposables, consumer electronics and building and construction materials.
 We believe our STYRON™ brand is one of the longest established brands in the industry and is widely recognized in the global marketplace. We believe our R&D efforts have resulted in valuable, differentiated solutions for our customers. For instance, during the early 2000s, we developed an innovative STYRON A-TECH™ family of resins that is an advanced polystyrene product allowing customers to balance key properties such as toughness, gloss, stiffness, flow and cost, and provide combinations of properties that were previously not available with standard HIPS. We believe that over the past decade, this product family has become the industry standard for this application. In 2016, polystyrene represented approximately 62% of total segment net sales.
 Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS). We are a leading producer of ABS in Europe and are one of the few producers with a presence in North America. We produce mass ABS, or mABS, a variation of ABS that has lower conversion and capital costs compared to the more common emulsion ABS, or eABS, process, marketed under our MAGNUM™ brand. mABS has similar properties to eABS but has greater colorability, thermal stability and lower gloss. mABS products can be manufactured to stricter specifications because it is produced in a continuous process as opposed to the batch process used in eABS. mABS also has environmental benefits such as waste reduction and higher yields. In addition to our own mABS production capacity, we have licensed our proprietary mABS technology to other producers.
 Primary end uses for our ABS products include automotive and construction sheet applications. We maintain a significant share of ABS sales into these markets, which we believe is driven by the differentiating attributes of our mABS products, our reputation as a knowledgeable supplier, our broad product mix and our customer collaboration and design capabilities. In 2016, ABS products represented approximately 21% of total segment net sales.
 Styrene-Acrylonitrile. SAN is composed of styrene and acrylonitrile, which together provide clarity, stiffness, enhanced ability to be processed, mechanical strength, barrier properties, chemical resistance and heat resistance. SAN is used mainly in appliances, consumer goods and construction sheets, due to its low-cost, clarity and chemical resistance properties. Within our Basic Plastics segment, we manufacture SAN under the TYRIL™ brand name for use in housewares, appliances, automotive, construction sheets, battery cases and lighting applications. In addition, TYRIL™ is suitable for self-coloring which adds value in many of these uses. In 2016, SAN represented approximately 4% of total segment net sales.

 
  11

 

 Polycarbonate. PC has high levels of clarity, impact resistance and temperature resistance. PC can be used in its neat form (prior to any compounding or blending) for markets such as construction sheet, optical media and LED lighting. Additionally, PC can be compounded or blended with other polymers, such as ABS, which imparts specific performance attributes tailored to the product’s end-use.
 Our products for glazing and construction sheets are marketed under the CALIBRE™ brand name and offer customers a combination of clarity, heat resistance and impact performance. Glazing and construction sheet represents our largest PC application, and is a key growth focus for us. Key end-markets include the construction industry, with additional opportunities for growth with compounded products in the medical device market, consumer electronics and other applications such as smart meter casings that require plastics with enhanced weatherability, ignition resistance and impact performance. In 2016, PC represented approximately 13% of total segment net sales.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Basic Plastics segment are Styrolution Group GmbH, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., Covestro AG, LG Chem Ltd., Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Formosa Plastics Corporation, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited, and Chi Mei Corporation. In our Basic Plastics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. 
 Our customer centric model focuses on understanding customers’ needs and developing tailored solutions that create value for both parties. For durable applications, we focus our TS&D, R&D and marketing teams on product design engineering initiatives for developing and specifying plastics in the next generation of construction applications, appliances, automotive, and consumer electronics. In non-durable applications, we focus on innovative products that provide clear cost advantages to our customers, serving customers with our cost-advantaged technology and operating excellence. We have leveraged industry-leading product development and technology capabilities in many of our basic plastics product lines to develop long-standing customer relationships with many of our customers, including a number who have purchased from us, including our predecessor business operated by Dow prior to the Acquisition, for more than 20 years. We believe that our global presence is an advantage, allowing us to provide customers with consistent product grades and positioning us to strategically serve growth economies.
 We have a leading competitive position in many of the products in our basic plastics segment. However, for PC, we have a lower competitive position than those of our peers, which may ultimately impact our ability to implement an effective pricing strategy. The ABS market has also experienced a number of capacity rationalizations since 2006. These rationalizations, combined with improved end-market demand, have resulted in a substantial improvement in operating rates since the most recent global economic downturn. We believe the Company’s global footprint make the Basic Plastics segment well-positioned to compete in this market.
 Feedstocks Segment
 Overview
 Our Feedstocks segment is primarily focused on the revenue and profitability related to the Company’s production and procurement of styrene monomer outside of North America. The Feedstocks segment supplied 15% of the styrene monomer capacity out of Europe in 2016. Annually, the Company produces nearly 700 kilotons of styrene in Western Europe and purchases approximately 300 kilotons of styrene in Asia on a raw material cost basis. With all other inputs remaining equal, a $50 per metric ton change in styrene margin over raw materials would be expected to impact our Feedstock reporting segment’s annual Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $35 million and $15 million in Europe and Asia, respectively. Products and End Uses
 Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber. 

 
  12

 

 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Feedstocks segment are:  Styrolution Group GmbH, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., BASF SE, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, LyondellBasell, Repsol S.A., Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited, and Royal Dutch Shell plc. The majority of styrene monomer produced within the Feedstocks segment is consumed by the Company in its own manufacturing activities.
 Within styrene monomer, we believe there is a current and longer term trend towards higher styrene margins, due to demand growth, an aging industry asset base, and limited new capacity expected over the next several years that will allow the Company to remain competitive. Global styrene operating rates were approximately 85% in 2016 and are forecasted to remain flat through 2020. These relatively high operating rates can result in periods of elevated margins due to planned or unplanned production outages. 
 Americas Styrenics Segment
 Overview 
 This segment solely consists of the operations of our 50%-owned joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, Americas Styrenics LLC (“Americas Styrenics”), which continues to be a leading producer in North America of both styrene and polystyrene. Specifically, Americas Styrenics is the #1 producer of polystyrene in North America. In 2016, Americas Styrenics supplied 17% of the styrene monomer capacity in North America. Additionally, we received $130.0 million in cash dividends from Americas Styrenics during 2016.  Products and End Uses
 Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, and in 2016 approximately 63% of the styrene monomer produced by Americas Styrenics is consumed in its own production of polystyrene. The remainder of Americas Styrenics’ product is sold as a key raw material to other manufacturers of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber. 
 Americas Styrenics also produces GPPS, high heat, high impact resin, and STYRON A-TECH™ polystyrene products. Major applications for these polystyrene products include appliances, food packaging, food service disposables, consumer electronics and building and construction materials.
 Competition and Customers
 Americas Styrenics’ principal competitors are Styrolution Group GmbH, Total S.p.A. and LyondellBasell. In our Americas Styrenics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships.
 As a leading styrenics producer in North America, this segment is well-positioned to benefit from the recent consolidation dynamics in the styrene and polystyrene industries within the region. With global utilization rates expected to steadily improve as demand grows in end-markets, we believe opportunities will be created for us, given our scale and geographic reach that will benefit the Americas Styrenics segment. However, like many of competitors in the styrenics market, the aged assets associated with this segment may result in unplanned outages that may adversely impact our service levels and competitive position.

In addition, either party may terminate for cause, which includes a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, for material breach which is not cured, or by Dow in the event of our failure to pay for the services thereunder. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement, Dow has the right to terminate the SAR MOSA.
 We use SAP’s Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) software systems to support our operations worldwide and to manage our day-to-day business processes and relationships with customers and suppliers. Under the SAR MOSA, Dow provides us with ERP systems support, global data/voice network and server infrastructure for desktop computing, email, file sharing, intranet and internet website access, and mainframe and midrange computer access.
 Under the AR MOD5 Agreement, Dow provides worldwide process control technology, including hardware, software licenses and support services, and related enterprise resource planning services. The AR MOD5 Agreement, with a term through December 2020, may be terminated by either party for cause, which includes a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, for material breach which is not cured by us if we no longer wish to receive maintenance and support for any licensed software; or by Dow if we use the licensed software for any purposes other than Company business. Dow may terminate the maintenance and support terms at any time if we fail to make payments when due and the default is not corrected within 30 days from notice, or upon two years written notice us, if Dow has made the decision not to support the software systems, provided that Dow will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in locating and transitioning to an alternate service provider. While we are not permitted to use this automation technology for new plants or to substantially expand existing plants, we can use other technology solutions for those situations. We have started to move our plants off the AR MOD5 process control technology through a strategic external relationship with ABB Ltd. and expect to convert all of our plants by 2020.
 In addition, we entered into various site services agreements with Dow, which were modified as of June 1, 2013, (the “Amendment Date”) where at Dow owned sites, Dow provides site services to Company. Conversely, we entered into similar agreements with Dow in June 2010, where at Company owned sites, we provide such services to Dow. These SAR SSAs cover general services that are provided at specific facilities co-located with Dow, rather than organization-wide services, and include utilities, site administration, environmental health and safety, site maintenance and supply chain. In certain circumstances, the parties may adjust certain prices and volumes. These agreements generally have 25-year terms from the Amendment Date, with options to renew. These agreements may be terminated at any time by agreement of the parties, or, by either party, for cause, including a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, or under certain circumstances for a material breach which is not cured. In addition, we may terminate for convenience any services that Dow has agreed to provide to us that are identified in any site services agreement as “terminable” with 12 months prior notice to Dow, dependent upon whether the service is highly integrated into Dow operations. Highly integrated services are agreed to be nonterminable. With respect to “nonterminable” services that Dow has agreed to provide to us, such as electricity and steam, we generally cannot terminate such services prior to the termination date unless we experience a production unit shut down for which we provide Dow with 15-months prior notice, or upon payment of a shutdown fee. Upon expiration or termination, we would be obligated to pay a monthly fee to Dow, which obligation extends for a period of 45 (in the case of expiration) to 60 months (in the case of termination) following the respective event of each site services agreement. The agreements under which Dow receives services from us may be terminated under the same circumstances and conditions.
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we incurred a total of $224.7 million, $244.8 million, and $285.2 million in expenses under the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and site services agreements (which include utilities), including $174.8 million, $194.1 million, and $233.7 million, respectively, for both the variable and fixed cost components of the site service agreements and $49.9 million, $50.7 million, $51.5 million, respectively, covering all other agreements.
 In addition, upon Acquisition, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement pursuant to which we operate and maintain our SAN facility in Midland, Michigan to produce products for Dow. This agreement has a 25-year term, with automatic renewals for five-year terms unless one party gives notice at least 18 months prior to the end of the period. We may terminate any operational service under the agreement in the event that we experience a production unit

shutdown, with 15-months prior notice to Dow. Furthermore, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement between the parties, by either party on notice that the other party fails to cure non-performance or if the other party is in material breach of a material obligation under the agreement within certain parameters, or because of either party’s insolvency.
 We have also entered into certain license agreements pursuant to which we have obtained exclusive licenses to use certain of Dow’s intellectual property in connection with the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow and non-exclusive licenses to use certain Dow intellectual property, other than patents, with respect to products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. While our license rights are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex binders and, to a lesser extent, plastics involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be adversely impacted by intellectual property rights that have been retained by Dow.
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, purchases and other charges from Dow and its affiliated companies (excluding the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and site services agreements) were approximately $865.7 million, $999.4 million, and $1,910.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, sales to Dow and its affiliated companies were approximately $203.5 million, $227.0 million, and $343.8 million, respectively.
 We continue to leverage Dow’s scale and operational capabilities by procuring certain raw materials, utilities, site services, and other information technology and business services from Dow. In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into several agreements with Dow relating to the provision of certain products and services and other operational arrangements. Dow provides significant operating and other services, and certain raw materials used in the production of our products, under agreements that are important to our business. The failure of Dow to perform their obligations, or the termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A—Risk Factors.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 The prices of our key raw materials are volatile and can fluctuate significantly over time. While the predominant driver of this volatility is the impact of market imbalances in supply and demand from time to time, energy prices may also impact the volatility of some of our raw materials. The table below shows our key raw materials by reporting segment.
 | Performance Materials | Basic Plastics & Feedstocks
 | Latex | Synthetic | Performance | Basic | | Americas 
 | Binders | Rubber | Plastics | Plastics | Feedstocks | Styrenics
Benzene | | | | | X | X 
Bisphenol A | | | | X | | 
Butadiene | X | X | | | | 
Ethylene | | | | | X | X 
Polycarbonate | | | X | | | 
Styrenic resins | | | X | | | 
Styrene | X | X | | X | X | X 

  We have supply contracts in place to help maintain our supply of raw materials at competitive market prices and seek to implement the most efficient and reliable raw material strategy for each of our segments, including maintaining a balance between contracted and spot purchases of raw materials. We also produce raw materials for use by our businesses, such as styrene monomer. 
 In 2016, we obtained approximately 31% of our raw materials from Dow (based on aggregate purchase price). While Dow provides a significant portion of our raw materials to us pursuant to supply agreements, we have developed a comprehensive strategy for obtaining additional sources of supply where needed. Our 2010 agreements with Dow for ethylene, benzene, and butadiene, have 10-year terms with automatic 2-year renewal provisions. Minimum and maximum monthly contract quantities were established based on historical consumption rates, and our pricing terms are based on commodity indices in the relevant geography.

 In 2016, Dow supplied us with approximately 98% of our benzene requirements and 100% of our ethylene requirements through 10-year contracts that commenced in 2010 and include automatic 2-year renewal provisions. Dow is our largest supplier for these materials in Europe, where we purchase directly from Dow’s existing butadiene extraction facilities pursuant to the terms of a 10-year contract that commenced in 2010 and includes an automatic 2-year renewal term. Other supply sources in Europe include major producers with contract terms of up to five years at competitive market prices. Supply to North America and Asia are exclusively from other major third party producers via supply contracts.
 In addition to purchasing styrene through long-term strategic contracts and spot market purchases, we produce styrene internally from purchased ethylene and benzene at our own manufacturing sites. These sources provided 41%, 15%, and 44%, respectively, of our supply in 2016. With this mix of purchased and produced styrene, we seek to optimize our overall costs of securing styrene through efficient logistics, manufacturing economics and market dynamics.
 BPA is the major raw material associated with PC production. This raw material is produced by a subsidiary of Olin Corporation and is supplied via pipeline to us through a supply contract in Europe that has an initial term expiring in December 2019. We source BPA for Sumika Styron Polycarbonate Limited (“Sumika Styron Polycarbonate”), our Asian joint venture, from other market participants.
 Technology 
 Our R&D and TS&D activities across our segments focus on identifying needs in our customers’ end-markets. As part of our customer-centric model, our R&D/TS&D organization interfaces with our sales and marketing teams and directly with customers to determine their product requirements in light of trends in their industries and market segments. This information is used to select R&D/TS&D projects that are value-enhancing for both our customers and us.
 Our R&D facilities support our technological capabilities. In addition to our two SB latex pilot coaters and our product development centers, certain of our businesses operate “mini plants” in Stade and Schkopau, Germany. These mini plants are used to make samples of experimental products for testing, which we believe is a critical step in our new product development process.
 R&D and TS&D costs are included in expenses as incurred. Our R&D and TS&D costs were $51.0 million, $51.9 million, and $53.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We have a customer-centric business model that has helped us to develop strong relationships with many customers. Our sales and marketing professionals are primarily located at our facilities or at virtual offices within their respective geographies. We have approximately 126 professionals working in sales and marketing around the world, along with approximately 79 customer service professionals and we sell our products to customers in over 80 countries. We primarily market our products through our direct sales force. Typically our direct sales are made by our employees in the regions closest to the given customer. Intellectual Property 
 We evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to utilize patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property in order to protect our products and our critical investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We focus on securing and maintaining patents for certain inventions, while maintaining other inventions as trade secrets, derived from our customer-centric business model, in an effort to maximize the value of our product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities. Our policy is to seek appropriate protection for significant product and process developments in the major markets where the relevant products are manufactured or sold. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product uses. Patents extend for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of subject matter covered by the patent and the scope of the claims of the patent.

 
  16

 

 In most industrial countries, patent protection may be available for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, given the geographical scope of our business and our continued growth strategy, there are regions of the world in which we do business or may do business in the future where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. These information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors’ products and, if circumstances were to dictate that we do so, we would vigorously challenge the actions of others that conflict with our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
 The technologies we utilize in some of our business lines have been in use for many years (e.g., SB latex and ABS) and a number of our patents relating to such technologies have expired or will expire in within the next several years. As patents expire, or are allowed to lapse, the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public. We believe that the expiration of any single patent or family of patents that is scheduled to expire in the next 3 years would not materially adversely affect our business or financial results. We believe that our trade secrets relating to manufacturing and other processes used in connection with products to which expiring patents relate will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage after the expiration of these patents.
 We use trademarks as a means of differentiating our products. We protect our trademarks against infringement where we deem appropriate. We have successfully registered the TRINSEO™ trademark in over 90 countries and have other trademark applications pending.
 Dow has either transferred to us or granted perpetual, royalty-free licenses to us to use Dow’s intellectual property that was used by Dow to operate the Styron business prior to the Acquisition. This intellectual property includes certain processes, compositions and apparatus used in the manufacture of our products. In addition to our license rights to use Dow’s intellectual property related to the Styron business, we have obtained licenses to use Dow’s intellectual property to the extent necessary to perform our obligations under the contracts transferred to us in the Acquisition and to use such intellectual property (other than patents) for products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. While we believe our license rights with respect to Dow’s intellectual property are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex binders and, to a lesser extent, plastics involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be impacted by intellectual property rights that have not been licensed to us by Dow. We have the right, with Dow’s cooperation, to directly enforce the patents that are exclusively licensed to us by Dow where infringement is primarily within the scope of our business; but nothing obligates Dow to enforce against third parties the intellectual property rights of Dow that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis or where the infringement is primarily outside the scope of our business.
 Since our formation on June 17, 2010, we have focused our product innovation on the Performance Materials division, including the Synthetic Rubber, Latex Binders and Performance Plastics segments. The intellectual property that we have created since we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow is largely in these segments and covers areas such as material formulations, material process technologies and various end-use industrial applications.

 Environmental and Other Regulations 
 Obtaining, producing and distributing many of our products involve the use, storage, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. We are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and regulations, which address, among other things, the following:
· | emissions to the air;
--+----------------------


· | discharges to soils and surface and subsurface waters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | other releases into the environment;
--+-------------------------------------


· | prevention, remediation or abatement of releases of hazardous materials into the indoor or outdoor environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | registration and evaluation of chemicals;
--+------------------------------------------


· | production, handling, labeling or use of chemicals used or produced by us; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stewardship of products after manufacture.
--+-------------------------------------------

  Some of our products are also subject to food contact regulations. 
 We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable state, national, and international environmental, health and safety requirements. Trinseo’s Supplier Code of Conduct includes our expectations for our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and encourages them to adhere to the highest principles of environmental responsibility. We have a strong environmental, health and safety organization. We follow the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care® Guiding Principles for our global facilities and last received third party certification of our Responsible Care® Management System in 2016. We have a staff of professionals who are responsible for environmental health, safety and product regulatory compliance in addition to the standards, tools and services purchased from Dow. We have implemented a corporate audit program for all of our facilities. We expect that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and our industry in general. 
 Following the National Toxicology Program (“NTP”)’s classification of styrene as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”, the State of California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) has listed styrene as a substance "known to the State to cause cancer" under Proposition 65. Under Proposition 65, effective in 2017 manufacturers of products containing styrene that is sold in the state of California may have to provide warning if the styrene exposures associated with the use of their products are below the No Significant Risk Level (“NSRL”) for styrene. Polystyrene is excluded from the rule. Trinseo has determined that a warning is not required for its products since it is under the proposed NSRL. Additionally, styrene monomer is considered to have low toxicity and is not classified as a carcinogen or mutagen in the EU Nations. We have not seen a significant shift in customer demand away from styrenics products. We believe that there are no simple substitutes for our products that can deliver the same performance, quality, safety and cost effectiveness as the current set of products our customers buy from us. 
 There has been controversy for a number of years regarding the safety of BPA. However, we have not seen a material impact on our products or manufacturing operations. After several years of study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to reaffirm that BPA is safe at the current levels occurring in foods. Similarly, the European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”) has concluded there is no consumer health risk from Bisphenol A exposure.
 Sustainability and Climate Change 
 Our July 2016 Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which is available on our website, provides our most recent sustainability highlights for our products, performance and operations. The report also profiles how our products help our customers improve their own sustainability in areas such as LED lighting, green tires, building insulation, smart meters, life-saving medical devices, and lighter weight vehicles. Also in this report, the company tracks its greenhouse gas emissions and works to improve its performance at reducing chemical emissions and energy consumption.

 Chemical Registration 
 Trinseo is subject to a growing number of chemical regulation requirements globally. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (“LCSA”) was enacted in 2016 and modernized the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). The LSCA provides United States chemical manufacturers, processors importers, and downstream users of the chemistries with multiple opportunities to provide input to the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and allows the EPA to request further information on chemicals. TSCA, as revised by the LCSA, requires EPA to assess chemicals using a risk based approach and requires unreasonable risks to be mitigated. We actively monitor the progress of these and other legislative developments, and anticipate TSCA reforms this year.
 Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”), the regulatory system for chemicals management in the EU, requires EU manufacturers and importers to disclose information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by the European Chemicals Agency. We have completed the REACH requirements for registration of high-volume and high-hazard substances that we manufacture in or import into Europe and we are currently on track to complete the remaining implementation requirements by the deadline in 2018. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation similar to REACH, including China, Japan and Korea. 
 We do not expect that the costs to comply with TSCA, REACH and similar requirements will be material to our operations and consolidated financial position. We currently do not expect to need to register additional chemicals under REACH until 2018, at which time we will be required to register our low volume chemicals.
 Environmental Proceedings 
 Prior to our separation from Dow, the EPA conducted a multimedia investigation at Dow’s Midland, Michigan sites, including the ABS site that we now operate. The investigation uncovered a number of alleged violations, including of the Clean Air Act’s leak detection and repair program (“LDAR”). LDAR requires chemical and petroleum companies to control fugitive (i.e., non-point source) emissions of hazardous air pollutants that occur from valves, pumps, flanges, connectors and other piping components. We, Dow and the United States executed a consent decree, which was approved by the District Court in Michigan in 2011. The decree provides that Dow will implement an enhanced LDAR program at our ABS facility over a five year period, which is intended to further reduce fugitive emissions at the ABS facility. We are not a defendant in the action, but under the decree, we or any future owner of the affected equipment will be responsible for performing an enhanced LDAR program at the ABS facility should Dow fail to perform. The consent decree obligations have been fulfilled and Dow has requested the EPA to terminate the consent decree. Environmental Remediation 
 Environmental laws and regulations require mitigation or remediation of the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances. Under some of these regulations, as the current owner or operator of a property, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on or under the property, without regard to whether we knew of or caused the contamination, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were permitted at the time they occurred. At our Allyn’s Point, Connecticut property we lease a portion of the property to our joint venture, Americas Styrenics, for its operations, which includes a regulated hazardous waste boiler. Potential liabilities resulting from our owner status are addressed through financial assurance mechanisms and other agreements. Many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use, and it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future. Soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of the sites, and might occur or be discovered at other sites. Subject to certain monetary and temporal limitations, Dow is obligated to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to releases of hazardous material that existed at our sites prior to our separation from Dow in June 2010. However, we cannot be certain that Dow will fully honor the indemnity or that the indemnity will be sufficient to satisfy all claims that we may incur. In addition, we face the risk that future claims might fall outside of the scope of the indemnity, particularly if we experience a release of hazardous materials that occurs in the future or at any time after our separation from Dow. Except for minor monitoring activities that we are performing in Livorno, Italy pursuant to an agreement with Dow, we do not currently have any material obligations to perform environmental remediation on our properties, and any active remedial projects on our properties are being performed by Dow pursuant to its indemnification obligations or for any Superfund sites.

 Facility Security 
 We recognize the importance of security and safety to our employees and the community. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of technology), and emergency response preparedness into integrated security plans. We have conducted vulnerability assessments at our operating facilities in the U.S. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber-attacks. Effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at our manufacturing facilities will continue to be required to comply with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and other requirements. Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,197 employees worldwide. Nearly 78% of our personnel are located at the various manufacturing sites, research and development, pilot coating, paper fabrication and testing and technology centers. The remaining employees are located at operating centers, virtual locations or geographically dispersed marketing and sales locations. Our Midland, Michigan site is the only U.S. facility with union representation for its approximately 58 hourly operations personnel, and employees at certain of our locations are represented by work councils. We consider relations with our personnel and the various labor organizations to be good. There have been no labor strikes or work stoppages in these locations in recent history. Available Information
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website, www.trinseo.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed or furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We provide this website and the information contained in or connected to it for informational purposes only. That information is not part of this Annual Report.
