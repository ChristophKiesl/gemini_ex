Item 1.  Business.
Overview
Carlisle Companies Incorporated (“Carlisle”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a diversified, global manufacturer of highly engineered products. Our Company website is www.carlisle.com, through which we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All references to "Notes" refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Business Strategy
We strive to be the market leader of highly engineered products in the various markets we serve. Under Vision 2025, our key pillars include: dedication to driving above market growth, utilizing the Carlisle Operating System (“COS”) consistently to drive efficiencies and operating leverage, building scale with synergistic acquisitions, continuing to invest in and develop exceptional talent, accommodate continued organic growth through capital expenditures, and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
We utilize COS, an operating structure and strategy deployment system based on lean enterprise and six sigma principles, to drive improving operational performance. COS is a continuous improvement process that defines the way we do business. Waste is eliminated and efficiencies are improved enterprise wide, allowing us to increase overall profitability. Improvements are not limited to production areas, as COS is also driving improvements in new product innovation, engineering, supply chain management, warranty and product rationalization. COS has created a culture of continuous improvement across all aspects of our business operations.
While the coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19") has affected our near-term results, we believe our proactive approach to cost reductions and continuous improvement initiatives will allow us to accelerate through the recovery by: further improving the efficiency of our businesses through COS, continuing to make the investments necessary to deliver a world-class Carlisle Experience, which delivers the right product, at the right place, at the right time, and ensuring we maintain discipline and rigor in our capital allocation process. Taken together, we believe these actions will drive us to achieve our goals outlined in Vision 2025. See Description of Business by Segment below for a more detailed discussion of our Vision 2025 strategy. 
As noted above, a significant part of our strategy is to build scale with synergistic acquisitions. Synergies considered in making an acquisition include consolidation opportunities (e.g., footprint, back office, technology, systems), supply chain savings and cross-sell opportunities. We acquired two businesses during 2020, which add to our existing Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”), Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT”) and Carlisle Fluid Technologies ("CFT") segments. For more details regarding acquisitions of the Company’s businesses during the past three years, refer to Note 3.
We also pursue the sale of a business when it is determined it no longer fits within the Company’s long-term goals or strategy. Accordingly, on March 20, 2018, we completed the sale of our Carlisle FoodService Products ("CFS") segment to The Jordan Company for $758.0 million (refer to Note 4).
Description of Business by Segment
Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”)
Products, Markets and Locations
The CCM segment has evolved from a supplier of the first single-ply ethylene propylene diene monomer (“EPDM”) roofing membranes in the early 1960s to today, where we deliver innovative, easy-to-install and energy-efficient solutions through the Carlisle Experience for customers who are creating the sustainable building of the future. CCM manufactures a complete range of building envelope products for commercial, industrial and residential buildings, including single-ply roofing, rigid foam insulations, spray polyurethane foam technologies, architectural metal, heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") hardware and sealants, below-grade waterproofing, and air and vapor barrier systems focused on the weatherproofing and thermal performance of the building envelope. CCM is a leading North American and European building products manufacturer offering a complete set of solutions and systems to aid in the design of efficient building envelope construction projects, backed by industry-leading warranties and a focus on green principles.
EPDM, thermoplastic polyolefin (“TPO”) and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) membrane and polyisocyanurate insulation are sold together in warranted systems or separately in non-warranted systems to the new construction, re-roofing and maintenance, general construction and industrial markets. These products are primarily sold under the SynTec, Versico, Weatherbond and Hunter Panels brands in the United States of America (“U.S.” or “United States”) and throughout the world, and EPDM membrane under the Resitrix and Hertalan brands primarily in Europe. The segment sells its expanded polystyrene for a variety of end markets, predominantly roofing and waterproofing through its Insulfoam brand. 
CCM operates manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States, its primary market, and in Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom ("U.K.") and Romania. The majority of CCM’s products are sold through a network of authorized sales representatives and distributors in the United States.
Key Raw Materials
Key raw materials for this segment include methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”), polyol, EPDM polymer, TPO polymer, carbon black and coated steel. These raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply. The vendor typically has multiple processing facilities for key raw materials that are single sourced.
Seasonality
Revenues and earnings for CCM have historically been higher in the second and third quarters due to increased construction activity during those periods from favorable weather conditions.
Market Factors
CCM serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2020 CCM's two largest customers represented 32.1% of this segment’s revenues and 22.6% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s revenues and operating income and the Company's consolidated revenues and operating income. 
This segment faces competition from numerous competitors that produce roofing, insulation and waterproofing products for commercial and residential applications. The level of competition within this market varies by product line and region. As one of four major manufacturers in the single-ply industry, CCM competes through innovative products, long-term warranties and customer service. CCM offers separately priced extended warranty contracts on certain of its products ranging from five to 40 years, the most significant being those offered on its installed single-ply roofing systems primarily in the United States, subject to certain exclusions, that covers leaks in the roofing system attributable to a problem with the particular product or the installation of the product. The building owner must have the roofing system installed by an independent authorized roofing contractor trained by CCM to install its roofing systems in order to qualify for the warranty.
Vision 2025 Strategy
Our strategy under Vision 2025 for the CCM segment is to:
•Improve upon its above average margin profile;

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Carlisle has pledged to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected. In May 2018, Carlisle joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™, a growing coalition of more than 900 CEOs of major corporations pledging to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. By signing on to this commitment, Carlisle is pledging to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected. CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ is cultivating a new type of ecosystem centered around collaboration and sharing.
Carlisle’s commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workforce includes a policy of non-discriminatory treatment and respect of human rights for all current and prospective employees. Discrimination on the basis of an individual’s race, religion, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, national origin or veteran’s status is not permitted by Carlisle and is illegal in many jurisdictions. Carlisle respects the human rights of all employees and strives to treat them with dignity consistent with standards and practices recognized by the international community. Carlisle is committed to respecting all human rights, as articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
In addition to policies for fair treatment, Carlisle also works to address unconscious bias in the workplace. Unconscious bias training is a key component of Carlisle’s leadership development programs. This training helps inform leaders of biases and provides a forum for them to explore how Carlisle can strengthen our culture of inclusion by addressing and breaking down biases. This has contributed to an effort to gain equal diversity representation throughout Carlisle. 
Over a year ago, we began a significant initiative to ensure women and men are compensated fairly at Carlisle. As of the end of 2020, we achieved gender pay equity across the U.S. for executives, senior officers and management. In 2021, we will expand this initiative across the Company. This means compensating employees the same when they perform the same job duties, while accounting for other factors, such as their experience level, job performance and tenure with the company. In 2020, we raised Carlisle's minimum starting wage to $15 per hour for our entire U.S. workforce.
Below is a summary of our global employees diversity as of December 31, 2020 by gender and age:
Health and Safety
Carlisle is continuously striving to provide safer, healthier work environments. From the onset of COVID-19, Carlisle formed an internal task force to monitor and implement at all locations all of the health and safety guidelines and requirements of national and local authorities to protect our workforce, including, but not limited to, providing a period of full pay for employees required to follow stay-at-home orders and implementing remote work plans for eligible employees. Our task force met weekly with division management to ensure health and safety compliance in the workplace.
Through COS, we have launched “The Path to Zero,” an initiative to drive our incident rate to zero. At Carlisle, safety is everyone’s responsibility. This includes our own employees, as well as contractors, suppliers, customers and others. Carlisle is committed to adhere to safety policies, procedures, and training to incorporate safety into all aspects of business operations. All safety incidents are investigated to reduce safety risks and share lessons learned. Carlisle measures and reviews safety performance and strives for continuous improvement along the Path to Zero.
