Overview
Perficient is a global digital consultancy transforming how the world’s biggest brands connect with customers and grow their businesses. Our work enables clients to deliver experiences that surpass customer expectations; become more human-centered, authentic, and trusted; innovate through digital technologies; outpace competition; grow and strengthen relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners; and reduce costs. 
To articulate the full scope of our capabilities to clients and prospects, we go to market with six primary service categories: 
•Strategy and Consulting;
•Data and Intelligence;
•Platforms and Technology;
•Customer Experience and Digital Marketing;
•Innovation and Product Development; and
•Optimized Global Delivery.
Together, these service categories showcase our full end-to-end digital solutions, and individually each demonstrates our specialized capabilities. Within each category, and collectively, we deliver a deep and broad portfolio of solutions that enable our clients to operate a real-time enterprise that dynamically adapts business processes and the systems that support them to meet the changing demands of a global, Internet-driven, and competitive marketplace.
Through our experience in developing and delivering solutions for our clients, we believe we have acquired domain expertise that differentiates our firm. We use project teams that deliver high-value, measurable results by working collaboratively with clients and their partners through a user-centered, technology-based, and business-driven solutions methodology. We believe this approach enhances return on investment for our clients by reducing the time and risk associated with designing and implementing technology solutions.
We serve our Global 2000 and other large enterprise clients from locations in multiple markets throughout North America and through domestic, nearshore, and offshore delivery centers by leveraging an experienced sales team that is connected through a common service portfolio, sales process, and performance management system. Our sales process utilizes project pursuit teams that include those colleagues best suited to address a particular prospective client’s needs. Our primary target client base includes companies in North America with annual revenues in excess of one billion dollars. We believe this market segment can generate the repeat business that is a fundamental part of our growth plan. We primarily pursue solutions opportunities where our domain expertise and delivery track record give us a competitive advantage.
In 2020, we continued to implement a strategy focused on: 
•expanding our relationships with existing and new clients; 
•continuing to make disciplined acquisitions by acquiring substantially all of the assets of MedTouch LLC (“MedTouch”) in January 2020 as well as those of Catalyst Networks, Inc., a corporation doing business as Brainjocks (“Brainjocks”) in March 2020;
•strengthening our global delivery capabilities with the strategic acquisition of nearshore software development firm Productora de Software S.A.S. (“PSL”), based in Medellin, Colombia, with additional locations in Bogota and Cali, Colombia, in June 2020, expanding our presence in Latin America; 
•delivering solutions via our offshore capabilities in India, China, and Eastern Europe; and 
•leveraging our existing (and pursuing new) strategic alliances by targeting leading business advisory companies and technology providers. 
We have been able to extend or enhance our presence in certain markets through acquisitions, as well as expand or enhance the services and solutions we are able to provide our clients. Our acquisition of MedTouch in January 2020 enhanced and expanded the Company’s healthcare industry expertise and digital marketing capabilities while our acquisition of Brainjocks in March 2020 strengthened our Sitecore consulting and marketing technology capabilities. Our acquisition of PSL in June 2020 strengthened our global delivery capabilities, enhancing nearshore systems and custom software application development, testing, and ongoing support for clients, ensuring they have the right people in the right place at the right time.
We provide services primarily to these markets: healthcare, financial services (including banking and insurance), manufacturing, automotive, consumer markets, telecommunications, energy and utilities, and life sciences.
Approximately 98% of our revenues were derived from clients in the United States during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Approximately 88% and 93% of our total assets were located in the United States as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the remainder located in India, Colombia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and Serbia.

Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths include:
•Domain Expertise. We have developed significant domain expertise in a core set of technology solutions and software platforms. These solutions include custom applications, management consulting, analytics, commerce, content management, business integration, portals and collaboration, customer relationship management, business process management, and platform implementations. The platforms with which we have significant domain expertise and on which these solutions are built include IBM and Red Hat, Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Sitecore and Salesforce.
•Industry Expertise. We serve many of the world’s largest and most-respected brands with extensive business process experience across a variety of markets. These markets include healthcare (including pharma and life sciences), financial services (including banking and insurance), consumer markets (including retail and consumer goods), manufacturing, automotive and transportation, electronics and computer hardware, telecommunications, business services, energy and utilities, and leisure, media, and entertainment.
•Delivery Model and Methodology. Our significant domain expertise enables us to provide high-value solutions through project teams that deliver measurable results by working collaboratively with clients through a user-centered, technology-based, and business-driven solutions methodology. Our methodology includes a proven execution process map we developed, which allows for repeatable, high-quality services delivery. The methodology leverages the thought leadership of our senior strategists and practitioners to support the client project team and focuses on transforming our clients’ business processes to provide enhanced customer value and operating efficiency, enabled by web technology. As a result, we are able to offer our clients the dedicated attention that small firms usually provide, combined with the delivery and project management that larger firms usually offer.
•“Instant Insights” Platform: We leverage our “Instant Insights” platform to capture and react to customer feedback throughout project lifecycles, at scale. Instant Insights automates the solicitation and capturing of confidential customer feedback and disseminates it to the proper leadership and executive teams. This proprietary process and tool enables us to quickly address client concerns and strengthen the customer relationship in the process.
•Client Relationships. We have built a track record of quality solutions and client satisfaction through the timely, efficient, and successful completion of numerous projects. As a result, we have established long-term relationships with many clients that continue to engage us for additional projects and serve as references for us. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 94%, 91% and 93%, respectively, of services revenues were derived from clients that continued to utilize our services from the prior year, excluding any revenues from acquisitions completed in that year.
•Vendor Relationship and Endorsements. We have built meaningful relationships with software providers, whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients. These relationships enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners’ marketing efforts and endorsements. We also serve as a sales channel for our partners, helping them market and sell their software products. We are an IBM Platinum Business Partner, a Microsoft National Solutions Provider and Global NSP Partner, an Oracle Platinum Partner, an Adobe Platinum Partner, a Salesforce Consulting Partner, and a Sitecore Platinum Solution Partner.
•Offshore Delivery. In addition to serving our clients from locations in multiple markets throughout North America, we operate global development centers in India, China, and Eastern Europe. These facilities are staffed with 
colleagues who have specializations that include application development, adapter and interface development, quality assurance and testing, monitoring and support, product development, platform migration, and portal development with expertise in IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Sitecore, Magento, and other technologies. As of December 31, 2020, we had 958 colleagues at our India facilities, 131 colleagues at our China facility, and 23 colleagues at our Serbia office. We intend to continue to leverage our existing offshore capabilities, especially in India, to support our growth and provide our clients flexible options for project delivery.
•Nearshore Delivery. Our nearshore delivery team, based in Colombia, helps our clients lower costs while maintaining the highest quality. This team provides custom application and software development with proven experience in complex, cloud-native product development, leveraging cutting-edge software engineering technologies and practices around: DevOps, artificial intelligence/machine learning, test automation, UX/UI, cloud architecture design and implementation, blockchain, analytics, big data/fast data, chatbots and voice recognition system processing, modern scalable platforms, mobile, and performance engineering. As of December 31, 2020, we had 642 colleagues at our Colombia offices.
•Domestic Delivery. The Company maintains a domestic delivery center (the “LDC”) in Lafayette, Louisiana.

With the addition of the LDC, we have increased capabilities and improved service levels that cover the entire spectrum of the software development lifecycle. As of December 31, 2020, we had 66 colleagues at the LDC.
Competition
The market for the services we provide is competitive and has low barriers to entry. We believe that our competitors fall into several categories, including:
•small local consulting firms that operate in no more than one or two geographic regions;
•boutique consulting firms;
•national consulting firms, such as Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, EPAM Systems, Globant, and Endava;
•digital consulting firms/entities such as Accenture Interactive, Deloitte Digital, Publicis Sapient, and Computer Task Group;
•in-house professional services organizations of software companies; and
•offshore providers, such as Infosys Technologies Limited, Cognizant, and Wipro Limited.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include domain expertise, track record and customer references, partner network with leading technology companies, quality of proposed solutions, service quality and performance, efficiency, reliability, scalability and features of the software platforms upon which the solutions are based, and the ability to implement solutions quickly and respond on a timely basis to customer needs. In addition, because of the relatively low barriers to entry into this market, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. We expect competition from offshore outsourcing and development companies to continue.
Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater name recognition, and possess significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to attract clients to which we market our services and adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer or industry requirements.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,277 employees, 3,628 of which were billable (excluding 256 billable subcontractors) and 649 of which were involved in sales, administration, and marketing. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We are committed to the continued development of our employees.
Sales and Marketing. As of December 31, 2020, we had a 122-person direct solutions-oriented sales force. We reward our sales force for developing and maintaining relationships with our clients, seeking follow-up engagements, and leveraging those relationships to forge new relationships in different areas of the business and with our clients’ business partners. In addition to our direct sales team, we also have 70 dedicated sales support employees, 31 general managers and 7 vice-presidents who are engaged in our sales and marketing efforts.
We have sales and marketing partnerships with software vendors including IBM and Red Hat, Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Sitecore and Salesforce. These companies are key vendors of open standards-based software commonly referred to as middleware application servers, enterprise application integration platforms, business process management, cloud computing applications, business activity monitoring and business intelligence applications, and enterprise portal server software. Our direct sales force works in tandem with the sales and marketing groups of our partners to identify potential new clients and projects. Our partnerships with these companies enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners’ marketing efforts and endorsements.
Talent Acquisition. We are dedicated to hiring, developing, and retaining experienced, motivated technology professionals who combine a depth of understanding of current Internet and legacy technologies with the ability to implement complex and cutting-edge solutions. We believe in an employee-centered environment that is built on a culture of respect.
Retention. We firmly believe in the power of partnership and the spirit of innovation and approach every opportunity with these philosophies in mind. We focus on a core set of digital experience, business optimization, and industry solutions, applications, and software platforms and believe our commitment to our employees’ career development through continued training and advancement opportunities sets us apart as an employer of choice.
Utilization. We continually assess employee utilization, which is defined as the percentage of our professionals’ time billed to clients divided by the total available hours in the respective period. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed and our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our employee utilization was 78% compared to 77% in the prior year.
Compensation. Our compensation philosophy and programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees based on performance and results. Our tiered incentive compensation plans help us reach our overall goals by rewarding individuals for their influence on key performance factors and allow for differentiation so that truly stellar performers may be rewarded.
