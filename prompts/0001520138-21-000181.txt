Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Brazil Minerals, Inc. 
 with its subsidiaries (“Brazil Minerals”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a mineral exploration company currently primarily focused on the development of its two 100%-owned hard-rock lithium projects. Our initial goal is to be able to enter commercial production of spodumene concentrate, a lithium bearing commodity.
 
We also have 100%-ownership of projects in other highly strategic minerals: rare earths, titanium, and nickel/cobalt. We have mining concessions and other mineral rights for alluvial gold and diamonds and in one of these areas we also mine and sell sand for construction usage, which currently is our primary revenue producer.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), we own approximately 60% of Apollo Resources Corporation, a private company currently primarily focused on the development of its initial iron mine. We own 30% of Jupiter Gold Corporation, a company focused on the development of gold projects and of a quartzite mine, and whose common shares are quoted on otcmarkets.com under the symbol “JUPGF”.
 
We have consolidated our results as of December 31, 2020 in this Annual Report. All of our mineral properties are in Brazil. Our common shares are quoted on otcmarkets.com under the symbol “BMIX”.
 
Markets
 
In 2020, we increased our transition the development of mining sites for gold and diamond to the exploration of recently acquired mineral rights for strategic minerals, including lithium, rare earths, titanium, nickel, and cobalt. We believe that strategic minerals give us a higher return potential, particularly because such minerals are scarce and in demand, in particular for high growth areas such as batteries for electric vehicles and other high technology applications.
Lithium
 
Lithium is on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018.
 
The only lithium production in the United States is from a brine operation in Nevada. Two companies produce a wide range of downstream lithium compounds in the United States from domestic or imported lithium carbonate, lithium chloride, and lithium hydroxide. Although lithium markets vary by location, the top global end-use markets are estimated as follows: 71% for batteries and 14% for ceramics and glass. Lithium consumption for batteries has increased significantly in recent years because rechargeable lithium batteries are used extensively in the growing market for portable electronic devices and increasingly are used in electric tools, electric vehicles, and grid storage applications. Lithium minerals were used directly as ore concentrates in ceramics and glass applications.
 
Lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies in the United States and Asia. Strategic alliances and joint ventures among technology companies and exploration companies continued to be established to ensure a reliable, diversified supply of lithium for battery suppliers and vehicle manufacturers.

Rare Earths
 
The rare earth elements (“REE”) are also on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018.
 
REEs consist of the lanthanide series (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium) as well as scandium and yttrium.


REEs are classified as light and heavy based on atomic number. Light REEs (LREEs): lanthanum through gadolinium (atomic numbers 57 through 64). Heavy REEs (HREEs): terbium through lutetium (atomic numbers 65 through 71) and yttrium (atomic number 39), which has similar chemical and physical attributes with the other heavy REEs.
 
Neodymium and praseodymium (LREEs) are key critical materials in the manufacturing of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets. NdFeB magnets have the highest magnetic strength (energy product) among commercially available magnets and enable high energy density and high energy efficiency in energy technologies. Dysprosium and terbium (HREEs) are key critical materials often added to the NdFeB alloy to increase the operating temperature of the magnets. HREEs tend to be less abundant and more expensive than LREEs. The deployment of energy technologies such as wind turbines and electric vehicles (EVs) could lead to imbalances of supply and demand for these key materials.

Titanium
 
Titanium is also on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018.
 
The electronics and automotive sectors offer an abundance of opportunities for the titanium metal market where its ability to withstand high temperatures and non-magnetic nature which prevents interference with data storage are fundamental. Regulations which emphasize the production of fuel-efficient vehicles should increase demand for titanium.

Nickel & Cobalt
 
Nickel and cobalt are key battery metals needed for the growth phase in electric vehicle (EV) production world-wide. Cobalt is also on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018.
 
The greater the amount of nickel and cobalt, the greater the energy density of an electric vehicle battery, a factor that contributes to the storage of more energy, according to its real weight. A practical example: vehicles whose batteries have a higher energy density can run more kilometers than a lower energy density.

Demand for Potential Products
 
We have received an unsolicited indication of interest from a potential buyer of spodumene concentrate. We expect the demand for our strategic minerals, once in production, to be facilitated by Brazil’s strong mining tradition and its substantial annual trade with China, the United States, and the European Union, all likely sources of buyers. We intend on utilizing intermediaries for sales as to focus on our core competencies of exploration and extraction.
Raw Materials
 
We do not have any material dependence on any raw materials or raw material supplier. All of the raw materials that we need are available from numerous suppliers and at market-driven prices.
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own or license any intellectual property which we consider to be material.

Government Regulation
 
Mining Regulation and Compliance
 
Mining regulation in Brazil is carried out by the mining department, a federal entity, and each state in Brazil has an office of this federal entity. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the office of the mining department in the state in which such mineral right is located. We believe that we maintain a good relationship with the mining department and that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.
 
The mining department normally inspects our operations once a year via an unannounced visit. We estimate that it costs us $5,000-$10,000 annually to maintain compliance with various mining regulations.
 
Environmental Regulation and Compliance
 
Environmental regulation in Brazil is carried out by a state-level agency, which may have multiple offices, one for each region of the state. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the local office of the environmental agency that has the applicable geographical jurisdiction.  We believe that we maintain a good relationship with the offices of the environmental agency and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.
 
The environmental agency normally inspects our operations once every one or two years which is the standard practice for companies in good standing. We estimate that it costs us $25,000-$50,000 annually to maintain compliance with various environmental regulations.
 
Surface disturbance from any open pit mining performed by us is in full compliance with our mining plan as approved the local regulatory agencies. We regularly recuperate areas that have been exploited. The current environmental regulations state that after all mining has ceased (however long that may take), there would still be five years of available time for any necessary recuperation to be performed. Our mining and recovery processing for diamonds and gold does not use any chemical products. Tests are conducted regularly and there are no records of groundwater contamination.
 

Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have 11 full-time employees. We also retain consultants to provide specific services deemed necessary. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
 
Form and Year of Organization & History to Date
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2011 under the name Flux Technologies, Corp. From inception until December 2012, we were focused in the software business, which was discontinued when the current management team and business focus began. The Company changed its name to Brazil Minerals, Inc. in December 2012.
