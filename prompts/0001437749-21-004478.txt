ITEM 1.    Business
Overview 
 Boyd Gaming Corporation (the "Company," the "Registrant," "Boyd Gaming," "we" or "us") is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company that has been in operation since 1975. Headquartered in Las Vegas, we operate 28 wholly owned gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 
We strive to create long-term shareholder value, to be among the leading companies in our industry and to provide opportunities for all while we support and enhance our communities. Our primary areas of focus are: (i) ensuring our existing operations are managed as efficiently as possible and remain positioned for growth; (ii) improving our capital structure and strengthening our balance sheet, including paying down debt, increasing free cash flow, improving operations and diversifying our asset base; and (iii) successfully pursuing our growth strategy, which is built on identifying development opportunities and acquiring assets that are a good strategic fit and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders.
 
We operate with an efficient business model that we believe has enabled us to grow operating margins over the past several years, and we believe we have an opportunity to realize additional cost savings by further leveraging our size and scale. We strategically reinvest in our non-gaming amenities, including hotel rooms and restaurants to refresh our property offerings and better capitalize on customers' evolving spending behaviors. We manage our cost and expense structure to adjust to current business volumes and to generate strong and stable cash flows.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, all of our gaming facilities were closed in mid-March 2020 in compliance with orders issued by state officials as precautionary measures intended to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. As of February 22, 2021, 26 of our 28 gaming facilities are open and operating, subject to various health and safety measures, including occupancy limitations. Two of our properties in Las Vegas remain closed to the public due to the current levels of demand in the market and our cost containment efforts. Two of our properties in the Midwest & South segment that had re-opened in the summer were temporarily closed again by state officials, one in November and the second in December 2020. These properties subsequently re-opened in January 2021. We cannot predict whether we will be required to temporarily close some or all of our re-opened casinos in the future. Further, we cannot currently predict the ongoing impact of the pandemic on consumer demand and the negative effects on our workforce, suppliers, contractors and other partners. In responding to these circumstances, the safety and well-being of our team members and customers is our utmost priority. We have developed and implemented a broad range of safety protocols at our properties to ensure the health and safety of our team members and our customers.
 
The closures of our properties had a material impact on our business, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated impacts on customer behavior and the requirements of health and safety protocols are expected to continue to have a material impact on our business. The severity and duration of such business impacts cannot currently be estimated and the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the economy and consumer behavior and demand, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in additional business disruptions, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We have taken significant measures in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including (i) reducing the offering of certain amenities (because such amenities must remain closed) and otherwise limiting the availability of certain offerings, such as deactivating a substantial number of gaming devices to maintain social distancing and substantially limiting restaurant seating, as well as substantially limiting the number of customers permitted to be in a property at any time; (ii) adjusting property and corporate staffing levels in response to operational refinements and business volumes present as we re-opened our properties; and (iii) suspending our quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase programs. 
 
On May 8, 2020, we amended the Boyd Credit Agreement to, among other things, waive the financial covenants for the period beginning on March 30, 2020 through the earlier of (x) the date on which the Company delivers to the administrative agent a covenant relief period termination notice, (y) the date on which the administrative agent receives a compliance certificate with respect to the Company’s fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, and (z) the date on which the Company fails to satisfy the conditions to covenant relief set forth in the amendment. On May 21, 2020, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due 2025 to further increase our cash position. In August 2020, the Company further amended the Boyd Credit Agreement to increase the Revolving Credit Facility capacity by $88.2 million and extend the Revolving Credit Facility and Term A Loan to September 2023. 
 
We currently anticipate funding our operations over the next 12 months with the cash being generated by our re-opened properties, supplemented, if necessary, by the cash we currently have available and the borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility. We assessed the recoverability of our assets as of the end of first quarter considering our then current expectations of the timing of re-openings and the expected level of operations to be achieved post re-opening. Based on this review, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $171.1 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our conclusions based on our reviews as of the end of second quarter and third quarter of 2020 were that no additional impairment charges were required. Based on our annual review, an additional $3.6 million impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. If our expectations regarding projected revenues and cash flows related to our assets are not achieved, we may be subject to additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
  1 



We continually work to position our Company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through acquisitions, capital investments and other strategic initiatives. An example is our recent strategic initiative regarding legalized sports gambling. In July 2018, the Company entered into a partnership agreement with MGM Resorts International ("MGM Resorts"). Under this partnership, MGM Resorts and Boyd Gaming both have the opportunity to offer online and mobile gaming platforms, including sports betting, casino gaming and poker in jurisdictions where either company operates physical casino resorts and online licenses are available. We have entered into agreements under this partnership for online offerings to be launched in 2021 in Indiana and Iowa. In August 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership with FanDuel Group to pursue sports betting and online gaming opportunities across the United States. Also in August 2018, we opened sports books at our two Mississippi properties, IP Casino Resort Spa ("IP") in Biloxi, and Sam's Town Hotel & Gambling Hall in Tunica, following the receipt of final approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. In March 2019, Valley Forge opened a sports book at the facility and in third quarter 2019, sports books at Diamond Jo Worth, Diamond Jo Dubuque, Blue Chip and Belterra Casino Resort opened, following approval from the respective state regulatory bodies. In August 2020, Par-A-Dice opened a sports book at the property. We plan to further expand our online gaming presence with the launch of a Stardust-branded iCasino in Pennsylvania in April 2021, pending regulatory approval.
 
We believe that the following factors have contributed to our success in the past and are central to our success in the future:
 

• | our operations are geographically diversified within the United States; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | eight of our Las Vegas properties are well-positioned to capitalize on the attractive Las Vegas locals market; 
• | our three downtown Las Vegas properties focus a majority of their marketing programs on, and derive a majority of their revenues from, a unique niche - Hawaiian customers;
• | we have strengthened our balance sheet and have increased free cash flow; 
• | we have the ability to expand certain existing properties and to act opportunistically to make strategic acquisitions; and 
• | we have an experienced management team. 

Properties 
 As of December 31, 2020, we own and operate 28 properties offering a total of 1,759,674 square feet of casino space, 35,023 slot machines, 804 table games and 11,087 hotel rooms. We derive the majority of our revenues from our gaming operations, which generated approximately 81%, 75% and 73% of our revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Food & beverage revenues represent our next most significant revenue source, generating approximately 8%, 13% and 14% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Room revenues and other revenues each contributed less than 10% of revenues during each year.
 
We view each operating property as an operating segment. For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our properties into three reportable business segments: (i) Las Vegas Locals; (ii) Downtown Las Vegas; and (iii) Midwest & South.
 
We added five properties to our Midwest & South segment during 2018. Valley Forge was acquired on September 17, 2018 and Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Resort and Belterra Park were acquired on October 15, 2018. In December 2020, we sold Eldorado Casino, which was part of our Las Vegas Locals segment. As a result of the sale in 2016 of our equity interest in Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa ("Borgata"), we report our interest in Borgata as discontinued operations. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of these activities.
 
For financial information related to our segments as of and for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, see Note 14, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8.

As a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, each state has enacted certain restrictions regarding services provided and capacity limitations. These restrictions have impacted each of our properties and have led to reduced numbers of gaming positions, the closure of certain non-gaming amenities, reduced seating capacity in bars and restaurants and limited operational hours. The Company is re-evaluating the configuration of the casino floors, including the number of slot machines and table games present on the floor, in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on the business environment. The number of these amenities may be reduced as a result of these evaluations.
 
Las Vegas Locals Properties
 Our Las Vegas Locals segment consists of eight casinos that primarily serve the resident population of the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Las Vegas has historically been characterized by a vibrant economy and strong demographics that include a large population of retirees and other active gaming customers. In recent years, the Las Vegas economy has strengthened, as reflected in the positive trends in employment, construction activity and visitation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there has been a downturn in the economy as visitation has declined and capacity limitations have been in place since the properties re-opened. Our Las Vegas Locals segment competes directly with other locals casinos and gaming companies, some of which operate larger casinos and offer different promotions than ours.

Downtown Las Vegas Properties 
 Our three Downtown Las Vegas properties directly compete with nine other casinos that operate in downtown Las Vegas. As such, we have developed a distinct niche for our downtown properties by focusing on customers from Hawaii. Our downtown properties focus their marketing on gaming enthusiasts from Hawaii and tour and travel agents in Hawaii with whom we have cultivated relationships since we opened our California Hotel and Casino (the "Cal") in 1975. Through our Hawaiian travel agency, Vacations Hawaii, we operate flights from Honolulu to Las Vegas each week, helping to provide air transportation for our customers. In March 2020, as a result of COVID-19, the charter flights from Honolulu to Las Vegas were paused and are expected to resume in mid-2021. We also have strong, informal relationships with other Hawaiian travel agencies and offer affordable all-inclusive packages. These relationships, combined with our Hawaiian promotions, have allowed the Cal, Fremont Hotel and Casino ("Fremont") and Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel ("Main Street Station") to capture a significant share of the Hawaiian tourist trade in Las Vegas. During the year ended December 31, 2020, patrons from Hawaii comprised approximately 43% of the occupied room nights at the Cal, 19% of the occupied room nights at Fremont, and 47% of the occupied room nights at Main Street Station.
 
California Hotel and Casino 
 The Cal's amenities include 779 hotel rooms, multiple dining options, a sports book, and meeting space. The Cal and Main Street Station are connected by an indoor pedestrian bridge.
Fremont Hotel and Casino

In addition, Main Street Station features a 96-space recreational vehicle park, the only such facility in the downtown area.

Competition
 Our properties generally operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality, entertainment and leisure companies. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including Native American casinos, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects.
Strategic Initiatives
 BoydPay Digital Wallet
 In February 2021, the Company and Aristocrat Technologies announced the launch of "BoydPay," our new digital wallet product. Through BoydPay, our customers will have the ability to create a cashless digital wallet that can be conveniently linked to third-party funding sources driven by Sightline Payments. BoydPay is currently in use at Blue Chip and Belterra Park and is in the trial phase at Aliante.
 
During its initial phase, the BoydPay digital wallet is linked to a player's B Connected card and used to play or cash out on slot titles, also in partnership with Aristocrat. Pending regulatory approvals, we anticipate deploying this product at all of our casino properties nationwide by this summer.
 
During future phases, and pending regulatory approval, we will utilize Aristocrat technology to link the BoydPay wallet to our B Connected Mobile app, creating a contactless experience that will allow customers to use their smartphones to play and cash out on casino games and pay for amenities throughout the property.
 
Launch of Stardust Social Casino
 During July 2020, the Company relaunched its iconic Stardust brand with the debut of the all-new Stardust Social Casino app.  Inspired by one of the most famous casinos in Las Vegas history, the Stardust Social Casino mobile app features a regularly updated selection of popular slot titles from Boyd Gaming casino floors across the country.  The game is free to play and is available for download on iOS and Android mobile platforms.  In addition to offering a wide selection of popular games, Stardust Social Casino also offers rewards and benefits at Boyd Gaming properties across the country.  Virtual credit purchases in the app earn points and Tier Credits within Boyd Gaming's B Connected player loyalty program, redeemable at Boyd Gaming properties across the country.
 
Strategic Partnership with FanDuel Group
 In August 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership with FanDuel Group ("FanDuel"), the largest online sports destination in the United States, to pursue sports betting and online gaming opportunities across the country and acquired a five percent equity ownership interest in FanDuel.

Subject to state law and regulatory approvals, we will establish a presence in the online gaming and sports wagering industry by leveraging FanDuel's technology and related services to operate Boyd Gaming-branded mobile and online sports-betting and gaming services. In turn, FanDuel will establish and operate mobile and online sports-betting and gaming services under the FanDuel brand in the states where we are licensed. During 2018, IP and Tunica opened sports books that are powered by FanDuel. During 2019, FanDuel sports books opened at our Valley Forge, Diamond Jo Worth, Diamond Jo Dubuque, Blue Chip and Belterra Resort properties. In 2020, a FanDuel sportsbook opened at our Par-A-Dice property. FanDuel currently offers online sportsbook in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Pennsylvania. We plan to launch a Stardust-branded iCasino in Pennsylvania in April 2021, pending regulatory approval.
 
Our relationship with FanDuel covers all states where we hold gaming licenses currently and in the future, excluding Nevada. It also covers states included under our market-access agreement with MGM Resorts. The two companies also engage in extensive co-branding and cross-promotional efforts. FanDuel markets our properties through its existing daily fantasy sports service and future interactive sports betting and gaming services, while we promote FanDuel's products to our customer base. FanDuel also provides our customers access to its existing product line.
 
Market-Access Agreement with MGM Resorts
 In July 2018, we and MGM Resorts announced a market-access agreement to significantly increase each company's market access and customer base throughout the United States. Under this arrangement, our Company and MGM Resorts both have the opportunity to offer online and mobile gaming platforms - including sports betting, casino gaming and poker - in jurisdictions where either company operates physical casino resorts and online licenses are available. Under this market access agreement, each company has a path to expand their online and mobile gaming presence across 15 states, allowing each company to leverage their scale to create a nationwide approach to online and mobile sports betting, real money casino gaming and poker. As states continue to legalize interactive gaming, both companies will be poised to offer products in mobile and online sports betting, real money casino gaming and poker products where legally applicable.
 
Acquisition of Lattner Entertainment Group
 To further diversify and expand our business, we acquired Lattner Entertainment Group Illinois, LLC ("Lattner"), in June 2018. The acquisition of Lattner provides us with an additional avenue to access gaming customers and a platform to participate in the expansion of distributed gaming.
Future Development Opportunities
 Development Agreement with Wilton Rancheria
 We have a development agreement and a management agreement with Wilton Rancheria, a federally-recognized Native American tribe located southeast of Sacramento, California, to develop and manage a gaming entertainment complex. In January 2017, Wilton Rancheria received a favorable Record of Decision from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and in February 2017, the land was taken into trust on behalf of the tribe. The land parcel taken into trust is located approximately 15 miles southeast of Sacramento on Highway 99, one of the two major north-south freeways in the Sacramento area. In September 2017, the California State Legislature unanimously approved, and the Governor of California executed, a tribal-state gaming compact with Wilton Rancheria allowing the development of the casino. In October 2018, the National Indian Gaming Commission ("NIGC") approved the Company's management contract with Wilton Rancheria. With the compact now in place and the design and project budget finalized, Wilton Rancheria has secured third-party financing to fund construction. Construction of the project is expected to begin in first quarter 2021, and it is expected to open in the second half of 2022. 
Frequent Player Loyalty Programs
 B Connected
 We have established a nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program. Our players use their "B Connected" cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our properties. The program has five player tiers - Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Onyx and Titanium. The "B Connected" club, among other benefits, rewards players for their loyalty as well as entitles them to qualify for promotions and earn rewards toward slot, video poker, or table games play.
 
Benefits for our loyal customers include annual cruises, vacations, and gifts of luxury jewelry and electronics. The B Connected program is currently available at all properties except for Eastside Cannery and Jokers Wild. Eastside Cannery is expected to fully implement the program after it re-opens. 
 
Other Promotional Activities
 We provide other promotional offers and discounts targeted towards new customers, frequent customers, inactive customers, customers of various levels of play, and prospective customers who have not yet visited our properties, and mid-week and other promotional activities that seek to generate visits to our properties during slower periods. Complementaries are usually in the form of monetary discounts, and other rewards generally can only be redeemed at our restaurants, retail and spa facilities.
Government Regulation
 We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. The states in which we operate empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and may require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
 
If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or not such legislation will be enacted. The federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and the elimination of betting on NCAA events. And with the recent expansion of sports wagering in various state jurisdictions, the federal government may elect to enact legislation taxing and regulating sports wagering, or alternatively may elect to prohibit such wagering. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.

Additionally, we have a formal, annual goal setting and performance review processes to drive engagement, performance and retention.
