Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a digital healthcare company redefining the way cardiac arrhythmias are clinically diagnosed by combining our wearable biosensing technology with cloud-based data analytics and deep-learning capabilities. Our goal is to be the leading provider of ambulatory electrocardiogram (“ECG”) monitoring for patients at risk for arrhythmias. We have created a full portfolio of ambulatory cardiac monitoring services on a unique platform, called the Zio service, which combines an easy-to-wear and unobtrusive biosensor that can be worn for up to 14 consecutive days with powerful proprietary algorithms that distill data from millions of heartbeats into clinically actionable information. We believe that the Zio service allows physicians to diagnose many arrhythmias more quickly and efficiently than traditional technologies and avoid multiple indeterminate tests. Early detection of heart rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation (“AF”) and other clinically relevant arrhythmias, allows for appropriate medical intervention and helps avoid more serious downstream medical events, including stroke. Since receiving clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2009, we have provided the Zio service to over three million patients and have collected over 750 million hours of curated heartbeat data, creating what we believe to be the world’s largest repository of ambulatory ECG patient data. This data provides us with a competitive advantage by informing our proprietary deep-learned algorithms, which may enable operating efficiencies, gross margin improvement and business scalability. We believe the Zio service is well aligned with the goals of the U.S. healthcare system: improving population health, enhancing the patient care experience, reducing per-capita cost, and improving the clinician experience.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 11 million patients in the United States have a heart rhythm disorder, or arrhythmia. The most common sustained type of arrhythmia is AF. The American Heart Association (“AHA”), estimates that as many as six million people in the United States have AF with at least one-third of these patients being asymptomatic at the time of their diagnosis. Individuals with AF are five times more likely to suffer a stroke; however, the National Stroke Association (“NSA”) estimates that up to 80% of strokes suffered by people with AF are preventable with early detection and proper treatment.
The ambulatory cardiac monitoring market is well-established with an estimated 5 million diagnostic tests performed annually in the United States, which we believe to be an existing $1.8 billion market opportunity for our Zio service. Traditional ambulatory cardiac monitoring tools used by physicians for diagnosing patients with suspected arrhythmias, such as Holter and cardiac event monitors, are constrained by one or more of the following: short prescribed monitoring times, non-continuous data collection and reporting, cumbersome equipment and low patient compliance. As an example of these traditional constraints, patients often remove these traditional monitors when sleeping, showering or exercising, leading to failure to capture critical data. These limitations contribute to incomplete diagnoses and repeat testing, which in turn result in suboptimal patient care and higher costs to the health system.
We believe the Zio service provides a comprehensive solution that addresses all of these limitations and offers a clear value proposition to patients, providers, and payors by providing an easy-to-use, clinically proven, cost-effective platform solution. Our Zio service is prescribed by physicians for both identifying arrhythmias as well as for identifying risk factors which may be associated with a previously-identified arrhythmia. It improves physician management and diagnosis of arrhythmias by providing a patient-friendly wearable biosensor, curating and analyzing voluminous uninterrupted continuous ECG data, and ultimately creating a concise report that is used by the physician to make a diagnosis that can be integrated into a patient’s electronic health record. We believe our Zio service can continue taking significant market share from the existing ambulatory cardiac monitoring market and expanding the market for new clinical use cases and indications. We believe the Zio service has the potential to supplant traditional technology and become the primary monitoring option for patients who are candidates for ambulatory cardiac monitoring due to its ability to detect more arrhythmias with a high degree of clinical accuracy, which allows for earlier changes in clinical patient management.
The Zio service consists of:
•wearable patch-based biosensors, Zio XT and Zio AT monitors, which continuously records and stores ECG data from every patient heartbeat for up to 14 consecutive days. Zio AT offers the option of timely transmission of data during the prescribed wear period;
•cloud-based analysis of the recorded cardiac rhythms using our proprietary, deep-learned algorithms;
•a final quality assessment review of the data by our certified cardiographic technicians;
•a scalable digital platform that includes an easy-to-read Zio report, which is a curated summary of findings that includes high-quality and clinically-actionable information which is sent directly to a patient’s physician and can be integrated into a patient’s electronic health record; and
•a proprietary cloud-based digital information system, ZioSuite, that allows clinicians to connect via a web browser or mobile application for convenient online report interpretation and streamlined clinical workflows. 
We refer to both the Zio AT monitor, and the Zio XT monitor herein as our Zio monitor(s), unless otherwise specified.
We have reviewed a body of clinical evidence which we interpret to show, among other advantages, that the Zio service helps reduce healthcare costs and improves arrhythmia detection, characterization and diagnosis by prescribing physicians. These improvements have the potential to change clinical management of patients. Our clinical evidence is helping to drive physician adoption. We interpreted one study of the Zio service, published in The American Journal of Cardiology in August 2013, to show that among 16,142 consecutive Zio service patients in whom an arrhythmia was detected, over 50% of symptomatic arrhythmias detected by the Zio service occurred more than 48 hours into the wear period. Although this study did not directly compare the Zio service to Holter monitoring performance, it should be noted that 48 hours is outside of the typical wear period for Holter monitors. Furthermore, an internal analysis of 500,000 consecutive Zio records concluded that the first incidence of certain critical arrhythmias, specifically ventricular tachycardia, pause, AV block and atrial fibrillation, occurred beyond 7 days in 22%, 18%, 16%, and 13% of patients, respectively. Based upon our review of another prospective comparative study against Holter monitor, published in The American Journal of Medicine in January 2014, we concluded that the Zio service detected 96 arrhythmia events compared to 61 arrhythmia events detected by the Holter monitor (P < 0.001), providing a 57% improvement in diagnostic yield, which is the percentage of patients in whom an arrhythmia was detected during the monitoring period. In summary, we interpreted the clinical results to show that the Zio service is preferred by patients and allows for significantly longer continuous monitoring, improved clinical accuracy, increased detection of arrhythmias by physicians, and meaningful changes in clinical management.
Over three million patients have utilized the Zio service since its commercialization, and as of December 31, 2020, we have achieved both policy coverage and, where applicable, contracts with the majority of payors in the United States including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and other government agencies. Over 95% of patients in the U.S. are able to access reimbursed Zio services through our third-party payor contracts, our IDTF participation status with CMS, and self-pay programs when excluding state Medicaid programs. We have designed a comprehensive strategy to allow us to compete favorably in the ambulatory cardiac monitoring market, which includes capturing market share from existing monitoring devices in the United States and international markets as well as expanding the market through new indications. We expect to drive sales and margin growth in our business by expanding our sales organization, securing additional contracts with commercial payors, maintaining technology leadership through research and development, and continuing to build clinical evidence supporting the benefits of the Zio service.
We have collected over 750 million hours of curated heartbeat data, creating what we believe to be the world’s largest repository of annotated, continuous ambulatory ECG recordings with contextual patient information. This extensive database, along with our proprietary analytic platform, differentiates the Zio service and gives us a competitive advantage. We will continue to seek opportunities to capitalize on our product design, proprietary analytic capabilities and data repository to capture additional opportunities in the digital healthcare market.
We are a vertically-integrated company headquartered in San Francisco, California, and we have additional commercial operations and facilities in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Houston, Texas, and the United Kingdom. We manufacture our devices in Cypress, California. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,157 full-time employees. Our revenue was $265.2 million and $214.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and we incurred a net loss of $43.8 million and $54.6 million for those same periods.
Market Opportunity
Every year, millions of patients experience symptoms potentially associated with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition in which the electrical impulses that coordinate heartbeats do not occur properly, causing the heart to beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Examples of arrhythmias include supra ventricular arrhythmias, which are fast heart rates that originate from the upper chambers of the heart, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter and AF. The symptoms of arrhythmias include palpitations or a skipped heartbeat, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, light-headedness, fainting spells, vertigo, anxiety and fatigue or no symptoms at all. Early detection is essential in order to obtain early treatment and help avoid more serious medical conditions, such as stroke, and additional medical costs.
Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke
In patients with AF, the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and blood does not flow properly to the lower chambers of the heart. The AHA estimates that AF affects as many as six million patients in the United States and 33.5 million patients worldwide. The NSA estimates that one-third of AF patients are asymptomatic and still undiagnosed. More than 750,000 hospitalizations occur each year because of AF, and the condition contributes to an estimated 130,000 deaths each year. Since AF is more common among people over the age of 60, these numbers are expected to increase as the U.S. population ages.
In addition, AF is the leading risk factor for stroke because AF can cause blood to collect in the heart and potentially form a clot, which can travel to the brain potentially resulting in an ischemic stroke. While individuals with AF are approximately five times more likely to suffer a stroke, the NSA estimates that up to 80% of strokes in people with AF can be prevented through early detection and proper treatment. According to the AHA, stroke costs the United States an estimated $34 billion each year in healthcare costs and lost productivity, and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. The AHA estimates that ischemic strokes represent 87% of all strokes in the United States and that between 15% and 20% of the estimated 690,000 ischemic strokes are attributable to AF.
Currently, the Zio service is prescribed by physicians primarily for symptomatic patients. However, we believe that high-risk asymptomatic patients represent an additional market opportunity for the Zio service. Monitoring high-risk asymptomatic patients may lead to increased diagnoses and earlier treatment and potentially avoid more severe downstream conditions, because, as the Framingham Study published in Stroke in September 1995 demonstrated, 18% of AF-related strokes present with asymptomatic AF that is only detected at the time of stroke.
Early detection of AF is critical in optimizing patient care, delivering earlier treatment to help avoid further adverse clinical events, managing symptoms caused by AF, and reducing the total public health burden of treating stroke. The AHA and American Stroke Association (“ASA”) have published treatment guidelines for patients diagnosed with AF to manage heart rhythm and rate and prevent stroke. These early treatments include:
•medications such as oral anticoagulants
•treatment with anti-arrhythmic drugs
•interventions such as cardiac ablation therapy to help control heart rhythm and rate
Atrial fibrillation burden, the amount of time a patient spends in AF during a monitoring period, has been identified in the clinical community as an important measure for determining appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions to manage patients with AF and assessing stroke risk. The calculated AF burden is only as good as the data available for analysis during the monitoring period. Since the most common type of AF occurs intermittently, long-term continuous patch-based monitoring, such as the Zio service, more accurately measures AF burden because every heartbeat is recorded without interruption during the entire monitoring period. A study to determine the correlation between AF burden, as measured by the Zio service, and the risk of stroke in patients was published in JAMA Cardiology in May 2018. Using this data in combination with electronic health record data from 1,965 patients at two large integrated health care delivery systems, the researchers concluded that an increase in the burden of AF is independently associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke and arterial thromboembolism (“TE”) in patients who are not taking anticoagulant medication. An AF burden of 11.4% or higher was associated with more than three-fold increased risk for stroke or TE event after adjusting for either CHA2DS2-VASc or ATRIA scores, two tools physicians use to assess stroke risk.
Ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring Overview
Arrhythmia symptoms are generally monitored either in a physician’s office or healthcare facility or remotely with the use of ambulatory cardiac monitoring devices. Typically, physicians will administer a resting ECG in their offices to record and analyze the electrical impulses of patients’ hearts. If physicians determine that patients require monitoring for a longer period of time to generate a diagnosis, they have historically prescribed an ambulatory cardiac monitoring device such as a Holter monitor. If the diagnosis is not definitive following the first monitoring period, physicians may prescribe a repeat Holter monitoring period, or alternatively, prescribe event monitors, mobile cardiac telemetry or implantable loop recorders. Physicians use frequency and acuity of symptoms to determine which monitoring device to prescribe. Some physicians own their own ambulatory cardiac monitoring devices and provide ambulatory monitoring services directly to their patients, while others outsource these services to third-party providers.
Holter Monitors
Holter monitors are non-invasive, ambulatory, battery-operated monitoring products that continuously record the ECG data of a patient, during a typical prescribed wear period of 24 to 48 hours. A Holter monitor consists of a recorder, electrodes that are attached to the patient’s chest and wires, or electrode leads, connecting the electrodes to the recorder. After the prescribed wear period, the data recorded by the device is delivered by hand, mail or internet for processing and analysis by the physician’s office or a third-party provider. Holter monitors are typically prescribed for patients who experience daily symptoms. For patients with suspected arrhythmias, Holter monitors have a relatively low diagnostic yield of approximately 24% due to a limited prescribed wear period of typically no more than 48 hours and low patient compliance, likely resulting from bulky equipment and cumbersome electrode leads. The low diagnostic yield is also attributable to missing data, because patients typically remove the electrodes and disconnect their Holter monitors in order to shower, sleep and exercise.
Cardiac Event Monitors and Mobile Cardiac Telemetry
Cardiac event monitoring is another type of non-invasive, ambulatory monitoring. Event monitoring differs from Holter monitoring in that the monitor is prescribed and worn for a longer period of time, up to 30 days, and the data recorded during the wear period are symptom driven. Event monitors generally record several minutes of activity at a time and then start over, a process referred to as memory loop recording. There are many types of event recorders available with a range of features including patient-triggered or auto-detected symptom recording, and manual data transmission or auto-send. Typically, physicians prescribe event monitors for patients with lower acuity symptoms. Mobile cardiac telemetry ("MCT"), is another form of event monitor that usually uses wireless technology, such as a cell phone network, to transmit event data during the wear period for both patient-triggered and auto-detected events to a monitoring facility where the ECG data is analyzed and the facility determines if physicians should be notified of significant events. Typically, physicians prescribe MCT for patients with higher acuity symptoms such as syncope, or fainting, that require more timely notification and actions.
Event and mobile cardiac monitors have several limitations, including limited data storage, the lack of trend data, and poor patient compliance due to electrode replacement, bulky equipment and the fact the patient must both activate and transmit events in some cases. Additionally, MCT technology has unique limitations including the need for patients to keep the transmitter close at all times and frequently change the battery or recharge the device to ensure timely transmissions as well as notifications sent to physicians of non-actionable events. These limitations can severely impact a physician’s ability to provide a timely diagnosis and result in a lower diagnostic yield. More recently, there have been new MCT products introduced to the market that include patch-based or combined recorder-transmitter features to try and address some of these limitations.
Implantable Loop Recorders
A separate segment of ambulatory cardiac monitoring consists of implantable diagnostic products such as implantable loop recorders, also known as insertable cardiac monitors. Implantable loop recorders are implanted underneath a patient’s skin during a hospital-based, minimally-invasive procedure. These devices remain implanted in a patient for up to three years, capturing data in a looping manner for patient-triggered or automatically-detected events. Limitations of this monitoring option include the semi-permanent nature of the implant, infection risks during insertion and removal, non-continuous data collection, under- or over-sensing which may exhaust the memory of the loop recorder, risk of missing events due to the looping nature of the recording, and the high cost of the device.
Limitations of Traditional Ambulatory Cardiac Monitors
Limitations of the various types of traditional ambulatory cardiac monitors can include the following:
•short prescribed monitoring periods leading to low diagnostic yield;
•non-continuous and interrupted data collection, resulting in an incomplete picture of a patient’s arrhythmia experience;
•bulky monitoring equipment with dangling electrode leads causing discomfort and low patient compliance;
•the need to use multiple, often times costly, diagnostic options that would not be necessary if initial tests had produced a higher diagnostic yield;
•the generation of excessive and uncurated data for the physician to analyze; and
•over notification of non-actionable events.
We believe there is a significant opportunity for a disruptive arrhythmia monitoring solution that offers a portfolio of ambulatory cardiac monitoring services on a single platform that is cost effective and provides certainty in a single test obtained through uninterrupted continuous monitoring, combined with patient-friendly design, to enhance compliance and simplify the monitoring experience while maximizing diagnostic yield.
Our Solution
We have developed an uninterrupted, long-term continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring platform known as the Zio service that provides continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring through both the Zio XT monitor and Zio AT monitor. The FDA-cleared and CE-marked Zio service combines a wire-free, patch-based, 14-day wearable biosensor with a proprietary cloud-based data analytic platform to help physicians monitor patients and diagnose arrhythmias with a high degree of accuracy and confidence. Since commercialization, over three million patients have utilized the Zio service, and we have collected over 750 million hours of heartbeats, creating what we believe to be the world’s largest repository of curated ambulatory ECG patient data.
While wearing either the Zio XT or Zio AT monitor, patients have the ability to mark when symptoms occur by pressing a trigger button on the device, and separately recording contextual data like activities and circumstances in a written symptom diary or digitally via the myZio application. This allows physicians to match symptoms and activity with ECG data. Following the wear period, the monitor is returned and data are uploaded to our secure cloud and run through our proprietary, deep-learned algorithms. A concise report of preliminary findings is prepared by our certified cardiographic technicians and made available on our proprietary cloud-based portal, ZioSuite, that allows clinicians to connect via a web browser or mobile application. Zio AT offers the additional capability of actionable transmissions during the wear period to assist physicians in diagnosing and treating the small percentage of the population requiring more timely action. During the Zio AT wear period, physicians will receive notifications if there are significant events that meet pre-determined arrhythmia detection criteria.
We believe the Zio service is a disruptive option for ambulatory cardiac monitoring. The Zio service addresses patient compliance, continuously monitors patients without requiring patient maintenance for up to 14 consecutive days and produces easy-to-read, comprehensive digital reports that provide the information physicians need to make accurate and timely clinical decisions. Clinical studies have shown that our innovative digital healthcare solution improves physicians’ abilities to detect arrhythmias by increasing diagnostic yield, and potentially allows them to change the course of treatment. Our proprietary deep-learned algorithms give us a competitive advantage due to the depth and breadth of ECG data available from the over 750 million hours of curated and annotated ECG data collected to date. Additionally, we believe we have the first mover advantage in the long-term continuous market, particularly related to our efforts to secure both policy coverage and, where applicable, contracts with the majority of payors in the United States including CMS and other government agencies. Over 95% of patients in the U.S. are able to access reimbursed Zio services through our third-party payor contracts, our IDTF participation status with CMS, and self-pay programs when excluding state Medicaid programs.
We are actively working to make the Zio service the standard of care for patients who require ambulatory cardiac monitoring. Our solution helps reduce healthcare costs and improves arrhythmia detection, characterization and diagnosis by providing simple, seamless integration of heart rhythm data from patient to cloud to physician. We believe we offer a high value, low cost, disruptive solution to a market ready for innovative technology.
Key Benefits
Value to Patients
We designed the Zio monitor specifically to address patient compliance issues common to other ambulatory cardiac monitors. Our wire-free wearable biosensor is easy to apply, comfortable, lightweight and unobtrusive. The Zio monitor requires no patient management or manipulation during the wear period because no battery changes, patch changes, adhesive changes or lead wire / electrode management is required. Patients wear it discreetly during activities of daily life including exercising and showering for up to 14 consecutive days. We interpreted a clinical study by Barrett et al published in The American Journal of Medicine in January 2014, or the Barrett Study, to confirm that the Zio service is a patient-friendly monitoring option, and the study noted that 94% of patients found the Zio monitor comfortable to wear. The Zio monitor allows patients to mark when a symptom occurs by pressing a button on the Zio monitor and logging the surrounding circumstances into a written or digital symptom diary, thus allowing physicians to link symptoms with the ECG data. Additionally, patients have access to our professional 24/7 customer service team and dedicated financial counselors to address any product, service, enrollment or billing questions.
Value to Providers
Providers, such as physicians, receive high-quality, easy-to-read, actionable digital reports that help them diagnose patients and streamline clinical workflow. The Zio service has been shown in multiple peer-reviewed published clinical studies to detect more arrhythmias compared to Holter monitoring during their respective prescribed wear periods confirming the Zio service's added benefit of higher diagnostic yield beyond 48 hours of wear time. We analyze and generate patient reports at our CMS-certified independent diagnostic testing facilities (“IDTFs”) staffed with our certified cardiographic technicians who specialize in advanced arrhythmia interpretation to help ensure high accuracy and quality of reports before delivering them to the prescribing physician. Due to high patient compliance, the reports include up to 14 days of non-interrupted data correlated with patient-triggered and diary symptom events. Physicians can use this continuous correlated data to more conclusively diagnose arrhythmias.
Accurate detection and higher diagnostic yield allow physicians to more quickly prescribe the appropriate treatment options for patients, while minimizing the need for repeat testing. From our review, we determined that in 28% of cases observed in a clinical study by Rosenberg et al published in Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology in March 2013, or the Rosenberg Study, the physician changed the patient’s clinical management after prescribing the Zio service as compared to a Holter monitor.
Additionally, the Zio service allows clinical staff to focus on more value-added activities by not requiring electrode changes or battery recharging during use, device cleaning and maintenance following use, and by reducing physician and 
hospital staff time needed to review and curate ECG data. Our 24/7 customer service team provides troubleshooting for patient-related issues, removing this burden from the physician practice.
Value to Payors
The Zio service offers a high-yield, low-cost solution compared to other monitoring modalities.
The graph above compares the costs of monitoring to the diagnostic yield of various ambulatory cardiac monitors. The analysis, completed by Decision Drivers Analytics and commissioned by us, uses cost data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published diagnostic yields, and our internal database, and demonstrates that the Zio service has a diagnostic yield on par with much more expensive devices but superior to less expensive options. This implies that it is the most cost-effective modality among its peer group, optimizing the cost, time, and reliability of reaching a timely diagnosis.
Patients who use traditional Holter monitors often do not receive a diagnosis after one monitoring period. A retrospective, longitudinal study conducted by Arnold et al published in the Journal of Health Economics and Outcomes Research in February 2015, evaluated the clinical consequences and costs of CMS patients who had no previous evidence of a cardiac arrhythmia and were undergoing their first Holter monitoring test. Our review of data from this study indicates that there was no diagnosis reached for 70% of patients after an initial Holter test. The Zio service has been shown to have a low cost per diagnosis compared to existing monitoring modalities due to its high diagnostic yield.
We believe that the Zio service is the best test for most patients requiring ambulatory cardiac monitoring because it allows physicians to identify a timely course of treatment and avoids healthcare costs associated with additional monitoring. The Zio monitor is patient friendly and allows significantly longer and more continuous monitoring, resulting in improved clinical accuracy and a potentially meaningful change in clinical management. Better diagnostic yield results in decreased costs due to fewer additional tests. We believe that the Zio service could reduce the need for multiple consecutive tests because it offers certainty in a single test.
Early detection of arrhythmias allows physicians to assess a patient’s risk factors and decide on the best treatment course for avoiding potentially more severe downstream conditions. Specifically, the early detection of AF allows physicians to consider strategies to mitigate the risk of stroke. According to multiple studies, preventative treatments, such as oral anticoagulants, have been shown to reduce stroke rates by 80%, thereby potentially avoiding the patient effects of stroke and the high costs associated with post-stroke management.
Our Technology Platform
The Zio service is built on a proven technology platform that is designed to integrate seamlessly across the health system to provide long-term continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring. It consists of (1) a patient-friendly, patch-based biosensor that maximizes patient comfort and compliance, (2) a deep-learned neural network algorithm that provides accurate analytics and clinical results, (3) skilled clinical and operational staff who utilize proprietary software to ensure quality in clinical results and are available 24/7 to support physician and patient needs, and (4) a cloud-based portal, ZioSuite, through which physicians can access and interpret the Zio reports via a web browser or mobile application. 
The platform typically collects up to 1.5 million heartbeats of data for each patient during a single application of up to 14 consecutive days. Our Zio service delivers a curated, concise, and clinically actionable report to the prescribing physician. Through the Zio AT offering, physicians can access the additional capability of timely transmissions during the wear period. During the wear period, physicians will receive notifications and reports if there are significant events that meet pre-determined arrhythmia detection criteria.
Zio XT and AT monitors
The Zio monitor is a single-use, wire-free, wearable patch-based biosensor that records a patient’s heartbeats and ECG data. The Zio monitor was specifically designed with the patient and physician in mind. The Zio monitor includes the following features:
•patented clear, flexible, lightweight, wire-free design;
•unobtrusive and inconspicuous profile;
•proprietary adhesive backing designed to keep the Zio monitor securely in place for the duration of the prescribed wear period;
•water-resistant functionality, allowing patients to shower, sleep, and perform normal daily activities, including moderate exercise;
•hydrogel electrodes and a compliant mechanical design to deliver a clear ECG with minimal artifact from movement;
•large symptom button, or patient trigger, that is easy to find and press;
•indicated single application wear period of up to 14 days (for longer monitoring prescriptions, additional Zio AT monitors will be provided); and
•sufficient battery power for the entire wear period, without the need to recharge or replace batteries.
Symptoms can be logged through a paper symptom log or through two digital platforms:
•myZio.com website
•myZio App (iOS and Android)
The Zio XT service monitors continuously for up to 14 days, delivering a comprehensive report after return and analysis. The Zio AT service delivers the same comprehensive final report, but also provides physicians with actionable notifications during the wear period. These timely alerts are provided via a Bluetooth capability in the Zio AT monitor that sends data to a wireless gateway. The wireless gateway, slightly larger than a smart phone, is provided to the patient at the time of monitor application and will collect and transmit data from the monitor to the cloud via an LTE protocol.
Enrollment and Initiation of the Zio service
Once a physician determines a patient is a candidate for the Zio service, the patient is enrolled through our online portal, ZioSuite. The wire-free Zio monitor is applied to the patient’s chest by the clinical staff, and monitoring is initiated. There is also an option for physicians to enroll patients remotely. With this option, the physician enrolls the patient and the patient receives the Zio monitor in the mail along with a detailed set of self-application instructions. Additionally, the Zio service can be ordered directly through the physicians’ electronic health record system through the use of iRhythm’s Electronic Health Record ("EHR") integration service.
Monitoring
The Zio monitor is worn continuously by the patient for up to 14 days without the need for patient maintenance. The Zio monitor can be worn in the shower, while sleeping, and during moderate exercise. During the wear period, the device continuously stores and records all ECG data. The Zio monitor features a patient trigger button for marking any symptoms during the wear period; the patient is instructed to push the button when a symptom occurs and make a corresponding entry into the written or digital symptom diary. At the end of the prescribed wear period, the patient removes the device and places it and the written diary (if applicable) into a pre-paid postal box, which ships to one of our clinical centers.
Data Analysis and Assessment
At one of our clinical centers, the returned device is validated with patient identifiers that are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), and up to 14 days of heartbeat data is uploaded to be processed through our cloud-based, FDA-cleared proprietary deep-learned algorithms for highly accurate ECG analysis. When complete, a preliminary curated report is created. Our process can take the equivalent of 30,000 pages of ECG strips and distill it into an actionable summary report of about 10 to 15 pages, summarizing the key findings and providing supporting details on clinically relevant events and metrics during the wear period. Our certified cardiographic technicians play a critical role in report curation by providing a quality review of the data before the final Zio report is electronically delivered to the patient’s physician for final interpretation and diagnosis.
Final Zio Report and the ZioSuite Web Portal
The final Zio report, which is curated for both Zio XT and Zio AT patients, provides information in a concise format for review and interpretation by the patient’s physician. Data provided includes total analysis time, AF burden, AF duration, comprehensive symptom/rhythm correlation, detailed findings per day, and arrhythmia type. If pre-determined physician notification criteria for symptoms are met, the prescribing physician is notified by phone of the serious findings prior to the Zio report being made available electronically. The Zio report is delivered through our secure, HIPAA compliant web portal, ZioSuite. ZioSuite is an easy to use, intuitive, and comprehensive portal for clinicians that streamlines clinical workflows to enable cardiac care. By enabling streamlined workflows, ZioSuite reduces administrative burden and helps to create more time for patient management. Physicians can open the Zio report and add their interpretation into the report file. These reports can be uploaded into the patients’ electronic medical record for storage and are available for use by the patient’s other physicians. Excerpts of these reports are included below to highlight the key features.

Reporting Events During the Wear Period with Zio AT
The Zio service with Zio AT includes a wireless gateway that provides connectivity between the Zio AT monitor and our monitoring center which enables symptomatic and asymptomatic data transmission during the prescribed wear period. The Zio AT monitor, in conjunction with the wireless gateway and the unique Zio arrhythmia detection algorithm, has arrhythmia auto-detection capabilities that produce actionable event data for physician review. The definition of an actionable arrhythmia event is customized by the physician to meet his or her needs, with the intent to reduce the number of over-notifications of data that do not require more timely medical action. Additionally, patients have the option of pressing a trigger button which marks the continuous record and initiates a wireless transfer of a 90 second ECG strip to our monitoring center. In addition to the final Zio report, physicians receive daily symptomatic and auto-detected arrhythmia event reports.

Zio AT improves the speed and accuracy of diagnosis relative to traditional mobile cardiac telemetry ("MCT") devices and services. The patient-friendly design of the Zio monitor enables 98% patient compliance over prescribed wear times. We believe a comparative review of published literature with our clinical data indicates that the Zio AT solution is able to detect critical arrhythmias up to five days sooner than the leading competitor. Further analysis indicates that Zio AT achieves a higher diagnostic yield in half the time of leading competitive MCT services (83% diagnostic yield in just 14 days vs. 61% of a competitive service over a 30 day prescription period.) Additionally to date, 99.6% of interpreting physicians have agreed with the findings of the final Zio AT patient report, which we believe demonstrates efficiency and time-savings gains for interpreting physicians.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made $4.0 million in milestone payments to Verily. 
The Development Agreement provides each party with certain licenses to use certain intellectual property of the other party for development activities in the field of AF screening, detection, or monitoring. Ownership of developed intellectual property will be allocated to the parties depending on the subject matter of the underlying developed intellectual property, and, for certain subject matter, shall be jointly owned.
During the term of the Agreement, the parties agreed not to collaborate with certain parties to develop or commercialize products on a disease management platform for certain AF patients, and the parties agreed to certain exclusivity provisions on development and commercialization of products for certain AF patients, subject to exceptions, including contractual rights and rights with respect to pre-existing product offerings.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading ambulatory cardiac monitoring option for patients at risk for arrhythmias. The key elements of our strategy include:
•Further penetrating the existing ambulatory cardiac monitoring market. We intend to expand our market penetration by targeting the large existing ambulatory cardiac monitoring market in the United States and driving broader awareness of its advantages. We will leverage our platform of products, Zio XT and Zio AT, as a way of meeting the ambulatory cardiac monitoring needs of targeted large integrated delivery networks (“IDN”). We will continue to position the Zio service as providing certainty in a single test due to high patient compliance and superior quality of uninterrupted data.  Zio XT will be positioned as the workhorse service while Zio AT is appropriate for the smaller percentage of the population that requires timely notification. Marketing and education throughout the medical community are key to bringing awareness and communicating the strong clinical evidence backing the Zio service. In addition, we expect to continue developing and publishing clinical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the Zio service. Also, within existing accounts, we will continue to introduce our Zio service beyond cardiology and electrophysiology into other departments, including neurology, emergency rooms and primary care offices. To enable this broader adoption within a hospital system, we have successfully interfaced the Zio ordering and report posting processes into a number of large health systems’ EHR systems. This seamless integration of Zio workflow processes into those already used within the IDN has proven to be a key factor in spurring growth within existing and new accounts and is an important part of our ongoing market penetration strategy.
•Expanding our sales organization in the U.S. To capture new account opportunities and support growth in existing accounts, we have built a direct sales organization consisting of sales management, field billing specialists, quota-carrying sales representatives, and a customer experience team. We will continue to invest in the expansion of this scalable infrastructure and believe this investment will drive adoption of the Zio service. 
•Pursuing international expansion opportunities. While our initial commercial focus is the U.S. market, we have initiated efforts that will allow for future expansion into international geographies. We have an initial presence in the United Kingdom with efforts underway to pursue national reimbursement. In September 2020, we were named a winner of the Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award run by the Accelerated Access Collaborate as part of the NHS AI Lab. This funding will bring the Zio service to selected NHS sites over a 3-year program measuring clinical, pathway and economic outcomes. We also received positive guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ("NICE") in December 2020 for the adoption of the Zio XT service which may facilitate for future support of the Zio service through the MedTech Funding Mandate. We are also conducting diligence and prioritizing other geographies based on market size, regulatory pathway and reimbursement opportunity.
•Expanding indications and clinical use cases. We intend to continue expanding indications and clinical use cases for the Zio service in untapped patient populations at risk for arrhythmias through our clinical and market development efforts. We believe these additional indications and clinical use cases represent a significant opportunity for us. This market development initiative includes expanding use for our Zio service into the following patient populations:
◦patients at high risk for asymptomatic (silent) AF, estimated to be at least ten million patients at any given time;
◦ongoing management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients, estimated to be one million at any given time;
◦post-ischemic stroke patients, with an annual incidence of 690,000 patients;
◦post-cardiac catheter ablation patients, estimated to be 200,000 annual procedures; and
◦post-transcatheter aortic valve patients, estimated to be 100,000 annual procedures
•Advancing our product portfolio and core technology offering. We continue to invest in building a unique, innovative product portfolio and digital platform that addresses unmet needs in the ambulatory cardiac monitoring market. We will continue to invest in research and development efforts to further differentiate our biosensor, data analytics and reporting, information system and digital platform.
•Expanding our footprint in digital healthcare. We believe that we have collected the world’s largest repository of ECG data from ambulatory patients, and we will continue to look for ways to utilize our proprietary data to create value-driving opportunities in digital healthcare, such as expansion of indications for the Zio service, new clinical insights, new therapeutic discoveries, payor and provider decision support, as well as internal operating improvements, We will also pursue development of our analytical engine for ambulatory consumer and other medical data, including the curation of third-party biosensor data in existing and new indications.
Reimbursement and Revenue from the Zio service
We receive revenue for the Zio service primarily from third-party payors, which include commercial payors and government agencies, such as CMS and the military. In addition, a small percentage of institutions, which are typically hospitals or private physician practices, purchase the Zio service from us directly.
Third-party payors require us to identify the service for which we are seeking reimbursement by using a Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) code set maintained by the AMA. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received 84% of our revenue through third-party payors. As we continue to contract with more commercial insurers and the patient population ages and becomes eligible for CMS programs, we believe more of our revenue will convert to third-party payor billing.
Our clinical centers, where we conduct the analysis of ECG data captured by the Zio XT monitor and the Zio AT monitor, are CMS-certified IDTFs that qualify us as a provider and allow us to bill CMS directly for the Zio service. We meet CMS requirements, including having an independent medical director for oversight and certified cardiographic technicians for quality assurance of our Zio reports.
Clinical Results and Studies
The Zio service has been the subject of many peer-reviewed publications on its effectiveness to date. This body of clinical evidence is driving clinical adoption and clinical use case expansion. The following sections summarize a few of the key clinical studies which have been driving adoption of the Zio service. In our discussion of the results of these publications, we have indicated changes in percentage terms, regardless of sample size, and the statistical significance is demonstrated by the relevant p-values, all of which are less than 0.05, which is the commonly accepted threshold for statistical significance. This follows the convention used by the authors of the study as well as standard clinical practice.
Benefit of 14-Day Continuous Monitoring
A retrospective study by Turakhia et al, published in The American Journal of Cardiology in August 2013, analyzed data from 26,751 patients using the Zio service for the first time between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011. While there was not a direct comparison of the Zio service to Holter monitoring performance, we interpreted results from the study to show that among the 16,142 patients with detected, clinically relevant arrhythmias, over 50% of the first-diagnosed symptomatic arrhythmias occurred after 48 hours of monitoring, suggesting that these arrhythmias could have been missed by traditional Holter monitoring during the typical maximum prescribed monitoring time.
Diagnostic Yield and Monitoring Preference
In the Barrett study, a prospective head-to-head study comparing the detection of arrhythmias between a 24-hour Holter monitor, which has a typical prescribed wear period of 24-48 hours, and the 14-day Zio service, a total of 146 patients referred for evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias between April 2012 and July 2012 underwent simultaneous ambulatory ECG recording with both devices. The purpose of the Barrett study was to determine the number of arrhythmia events and the percentage of patients in whom an arrhythmia was detected, known as “diagnostic yield,” during the comparative prescribed wear periods. Our interpretation of the results of the Barrett study are that over the total wear period of each device, the Zio service detected 96 arrhythmia events compared with 61 arrhythmia events by the Holter monitor (P < 0.001) providing a 57% improvement in diagnostic yield. An increase in diagnostic yield provides increased data for the prescribing physician to use when making a diagnosis. In addition, we interpreted survey results to show that 94% of patients found the Zio XT monitor comfortable to wear, whereas only 52% patients found the Holter monitor comfortable to wear. Of the 102 physicians surveyed, from our review, we concluded that 90% thought a definitive diagnosis was achieved using data from the Zio service, as opposed to 64% using data from the 24-hour Holter monitor. This clinical trial, however, was a single center study with a relatively small sample size which did not compare the Zio service with any product except the Holter monitor.
A prospective, randomized study by Eysenck et al, published in the Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology in February 2019, compared the accuracy of AF burden detection across four different categories of external cardiac monitors ("ECMs") to implanted pacemakers ("PPM"), the ‘gold standard’ of rhythm monitoring. The study enrolled 21 patients previously implanted with a PPM, each acting as their own control subject, who wore every ECM, including Zio XT, for two weeks in randomized order. Zio XT had an R-squared assessment of fit value of 0.99 compared to the PPM. Zio XT was the only monitor to detect 100% of clinically relevant AF, outperforming the other ECM monitors in the study.
Changing Clinical Management for AF
In the Rosenberg Study, a prospective single center study of 74 patients undergoing management of AF, patients received both the Zio XT monitor and a 24-hour Holter monitor simultaneously to determine the pattern of AF, to document a response to therapy and to potentially diagnose other arrhythmias. From our review, we concluded that the Zio service identified AF events in 24% more patients (18 patients) than Holter monitors (P < 0.0001) and the diagnosed pattern of AF was changed in 28% of patients (21 patients) after Zio service monitoring.
Based on our review of the study, we concluded that 28% of patients (21 patients) had a change in their clinical management. The most common changes included a change in antiarrhythmic medication, initiation or discontinuation of anticoagulation medication, recommendation of pacemaker placement, atrioventricular junction ablation, pulmonary vein isolation procedure and cardioversion. This clinical trial, however, was also a single center study with a relatively small sample size which did not compare the Zio service with any product except the Holter monitor.
AF Burden as a Predictor of Stroke Risk
The KP-RHYTHM Study, a retrospective study of 1,965 Kaiser Permanente patients with paroxysmal AF who were monitored with the Zio service between October 2011 and October 2016, examined the independent association between AF burden, which is the amount of time that a patient spends in AF during the monitoring period as measured by the Zio service, and the risk of ischemic stroke. The findings were derived by linking detailed clinical outcome data from Kaiser Permanente’s electronic medical records with our database of analyzed ECG recordings. We interpreted the study results to show that an AF burden of more than 11% of the total time their heart rhythm was monitored was found to be associated with a three-fold increase in stroke risk, independent of other known risk factors in patients who were not taking medication to prevent blood clots. We concluded that these results suggest that information on AF burden, which is measured by the Zio service, may help patients and providers better evaluate treatment options for reducing risk of stroke. This clinical study was limited to Kaiser Permanente’s patients from the Northern and Southern California regions.
Monitoring of Asymptomatic AF in High Risk Patients
Currently, the Zio service is prescribed by physicians primarily for symptomatic patients. However, the NSA estimates that one-third of the AF population suffers from asymptomatic, or silent, AF. We see a future opportunity in proactively monitoring the approximately ten million patients who are at high risk of asymptomatic AF to identify those with the illness.
STUDY-AF was a single-center, single-arm prospective study by Turakhia et al published in Clinical Cardiology in May 2015 that enrolled 75 high-risk but previously undiagnosed AF patients from May 2012 to August 2013. Patients were 55 years of age or older and considered high risk with two or more of the following risk factors: coronary disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes or sleep apnea, but had no prior documented AF or history of blood clots causing blockage in blood vessels. We interpreted the results to show that long-term continuous monitoring with the Zio service identified 11% of patients with previously undiagnosed AF or atrial tachycardia, a rapid heartbeat where electrical signals initiate abnormally in the upper chamber of the heart. We concluded from our review that in patients with AF, 75% of patients experienced the longest AF episode after the first 48 hours of monitoring and there was also a high prevalence of asymptomatic atrial tachycardia and frequent supraventricular ectopic complexes identified, which may be relevant to development of AF or stroke. This clinical trial, however, was also a single center study with a relatively small sample size.
The mHealth Screening to Prevent Strokes, or mSToPS study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in July 2018, in collaboration with Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, utilized a web-based platform to remotely recruit from 5,214 eligible patients from the Aetna Commercial Fully Insured and Medicare Advantage programs. Women over the age of 65 and men over 55 with certain risk factors were selected to participate based on information derived from claims data that placed them at a potentially increased risk of undiagnosed asymptomatic AF. The one-year results were published in Heart Rhythm O2 in December 2020. We interpreted the results to show that at one-year, AF was newly diagnosed in 6.6 percent of patients who were actively monitored by the Zio service versus 2.4 percent in the observational control group receiving routine care. In addition to this primary endpoint to evaluate the difference in new AF diagnoses, active monitoring in an asymptomatic, moderate-risk population with the Zio service was associated with an increase in cardiology outpatient visits but also significantly lower rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations over the one year following monitoring. We concluded that these results suggest active monitoring with the Zio service can significantly reduce high-cost healthcare resource utilization and shift toward appropriate care settings at one year. The three-year results were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions during the Late Breaking Science session in November 2020. At the end of three years after the initial onset of monitoring:
•AF was newly diagnosed in 11.4% of those actively monitored with the Zio service versus only 7.7% of the control group (a statistically significant 48% improvement).
•The trial found the incidence rate of a cardiac event (stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, or death) was 8.4 per 100 person-years in people diagnosed with AF who underwent active monitoring, compared to the control group incidence rate of 13.8 per 100 person-years (a statistically significant improvement). This data demonstrates the Zio service’s detection of AF in moderate-risk patients supported the prevention of serious cardiac events after diagnosis.
•Active monitoring with the Zio service also led to fewer hospitalizations for bleeding, the primary safety endpoint for the study (incidence rate of 0.32 per 100 person-years versus 0.71 per 100 person-years).
•Active monitoring also led to fewer total hospitalizations (12.9 versus 18.9 per 100 person-years).
We concluded the mSToPS study found that active screening for AF, as part of a prospective, pragmatic, direct-to-participant and nationwide study, was associated with a significant improvement in clinical outcomes and safety at three years relative to routine care
An additional study examining early detection of AF using the Zio service in high risk patients is the Home-based Screening for Early Detection of AF, or SCREEN-AF. Initial results were presented at the combined European Stroke Organization / World Stroke Organization Conference in November 2020. This randomized control trial recruited 822 patients older than 75 years with hypertension and no known AF from 49 family practice clinics across Canada and Germany between 2015 to 2019. The intervention group included ambulatory screening for AF for two weeks with the Zio service utilized at baseline and again at three months, in addition to standard care for six months. We interpreted the results to show AF was newly diagnosed in the screening group in 5.3% of subjects at six months compared to 0.5% in the standard of care control group. A secondary outcome showed oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy was prescribed for 75% of participants who had screen-detected AF. We concluded that proactive screening and monitoring using the Zio service could increase AF detection by 10-fold over standard of care potentially prompting anticoagulation use.
In November 2019, we announced our participation in a randomized, controlled study, GUARD-AF (Reducing stroke by screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation in elderly individuals), sponsored by the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance. The study seeks to determine if earlier detection of AF through screening in previously undiagnosed men and women ultimately impacts the rate of stroke, compared to usual standard medical care. The screening arm will utilize the Zio XT service. The GUARD-AF study population (n=52,000) will include men and women at least 70 years of age visiting their primary care physician for usual follow-up care. The primary outcome measures will be stroke and bleeding events leading to hospitalization. The trial will identify outcome events using insurance claims from a healthcare claims database which, although subject to certain limitations, is expected to provide evidence on health outcomes associated with AF detection intervention that may help inform future guidelines.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities are focused on:
•Improvements and extensions to existing products and services. We are continuously working to improve the Zio service to increase patient comfort, product quality, operational scalability and security.
•Advancing our technology offering. Our product pipeline includes patch-based solutions that combine continuous monitoring for extended periods with accelerated notification of significant events through mobile transmission capabilities.

•Data analytics. We are focused on improving and enhancing our backend deep-learned analytic platform, building on our core competency in data analytics.
•Developing clinical evidence. We are involved in clinical studies to further support the benefits of the Zio service and expand indications for use.
•Continuing to solidify our footprint in digital healthcare. Using our repository of ambulatory ECG patient data, we will continue to look for ways to create value-driving opportunities in digital healthcare, such as expansion of indications for the Zio service, new therapeutic discoveries, development of an analytical engine for ambulatory consumer and other medical data and payor and provider decision support.
Our research and development activities consist of software development, algorithm and product development, regulatory affairs, and clinical research. Our research and development expense was $41.3 million, $37.3 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
We market our ambulatory cardiac monitoring solution in the United States through a direct sales organization comprised of sales management, field billing specialists, quota-carrying sales representatives, and a customer experience team. As of December 31, 2020 we had 145 sales representatives on a full-time equivalent basis, compared to 139 in 2019, and 112 in 2018. Our sales representatives focus on initial introduction into new accounts, penetration across a sales region, driving adoption within existing accounts and conveying our message of clinical and economic value to service line managers, hospital administrators, and other clinical departments. We continue to increase the size of our U.S. sales organization to expand the current customer account base and increase utilization of our Zio service. In addition, we will continue exploring sales and marketing expansion opportunities in international geographies.
We market our Zio service to a variety of physician specialties including general cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists, and other physician specialists who diagnose and manage care for patients with arrhythmias. We have found success focusing on IDNs, in which large networks of facilities and providers work together to offer a continuum of care to a specific geographic area or market. Focusing on sales to IDNs gives us the opportunity to conduct a holistic sale for health systems interested in making value-based purchasing decisions.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions, results of clinical research, corporate combinations and other factors. Large competitors in the ambulatory cardiac market include companies that sell standard Holter monitors including GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, Mortara Instrument, Inc., Spacelabs Healthcare Inc. and Welch Allyn Holdings, Inc., which was acquired by Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. Additional competitors, such as BioTelemetry, Inc. recently acquired by Royal Philips, Preventice Solutions, Inc., being acquired by Boston Scientific, Inc. and Bardy Diagnostics, Inc., being acquired by Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. offer ambulatory cardiac monitoring services and also function as service providers. Recently, there has been increased acquisition activity and consolidation in our industry. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Furthermore, many of our competitors have well-established brands, widespread distribution channels, broader product offerings and an established customer base.
These competitors have also developed patch-based cardiac monitors that have received FDA and foreign regulatory clearances. We are also aware of some small start-up companies entering the patch-based cardiac monitoring market. Large medical device companies may continue to acquire or form alliances with these smaller companies in order to diversify their product offering and participate in the digital health space.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of use, comfort and unobtrusiveness of the device for the patient;
•quality and clinical validation of the deep-learned algorithms used to detect arrhythmias;
•concise and comprehensive reports supporting efficient physician interpretation;
•ease of use of service workflow for physicians and supporting clinicians;
•contracted rates with third-party payors;
•government reimbursement rates associated with our products and services;
•quality of clinical data and publications in peer-reviewed journals;
•size, experience, knowledge and training of sales and marketing teams;
•availability and reliability of sales representatives and customer support services;
•workflow protocols for solution implementation in existing care pathways;
•reputation of existing device manufacturers and service providers; and
•relationships with physicians, hospitals, administrators, and other third-party payors.

As of December 31, 2020, we had nineteen pending patent applications globally, including eight in the United States, four in the European Patent Office, three in Japan, and one in each of Australia, Korea, China and India.
As of December 31, 2020, our trademark portfolio contained a U.S. trademark registration for the mark My ZIO, ZIO and a pending U.S. application for Zio AT.  It also contained registered trademarks for the mark IRHYTHM in Australia and the European Union and pending applications for that mark in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. It further contained pending applications for the mark ZIO in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Norway and Switzerland and a registered trademark for ZIO in the European Union.
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property and proprietary know-how as trade secrets, and generally require our partners to execute non-disclosure agreements prior to any substantive discussions or disclosures of our technology or business plans. Our trade secrets include proprietary algorithms, adhesive formulations, workflow tools and operational processes.
Manufacturing and Supply
We manufacture our ambulatory cardiac monitors, Zio XT and Zio AT, in our leased facilities in Cypress, California. This 17,558 square foot facility provides space for our assembly and production operations, including packaging, storage and shipping. We believe our manufacturing facilities will be sufficient to meet our manufacturing needs for at least the next year, and plan to move into a new, larger facility in that time.
Our manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory requirements of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) for medical devices sold in the United States, set forth at 21 CFR part 820, and the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (“MDD”), which is required for doing business in the European Union (“EU”). We are also subject to applicable requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal, sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and remediation of hazardous substances. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers. Our EU Notified Body, the National Standard Authority of Ireland (“NSAI”), enforces the MDD through both scheduled and unscheduled inspections of our manufacturing facilities.
Our failure or the failure of our suppliers to maintain compliance with either the QSR or MDD requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, which would harm our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our or governmental quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.
Our quality control management programs have earned us a number of quality-related designations. Our Cypress, California manufacturing facilities, have received EN ISO 13485:2012 certification. The NSAI most recently conducted an ISO 13485 recertification audit in 2017, and ISO certification was received. We have been an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer since 2008 and have been a California-licensed medical device manufacturer since 2009. The most recent FDA audit of our manufacturing facility occurred in October 2018, and no formal observations resulted. No additional follow up with the FDA was required and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR.
Circuit board components of the Zio XT and Zio AT monitors are provided by contract electronic manufacturers, Cal-Comp USA, Kimball Electronics, Inc., and Veris Manufacturing, Inc. We have manufacturing service agreements with both providers that allow either party to terminate the agreement with 90 days prior written notice. There are a number of additional critical components and sub-assemblies sourced by other vendors. The vendors for these materials are qualified through stringent evaluation and testing of their performance. We implement a strict no-change policy with our contract manufacturers to ensure that no components are changed without our approval. Our production group in Cypress, California performs inspection, assembly, testing and product release.
Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced unmanageable delays in obtaining any of our components or subassemblies.
Government Regulation
United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA)
The Zio XT and Zio AT monitors are considered medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance.
The FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. The FDA allows for two primary pathways for a medical device to gain approval for commercialization: a successful premarket approval (“PMA”), application or 510(k) clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act. A novel product must go through the more rigorous PMA process if it cannot receive authorization through a 510(k) clearance. FDA has established three different classes of medical devices that indicate the level of risk associated with using a device and the consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy. Most Class I devices are exempt from 510(k) requirements. Most Class II devices, including the Zio XT and Zio AT monitors, and the Zio ECG Utilization Service System, or the ZEUS System, require 510(k) clearance from the FDA in order to be marketed in the United States. A 510(k) submission must demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a device legally in commercial distribution in the United States: (1) before May 28, 1976; or (2) to another device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process and determined by FDA to be substantially equivalent. To be substantially equivalent, the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) submission. If so, this data must be collected in a manner that conforms with specific requirements in federal regulations. Most Class III devices are high-risk devices that pose a significant risk of illness or injury or devices found not to be substantially equivalent to Class I and II predicate devices through the 510(k) process and require PMA. The PMA process for Class III devices is more involved and includes the submission of clinical data to support claims made for the device.
The Zio XT and Zio AT monitors maintain FDA 510(k) clearance as Class II devices, with each new generation of a device receiving individual clearance. In addition, the ZEUS System originally received FDA 510(k) clearance in 2009 as a Class II device. The ZEUS System is the combination of proprietary algorithms and software tools that our certified cardiac technicians utilize to curate the ECG data and create the Zio Report electronically. Significant modifications made to the ZEUS System since its original clearance have been regularly evaluated by the FDA, the most recent update receiving 510(k) clearance in August 2018.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including their suppliers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
•medical device reporting (“MDR”) regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•medical device recalls, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA any recall of a medical device, provided the recall was initiated to either reduce a risk to health posed by the device, or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health; and
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and warning letters.
We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH. The FDA and CDPH have broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Additionally, NSAI regularly inspects our manufacturing, design and operational facilities to ensure ongoing ISO 13485 compliance and periodically reviews technical design files in accordance with the Medical Device Directive in order to maintain our CE mark.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and
•criminal prosecution
European Union
The Zio XT monitor is currently regulated in the European Union as a medical device per the European Union Directive 93/42/EEC, also known as the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”). The MDD sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. In May 2020, the MDR, a more comprehensive regulatory framework, replaced the MDD.
The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certified device is marked with the CE mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for the CE mark vary according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the conformity assessment required before the CE mark can be placed on a product. Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states. The CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance with the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard. Our current CE mark for Zio XT is issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, or NSAI.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by Covered Entities, including healthcare providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. HIPAA requires Covered Entities to execute Business Associate Agreements with individuals and organizations, or Business Associates, who provide services to Covered Entities and who need access to protected health information. We are a Covered Entity and a provider under HIPAA and subject to HIPAA regulations.
In 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities and Business Associates.
Under HITECH’s breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from HHS. Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to HHS, and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. We are subject to audit under HHS’s HITECH-mandated audit program. We may also be audited in connection with a privacy complaint. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To mitigate the risk of penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), that apply to us. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely, and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. These new legislative and regulatory developments may impact our privacy and security strategy and our web-based and mobile assets. 
If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH, or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
Because of the significant federal funding involved in CMS programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.
Anti-Kickback Statute
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the federal False Claims Act.
The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) of the HHS to issue a series of regulations known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare products or services reimbursed by any source, not only CMS programs.
Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.
Federal False Claims Act
Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) and in particular, action brought pursuant to the FCA’s “whistleblower” or “ qui tam ” provisions. The FCA imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the FCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. As a result, in recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not only a federal healthcare program.
When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between approximately $11,000 and $22,000 for each separate instance of false claim. As part of any settlement, the government will usually require the entity to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, which imposes certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations. There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the FCA to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of CMS billing numbers, in addition to the more predictable allegations of misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the FCA in connection with off-label promotion of products. Activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and services and the sale and marketing of our products and services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the FCA or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
Open Payments
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, known as “Open Payments” and enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires all pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers of products covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to HHS: (i) payments and transfers of value to teaching hospitals and licensed physicians, (ii) physician ownership in the manufacturer, and (iii) research payments. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a physician, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value, including those provided as part of contracted services such as speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1.0 million). We are subject to Open Payments and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
International Laws
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences in the form of criminal penalties and significant fines for individuals or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. An individual found in violation of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
There are also international privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws, or judicial rulings interpreting these laws, may impact our ability to obtain required patient information and therefore could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through fiscal intermediaries and carriers. Available to individuals age 65 or over, and certain other individuals, the Medicare program provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals, subject to certain deductibles and copayments.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products, supplies and services. In general, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare product or service furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting Medicare coverage and reimbursement relative to our Zio service could have a material effect on our performance.
CMS also administers the Medicaid program, a cooperative federal/state program that provides medical assistance benefits to qualifying low income and medically needy persons. State participation in Medicaid is optional, and each state is given discretion in developing and administering its own Medicaid program, subject to certain federal requirements pertaining to payment levels, eligibility criteria and minimum categories of services. The coverage, method and level of reimbursement varies from state to state and is subject to each state’s budget restraints. Changes to the coverage, method or level of reimbursement for our Zio service may affect future revenue negatively if reimbursement amounts are decreased or discontinued.
All CMS programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers, including those paid for our Zio service.
Our facilities in Illinois, California and Texas are enrolled as independent diagnostic testing facilities (“IDTFs”) defined by CMS as entities independent of a hospital or physician’s office in which diagnostic tests are performed by licensed or certified non-physician personnel under appropriate physician supervision. CMS has set certain performance standards that every IDTF must meet in order to obtain or maintain its billing privileges.
United States Healthcare Reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products and services. The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
It is uncertain how modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions, will impact us and the medical device industry as a whole. Any changes to, or repeal of, the ACA may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other health care programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
Human Capital
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants into our company. The principal purposes of our cash and equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of cash-based and stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our short- and long-term business goals.
Diversity, Inclusion & equal opportunity
We are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We are an equal-opportunity employer. We make employment decisions on the basis of a person’s qualifications, and our business needs. We believe in the richness and quality of a working environment that is informed by people from all walks of life and strive to create a genuinely inclusive environment. We have implemented Diversity, Equal opportunity, and Inclusion action planning teams focused on analysis from diversity surveys and focus groups. We have ongoing outreach efforts to recruit a diverse candidate pool and are building questions into our engagement survey to promote a diverse and inclusive environment. 
We are committed to ensuring our team members are treated with fairness and respect. We believe that a cooperative work environment, based in trust and mutual respect, is essential to our success. We embrace the diversity of our workforce and celebrate the creative value added by individuals with differing backgrounds and encourage employee resource groups such as our Women in iRhythm group which focuses on leadership for women within our sales organization. We expressly prohibit intimidation, hostility, harassment, discrimination, and other inappropriate behavior. Furthermore, we expect associates to conduct themselves in a professional and dignified manner at all times; in doing so, we seek to avoid making associates feel 
uncomfortable at work. We are building tools for managers to promote inclusive development, promotion and retention strategies. 
As new employees join us, they learn more about our policies and culture through orientation and onboarding, our Employee Handbook, Code of Conduct, and compliance trainings. These all provide guidance on how we expect to operate in order to foster diversity, equity and inclusion across our company.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
We are committed to maintaining a healthy, safe, and secure work environment that protects our employees and the public from harm. Most of our employees are working from home and PPE has been provided to all employees coming into the office. Where feasible, physical distancing has been implemented. We use a multi-faceted approach to ensure the health and safety of our employees, from our Code of Conduct to our policies governing the way we act within and outside of our Company. We comply with applicable health, safety, and environmental laws as well as related company policies and procedures. We have a zero-tolerance policy against aggressive behavior, violence, direct and indirect threats, harassment, intimidation, and possession of weapons on company property. Moreover, we strive to conduct our everyday business activities in an environmentally sustainable way through wellness programs, and webinars through our health insurance providers. 
Total rewards
We offer an attractive mix of compensation and benefit plans to support our employees and their families’ physical, mental, and financial well-being. We believe that we employ a fair and merit-based total compensation system for our employees. Employees are generally eligible for medical, dental, vision and other comprehensive benefits, most of which become effective on their start date. Below are some of the types of health and wellness related benefits offered to employees: 
 • Medical, dental and vision insurance
 • Retirement plan with Company matching contribution feature
 • Flexible Spending Accounts for medical expenses, childcare, parking and transit
 • Health Savings Account (with employer contribution)
 • Life insurance
 • Short & long-term disability
 • Paid time off and leave of absences
 • Employee assistance program
It is important that all employees have an opportunity to have an ownership interest in our company, and there are several programs that provide the ability to own our stock. Generally, more than 75% of our employees participates in at least one of our stock programs. During their tenure with our company, all employees have an opportunity to receive an equity award, either upon hire and/or during an annual review process to recognize those with significant impact on achieving our goals. Another program offered to all employees, whether part or full time, is the ability to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Participants in the ESPP may purchase our stock at a 15% discount to market price. We believe our discounted stock purchase program helps to build an ownership mentality amongst participating employees.
Talent attraction and retention
As we recruit top talent to join our team, we use job boards focused on outreach to underrepresented communities, including ethnic or racial, women, veterans, LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, and indigenous populations. 
Workforce development

The growth and success of our employees is a top priority. We are investing heavily to build in-house tools and resources to support managers and employees on the road to success and ongoing growth.
We offer a variety of training opportunities, whether focused on building vocational or management and leadership skills. Our sales and clinical training programs equip employees to perform specialized work to support our patients and customers. Our clinical training program consists of approximately 80 hours of training upon hire, plus ongoing training opportunities to ensure quality and consistency standards in patient care. We have implemented Linkedin Learning to expand options for skill building and are creating a grow environment by asking all employees to have personal development plan. 
Our commercial program provides 40 hours of product training and ongoing field and classroom education to prepare employees to support our customers with high quality service and support. Our management and leadership skill building in 2020 was focused on coaching and core-manager skills. Despite the challenges of COVID-19 on our work location, we facilitated several online courses around our core competencies and coaching practices, and we rolled out a toolbox on our intranet with tools for employees and managers across the employee lifecycle. We conducted an Employee Net Promoted Score survey in 2019 and have ongoing surveys to engage employee feedback. We encourage employee service days and have donation matching programs for company sponsored charities.
