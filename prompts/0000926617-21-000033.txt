 ITEM 1.          BUSINESS    ﻿
 Company Overview
 ﻿
 Corporate Vision:  Our core mission is to transform the state of women’s health, globally, starting with ovarian cancer. We aim to ensure that women of all ages, stages and ethnicities have the best solutions available to assess their personalized risk of ovarian cancer at the earliest stage when it matters most. Our end goal is to serve a large global pelvic mass population and overall women’s health sector with a platform coupled with proprietary science and data tools, which will drive better health and wellbeing for each patient we serve. 
 ﻿

Our plan is to broaden our commercial focus from ovarian cancer to differential diagnosis of women with a range of gynecological disorders. We plan to continue commercializing our new generation of technology and decentralized technology transfer service platform. We also intend to raise public awareness regarding the diagnostic superiority of OVA1 as compared to cancer antigen 125 (“CA125”) for African American women with adnexal masses. 
 ﻿
 Mission Statement:  We are dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic and bio-analytical solutions that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for women. Our tests are intended to determine risk, detect disease, and help guide decisions regarding patient treatment, which may include decisions to refer patients to specialists, to perform additional testing, to assist in monitoring patients, to understand genetic predisposition and to help guide clinical management. A distinctive feature of our approach is the combination of multi-modal diagnostics and data. Our goal is to combine multiple biomarkers, additional modalities and diagnostics, clinical risk factors and patient data into a single, reportable index score that has a higher diagnostic accuracy than any of its individual constituents, some of which are the current standard of care. We are measuring protein levels that are associated with inflammation and nutrition in a response to an invasive mass in the pelvic area. We concentrate our development on novel diagnostic tests for gynecologic disease, with an initial focus on ovarian cancer. We also intend to address clinical questions related to early disease detection, treatment response, monitoring of disease progression and prognosis through collaborations with leading academic and research institutions. 
 ﻿
 Scientific Bases for Our Products:
 Science of Biomarkers: Our focus on translational biomarkers and informatics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers. A biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule that is present at measurably greater or lesser concentrations, or is present in an altered form, in a disease state versus a normal condition. Conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level (i.e., most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies) and at the human response level (i.e., each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner). 
 ﻿
 Consequently, measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state. We believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques has allowed and will continue to allow us to create diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity about the disease state to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases. Such assays are commonly referred to as IVDMIA (also known as In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays), and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression, pattern recognition and the like. Often, IVDMIA algorithms are non-intuitive, and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling. Aspira and its collaborators are considered experts in these areas and, in the case of OVA1 and OVERA, presented both the clinical validation and error modeling needed in order to gain pre-market authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.  In the case of OVA1, FDA granted a “de novo” request for classification of an ovarian adnexal mass assessment score test system, a type of in vitro diagnostic device; in the case of OVERA (previously OVA1 Next Generation) FDA granted a 510(k) clearance.
 ﻿
 Science of Genomic Targets: Our focus on genomic targets allows us to address the drivers of the disease and develop diagnostic tests that detects genetic drivers at early stages to improve survival rates, as well as detect the drivers of disease recurrence. In clinical genetic testing there are two approaches in utilizing genomic targets of disease. The first approach, offered by our Aspira GenetiX testing platform, is to utilize germline testing to identify well-established and highly prevalent genes associated with gynecological cancers that can help in understanding a women’s life-time risk in developing gynecological cancer.  The second approach, which is our new focus, is to utilize transcriptomics and somatic genomic targets to classify the progression of ovarian cancer, which is currently diagnosed by histopathology.  Our research and development and innovation team is actively utilizing the latter approach to identify the key drivers of gynecological cancer that can then be detected in the blood by measuring cell-tumor DNA (ctDNA) from the developing tumor and stratifying the risk of ovarian cancer early.
 ﻿

Science of Proteogenomics: We are embracing the era of precision medicine, which in the case of disease detection and prevention means accounting for each individual’s variability in genes, environment and lifestyle in order to refine disease detection. Proteogenomics accounts for the combination of proteomic data, or the measurement of proteins in the blood to assess cancerous pathologies and genomic data, or the measurement of the molecular basis of the cancer (i.e. the driver), as measuring the two in combination strengthens the ability to diagnose cancer early in the blood.  We plan to build a proteogenomic approach, which will combine our already established protein biomarkers of ovarian cancer (i.e. OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus) with genomic targets that characterizes the drivers of mutation of ovarian cancer. This proteogenomic approach should enable us to develop and validate a novel prognostic and diagnostic test for ovarian cancer, thereby allowing for specific targeted therapies.  We expect this will be our new foundational model of all new test development moving forward.
 ﻿
 Our Business and Products:  We currently market and sell the following products and related services: (1) OVA1, a blood test designed to, in addition to a physician’s clinical assessment of a woman with a pelvic mass, identify women who are at high-risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor prior to planned surgery; (2) OVERA, a second-generation biomarker panel intended to maintain OVA1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity; (3) OVA1plus, a reflex offering which uses OVA1 primarily and OVERA as a confirmation for OVA1 intermediate range results.  This reflex leverages the strengths of OVA1’s Multivariate Index Assay (“MIA”) sensitivity and OVERA’s (MIA2G) specificity and as a result reduces false elevations by over 40%.  (4) Aspira GenetiX, a genetic test for gynecologic cancer risk, with a core focus on female reproductive cancers, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, uterine and cervical cancers, and (5) Aspira Synergy, our new decentralized platform and cloud service technology, which we plan to house our algorithms for decentralized global access. We plan to make OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus and Aspira GenetiX available through Aspira Synergy. Our OVA1 algorithm received FDA de novo classification in September 2009, and our OVERA algorithm received FDA 501(k) clearance in March 2016. OVA1 and OVERA each use the Roche cobas 4000, 6000 and 8000 platforms for analysis of proteins. Through December 31, 2020, our product and related services revenue has been limited to revenue generated by sales of OVA1, OVA1plus and Aspira GenetiX. In 2021 we plan to begin entering into decentralized arrangements with large healthcare networks and large practices for our Aspira Synergy product.
 ﻿
 We are developing three additional products and related services, including two diagnostic algorithms, OVASight (previously OVANex) and EndoCheck, and a high-risk diagnostic algorithm, OVAInherit, for patients with or without a pelvic mass who are genetically predisposed to ovarian cancer. These products may be launched as LDTs or FDA-cleared tests.
 ﻿

· | OVASight is validated to confirm risk of malignancy for women with an indeterminate mass that includes not only biomarkers, but also other clinical risk factors, and potentially other diagnostics and patient history data to increase predictive value. OVASight is our third-generation risk of malignancy for ovarian cancer test and focuses on women who present with an indeterminate mass with a very low-risk of cancer. In this group, women with a low-risk have the potential to be sequentially monitored to a finalized classification of low-risk or high-risk. This is intended for women who are not planned for surgery. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EndoCheck will be designed as a blood test to aid in diagnosis of endometriosis and is to be used in conjunction with other non-surgical modalities. Current detection methods for endometriosis require a surgical biopsy, while EndoCheck is intended to address this large patient population using a non-surgical solution with both the sensitivity and specificity equal to or greater than surgical biopsy. We submitted an application to the FDA under its Breakthrough Devices Program in the first quarter of 2021, and expect to have a dialogue with the FDA in the second quarter of 2021. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | OVAInherit will be designed as a high-risk diagnostic tool, intended for those patients with or without a pelvic mass who are genetically predisposed to gynecologic cancer. It will use genetics, proteins and other modalities to assess the risk of gynecologic cancers early without visible presence of cancer via traditional ultrasound methodologies. Our related trial, OVA360, has launched and will be focused on developing a diagnostic test for the early detection of ovarian cancer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
  We ultimately plan to commercialize each of OVA1, OVERA, OVA1plus, Aspira GenetiX, OVASight, EndoCheck and OVAInherit on a global level. We currently hold CE marks for OVA1 and OVERA. In addition, each of OVA1 and OVERA and the combination OVA1plus will be offered on our global testing platform, which allows both tests to be deployed worldwide.
 ﻿
 Outside of the United States, we have studies in process to validate OVERA and OVA1 in specific populations. This includes active international distribution agreements for OVERA with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines. The MacroHealth, Inc. agreement was our first agreement regarding our decentralized technology, Aspira Synergy, for OVERA specimen testing.
 ﻿
 We own and operate Aspira Labs, Inc. (“ASPiRA LABS”), based in Austin, Texas, a Clinical Chemistry and Endocrinology Laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists, which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers and disease. ASPiRA LABS provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based risk assessment to aid in clinical decision making and advance

personalized treatment plans. The lab currently processes our OVA1 and OVERA tests, and we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. We also plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS. ASPiRA LABS holds a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab test OVA1 and OVERA to be performed on a national basis. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a supplier number to ASPiRA LABS in 2015.
 ﻿
 We had previously planned to offer COVID-19 antibody and antigen testing in connection with our pre-surgical test offering, as physicians had requested these tests to solve for shortages of testing on the local level. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we decided not to proceed with this offering as such tests are now readily available to our physician partners at the local, regional level.
 ﻿
 The Company has historically also offered in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) trial services to third-party customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA IVD, Inc. (“ASPiRA IVD”), which commenced operations in June 2016. ASPiRA IVD was a specialized, CLIA certified, laboratory provider dedicated to meeting the unique testing needs of IVD manufacturers seeking to commercialize high-complexity assays. The Company has discontinued pursuing contracts for ASPiRA IVD and its contractual commitments were largely concluded in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 ﻿
 Core Products
 ﻿
 About OVA1 and OVERA: Our initial product, OVA1, is a blood test designed to be used in conjunction with a physician’s clinical assessment (which includes imaging) of a woman with a pelvic mass, to identify women who are at high-risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor prior to planned surgery when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. The FDA issued a de novo authorization for OVA1 in September 2009, and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. In March 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for a second-generation biomarker panel known as OVA1 Next Generation, which we call OVERA and which is intended to maintain OVA1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity.
 ﻿
 In November 2016, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) issued Practice Bulletin Number 174, which included OVA1 as a “Multivariate Index Assay”, outlining ACOG’s clinical management guidelines for adnexal mass management. Practice Bulletin Number 174 recommends that obstetricians and gynecologists evaluating women with adnexal masses who do not meet Level A criteria of a low-risk transvaginal ultrasound should proceed with Level B clinical guidelines. Level B guidelines state that the physician may use risk assessment tools such as existing CA125 technology or OVA1 (“Multivariate Index Assay”) as listed in the bulletin. Based on this, OVA1 achieved parity with CA125 as a Level B clinical recommendation for the management of adnexal masses.  
 ﻿
 Practice Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice Bulletins are evidence-based documents, and recommendations are based on the evidence. Practice Bulletins are also the only clinical management tool used for adnexal masses. Although there are Practice Bulletins, guidelines do not exist for adnexal masses. ACOG guidelines do exist, however, for ovarian cancer management.  
 ﻿
 About OVA1plus: In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched OVA1plus. OVA1plus is a reflex test performed for those OVA1 test results that are in the intermediate risk range. For all OVA1 test results in this intermediate risk range, OVERA is performed to stratify a patient’s risk of malignancy. This is designed to improve diagnostic accuracy by increasing specificity which reduces false positive rate by 40%. OVA1plus also helps drive earlier detection, which in turn may lower overall healthcare costs and reduce inefficiencies in the care pathway. We expect OVA1plus to be available through our decentralized platform structure, Aspira Synergy. This will allow other facilities, including hospital networks and large doctor practices, to perform OVA1plus locally, upload the clinical data and receive the OVA1plus score, enabling point of care testing, increased reach and worldwide access to our OVA1plus technology.
 ﻿
 About Aspira GenetiX: In June 2019, we launched Aspira GenetiX, which is a genetic test for gynecologic cancer risk, with a core focus on female reproductive cancers, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, uterine and cervical cancers. Aspira GenetiX’s initial offering is designed to detect hereditary breast and gynecological cancer syndromes and test for genetic carriers of autosomal recessive and X-linked diseases. Women who test positive for variants of such highly-prevalent genes associated with hereditary risk have an elevated life-time risk of developing cancers (more than 1.3% higher than the general population’s risk for ovarian cancer). Aspira GenetiX complements OVA1plus and is sold at the same call point. Using Aspira GenetiX in combination with OVA1plus offers physicians a comprehensive personalized risk assessment for ovarian cancer. As of January 2021, our Aspira GenetiX report includes enriched literature data and approved National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical management guidelines for those women who present with a positive genetic finding.  This allows immediate clinical management access to the clinician so they may counsel their patient in a timely manner.

About Aspira Synergy: In January 2021, we completed the validation of our new decentralized platform and cloud service technology, now branded as Aspira Synergy. Aspira Synergy is an en-suite, cloud-based technology transfer solution that provides an end-to-end platform (sample collection to customized report) for clinical laboratories to internalize testing of our products. Within Aspira Synergy we will launch two sub products, Aspira Synergy Liquid Biopsy for our OVA1plus service offering, consisting of the OVA1 and OVERA tests, and Aspira Synergy Genetics for genetic testing. The Aspira Synergy Liquid Biopsy product, planned to launch in 2021, will allow other facilities to perform OVA1plus locally and upload clinical data and receive the OVA1plus score, enabling increased reach and access. The Aspira Synergy Genetics product is a fully validated Next-Generation Sequencing assay which is offered to laboratories to validate and run locally as their own LDT. Aspira Synergy Genetics, which completed validation in January 2021, is comprised of a custom-built technology which leverages a novel artificial intelligence-based bioinformatics pipeline that has been customized specifically for the proprietary Aspira genetics chemistry, resulting in reduced workflows and redundancies typically associated with internalizing genetics. Aspira Synergy Genetics is fully automated, providing limited wet lab and sample analysis time, allowing clients to implement and run genetic testing at scale and with minimal cost, time and labor at accelerated turn-around times. This year we expect to be granted a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation for our laboratory at our Connecticut office, which would enable us to house a molecular research genetics laboratory to support our Aspira Synergy platform, among others, as well as additional tests that include genomic technology.  We expect Aspira Synergy will expand our breadth and reach of access for all Aspira products, as every commercialized product as well pipeline innovations, will be blended into our Aspira Synergy platform. 
     Product Pipeline
 ﻿
 About OVASight: The OVASight blood test, previously referred to as OVANex, is designed to support detecting the risk of malignancy in women with an indeterminate mass by using the test to first confirm a benign mass and potentially monitor the mass, in conjunction with ultrasounds, and then to confirm a risk of malignancy and lastly to help assess clinical management next steps. The OVASight technology will be validated for application in three separate cohorts of women. The first cohort is patients with a pelvic mass and symptoms. The second cohort is women whose pelvic mass is found incidentally and are asymptomatic, and that are also not scheduled for surgery. The third cohort is women with or without a pelvic mass that are genetically predisposed to develop ovarian cancer. Validation in this overall patient population will be supported by our longitudinal prospective clinical study launched in 2020. The OVASight test will be launched initially as an LDT, but we may choose in the future to submit an FDA marketing application for the test. The OVASight test is expected to have a high sensitivity and specificity as well as a high negative predictive value of greater than 99%, which will allow physicians to serially monitor women with a mass to delay or avoid unnecessary surgery. A serial monitoring solution, which involves testing each patient two to four times a year in conjunction with an ultrasound, presents a new and potentially large market opportunity for us. We expect Phase I of OVASight to be commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2021.     ﻿
 About EndoCheck: The EndoCheck blood test is designed to be an aid in the diagnosis and detection of endometriosis We submitted an application to the FDA under its Breakthrough Devices Program in the first quarter of 2021, and expect to have a dialogue with the FDA in the second quarter of 2021. This test is expected to have a high sensitivity and specificity as compared to laparoscopic surgical assessment. The current Breakthrough Devices Program submission includes data from several retrospective studies, including specimens from our own internal databank of benign cancers with confirmed histopathology of endometriosis or endometrioma, as well as diagnosed intended use populations with moderate to severe pain from both the AbbVie Elagolix trial and ENDOmarker study that was designed by the NICHD Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN). If a prospective study is not required to support marketing authorization, we expect to shorten our timeline and bring the product to market earlier. If a prospective study is required to support marketing authorization, we expect to develop and validate the test in 2022 and commercially launch in the first half of 2023 as a CE-marked, FDA-cleared product (subject to the receipt of requisite regulatory authorizations).
 ﻿
 About OVAInherit: The OVAInherit blood test will be a high-risk diagnostic test for those patients who are genetically predisposed to ovarian cancer. Studies have shown that in the general population 1 in 400 women have a prevalence of high-risk gene BRCA1/2, while among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent 1 in 40 have a combined frequency for three BRCA1/2 variants. This multi-modal solution will include genetics, proteins and other modalities to deliver a personalized risk assessment of ovarian cancer. We plan to pursue FDA 510(k) clearance and a CE Mark for this product. In the second half of 2020 we began a clinical study for our OVAInherit product, which we refer to as OVA360. There is no definite timeline for the OVAInherit launch at this time.

Strategy:  We are focused on execution of the following core strategic business drivers in women’s pelvic mass assessment, starting with ovarian cancer diagnostics, and specialized laboratory services to build long-term value for our investors: 
 ﻿

· | Maximizing the existing OVA1 opportunity in the United States by actively pursuing payer coverage and commercialization of OVA1;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding the distribution platform beyond the U.S. by launching OVERA, a next generation biomarker panel, and OVA1 on the same platform, while building the clinical utility and health economics foundation of both OVA1 and OVERA, which we believe may allow for better domestic market penetration and international expansion;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leveraging our existing database and specimen bank while building the largest specimen and data repository of gynecologic pelvic mass patients worldwide;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding our product offerings to additional women’s health diseases with a focus on pelvic disease conditions such as pelvic mass monitoring and endometriosis by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, genetics, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification of women presenting with a pelvic mass;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Coupling our OVA1 products with an individual’s hereditary genetic risk to refine ovarian cancer risk assessment for the high-risk populations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding distribution avenues to super groups and health systems through our de-centralized testing platform, Aspira Synergy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We believe that these business drivers will contribute significantly to addressing unmet medical needs for women faced with gynecologic disease and other conditions and the continued development of our business.
 ﻿
 Studies and Publications
 ﻿

In 2020, we did a study on low-risk Multivariate Index Assay (“MIA”) scores, physician referral and surgical choices in women with adnexal masses.  This was a retrospective chart study showing that a high proportion of low-risk OVA1 patients were not referred to a gynecologic oncologist prior to surgery, indicating gynecologists may use MIA OVA1 along with clinical and radiographic findings to retain patients for their care. See our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of peer reviewed publications or articles published by outside parties regarding our technology.
 ﻿
 The Diagnostic Field
 ﻿
 The economics of healthcare demand effective and efficient allocation of resources which can be accomplished through disease prevention, early detection of disease leading to early intervention, and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention. In 2020, Allied Market Research, a market research and business consulting partnership, published a study which forecasts the global IVD market to reach $91.1 billion by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% from 2019 to 2027. We have chosen to concentrate our business focus in the areas of oncology and women’s health where we have established strong key opinion leaders, and provider and patient relationships. Demographic trends suggest that, as the population ages, the burden from gynecologic diseases, including cancers, will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests will escalate. In addition, the areas of oncology and women’s health generally lack quality diagnostic tests and, therefore, we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests. 
 ﻿
 Ovarian Cancer
 ﻿
 Background
 ﻿
 Commonly known as the “silent killer,” ovarian cancer leads to nearly 14,000 deaths each year in the United States. As of early 2020, The American Cancer Society (“ACS”) estimated that nearly 21,000 new ovarian cancer cases will be diagnosed, with the majority of patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis, which leads to high mortality rates. According to the National Cancer Institute, when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage (stage 1), patients have up to a 92.6% 5-year survival rate following surgery and/or chemotherapy. However, many ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed after the tumor has spread outside the ovary. For ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late-stages of the disease, the 5-year survival rate falls to as low as 22.5%. 
 ﻿
 While the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of long-term survival from the disease, another factor that predicts clinical outcomes from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such 

 
7

 
as gynecologic oncologists or at specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors. Published guidelines from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (“SGO”) and the ACOG recommend referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists. Unfortunately, we believe only about one-third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists, in part because of inadequate diagnostics that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high-risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low-risk of ovarian cancer, which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Invasive masses have a disease outside the pelvic mass and need to go to chemotherapy treatment immediately followed by surgical removal.  The goal is to catch the mass early before it becomes an invasive cancer.
 ﻿
 Although adnexal masses are relatively common, malignant tumors are less so. Screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of simple ovarian cysts in women 55 years of age and older can be as high as 14%.[1] Adnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women, but there are more non-persistent, physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic group. For instance, in the University of Kentucky ovarian cancer screening project, the rate of postmenopausal women with persistently abnormal ultrasound findings requiring surgery was 1.4%.[2] According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are 36.8 million women between the ages of 50 and 70 in the U.S., suggesting that there are more than 500,000 suspicious adnexal masses in this segment alone. Those that do require evaluation for the likelihood for malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of OVA1 or OVERA.
 ﻿
 The ACOG Ovarian Cancer Guidelines and the SGO guidelines help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy. These guidelines take into account menopausal status, CA125 levels, and physical and imaging findings. However, these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on diagnostics with certain weaknesses. Most notably, the CA125 blood test, which is cleared by the FDA for the monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer only, is negative in up to 50% of early stage ovarian cancer cases. Moreover, CA125 can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer, including benign ovarian masses and endometriosis. These shortcomings limit the CA125 blood test’s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses. Attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index, with reports of 40-70% predictive value. However, ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator. Accordingly, the ACOG and SGO guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre-menopausal women. Efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for CA125 (the “Modified ACOG/SGO Guidelines”) provide only a modest benefit, since CA125 is absent in about 20% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer overall.
 ﻿
 In November 2016, ACOG practice bulletin 174 (November 2016) states the following “The multivariate index assay has demonstrated higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for ovarian malignancy when compared with clinical impression and CA 125 alone.”[3]
 ﻿
 The ovarian cancer information page on American Cancer Society’s website (cancer.org/cancer/ovarian-cancer/about/new-research.html) indicates that:
 ﻿
 For women who have an ovarian tumor, a test called OVA1 can measure the levels of 5 proteins in the blood. The levels of these proteins, when looked at together, are used to determine whether a woman’s tumor should be considered low-risk or high-risk. If the tumor is labeled ‘low-risk’ based on this test, the woman is not likely to have cancer. If the tumor is considered ‘high-risk,’ the woman is more likely to have a cancer, and should see a specialist (a gynecologic oncologist). This test is NOT a screening test and it is NOT a test to decide if you should have surgery or not− it is meant for women who have an ovarian tumor where surgery has been decided but have not yet been referred to a gynecologic oncologist.[4]
 ﻿
 In 2019, two studies were released indicating superior clinical performance of OVA1 over CA125 and OVA1 over CA125, HE4 and Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (“ROMA”) in African American women. [5],[6]

 Commercialization and Distribution
 ﻿
 Starting in 2014, we offered OVA1 via ASPiRA LABS. In March 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics, Incorporated (“Quest Diagnostics”). Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Aspira’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS. Pursuant to this agreement as subsequently amended, Quest Diagnostics has continued to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens from its clients to ASPiRA LABS for testing in exchange for a market value fee. Per the terms of the agreement, we may not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers any tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. 
 ﻿

We have active international distribution agreements for OVERA with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines. The MacroHealth, Inc. agreement was our first agreement regarding decentralized technology transfer for OVERA specimen testing.
 ﻿
 Customers
 ﻿
 In the United States, our clinical customer base can be segmented into three major groups: physicians, physician office laboratories and hospital laboratories. Both within and outside the United States, laboratories may become our customers, either directly with us through payer contracts or client bill arrangements or via decentralized technology transfer relationships established between us and authorized distributors. 
 ﻿
 Research and Development
 ﻿
 Our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and the combinations of biomarkers with genomics that can be developed into diagnostic assays. We have done this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center as well as through genetic testing providers such as Baylor Genetics.  In addition, we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics, in order to generate publications, intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology and other gynecologic diseases. 
 ﻿
 In 2019, two studies identified a disparity in diagnosis for African American women and demonstrated that OVA1 has superior sensitivity for detection in this population over CA125 or ROMA.
 ﻿
 Two of the new genomic targets currently under consideration for validation are (a) circulating DNA mutations from cancer genes; and (b) micro-RNA profiles in serum. 
 ﻿
 Commercial Operations
 ﻿
 We have a commercial infrastructure, including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise. We also operate a national CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS. Our sales representatives work to identify opportunities for educating general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists on the benefits of OVA1. In February 2015, Aspira received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. We currently hold CE marks for OVA1 and OVERA. We are targeting markets outside of the United States now that we have OVERA cleared on the Roche cobas platform, which is available globally. We currently have two decentralized technology transfer contracts with distributors outside the United States. 
 ﻿
 Approximately 13,557 OVA1 tests were performed in 2020 compared to 12,898, in 2019, with the increase being attributed to expanded commercial efforts. In 2020, we continued to increase sales through experienced Market Development Managers and Regional Account Managers. As awareness of our product continues to build, these managers are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive coverage decisions.  They are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the clinical need, our technology assessment package and increasing experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing OVA1, OVERA and OVA1plus.  
 ﻿
 There are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones ahead. First, the average gynecologist will only see about 2 to 4 patients per month who may need our test, and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent ordering pattern.  Second, despite gains in positive medical policy coverage and contract agreements, insurance coverage and patient bills remain a 

 
9

 
concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a generalist who is supportive of our products. We have instituted a “Patient Transparency Program” to assist with this process by proactively assessing insurance and educating patients on testing costs prior to testing being performed.
 ﻿
 Revenue and Reimbursement
 ﻿
 In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for OVA1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Due to OVA1 tests being performed at ASPiRA LABS in Texas, this local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. ASPiRA LABS also bills third-party commercial and other government payers as well as client bill accounts and patients for OVA1. Through December 31, 2020, Aspira’s product and related services revenue has primarily been limited to revenue generated by sales of OVA1, with Aspira GenetiX beginning to generate revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 ﻿
 The Company does not expect to have any significant service revenue going forward, as we stopped performing ASPiRA IVD trial services for third-party customers in the fourth quarter of 2019.  For 2020, the Company’s service revenue was limited to the fulfillment of one legacy IVD contract. 
 ﻿

In December 2013, the CMS made its final determination and authorized Medicare contractors to set prices for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (“MAAA”) test CPT codes when they determine it is payable. In late 2016, OVA1 was included on the list of clinical diagnostic laboratory test procedure codes as one for which the CMS would require reporting of private payer rates as part of the implementation of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”). In November 2017, we announced that the CMS released the Final 2018 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (“CLFS”), effective January 1, 2018. Under the new fee schedule, the price for OVA1(MIA) (code 81503) is $897. This is a four-fold increase over the previous CMS rate, and this new rate was based on the median of private payer payments submitted to CMS by companies, including ASPiRA LABS, as part of the market-based payment reform mandated through PAMA. The rate is scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020. This rate is extended through 2022.
 ﻿
 CMS also published a final price for OVERA of $950, which was benchmarked to the only proteomic test currently on the CLFS that uses biomarkers and an algorithm to produce a prognostic score. The rate is scheduled to be in effect through 2022.    ﻿
 In 2020, we announced 7 new contractual arrangements which brought the total number of covered lives to approximately 173 million as of December 31, 2020.
 ﻿

We are reimbursed for Aspira GenetiX based on either contracted rates or out-of-network rates for covered testing under patient insurance plans.
 ﻿
 Competition    ﻿
 The diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving. There is intense competition among healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products. These companies may: 
 ﻿

· | develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our or our collaborators’ ability to develop and commercialize, or a customers’ ability to use our or our collaborators’ diagnostic products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar functions as the products offered by us or our collaborators, such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators. For example, a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests. If clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease, they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our 

 
10

 
collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits.
 ﻿
 Fujirebio Diagnostics sells Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (“ROMA”). ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm. This test has the same intended use and precautions as OVA1. ROMA is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers, which accounts for 80% of ovarian malignancies. Based upon the results of studies done in 2013 and 2019, we believe that OVA1 has superior performance when compared to the Fujirebio Diagnostics test.
 ﻿

In addition, competitors such as Becton Dickinson, Abbott Laboratories, Exact Sciences (Thrive), Grail, Anixa, Angle and InterVenn have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. 
 ﻿
 We also compete in the development and commercialization of genetic testing for hereditary cancer and carrier screening for autosomal-recessive or X-linked conditions with companies in the United States and internationally. The testing services offered by competitive clinical laboratories, if performed in-house, may be easier to develop and market than our testing, which is performed by a third party.
 ﻿
 Several companies such as Invitae Corporation, Myriad Genetics, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America, Inc., Natera, Ambry Genetics, and Progenity, Inc. offer similar genetic testing for carrier screening and hereditary genetic testing. We believe that the technology offered by our testing is competitive with these companies and that our existing relationships with gynecologist offices enhance our ability to reach customers.
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property Protection
 ﻿
 Our intellectual property includes federally registered trademarks and service marks as well as federally pending trademark and service mark applications for our product and service offerings and a portfolio of owned, co-owned or licensed patents and patent applications. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our clinical diagnostics patent portfolio included 19 issued United States patents, 8 pending United States patent applications, and numerous pending patent applications and issued patents outside the United States. These patents and patent applications fall into 23 patent families and are directed to diagnostic technologies.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing
 ﻿
 We are the manufacturer of OVA1 and OVERA. Components of OVA1 and OVERA include purchased reagents for each of the component assays as well as the OVACALC software. Because we do not directly manufacture the component assays, we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays. As part of our quality systems, reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in OVA1 and OVERA. Only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in OVA1 and OVERA. OVA1plus is a service offering that combines OVA1 and OVERA. Our principal supplier is Roche Diagnostics Corporation.
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters
 ﻿
 Medical Waste
 ﻿
 We are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees. ASPiRA LABS is operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens. We utilize outside vendors for disposal of specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to fines, penalties and damages claims in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
 ﻿
 Occupational Safety
 ﻿
 In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may 

 
11

 
be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
 ﻿
 Specimen Transportation
 ﻿
 Regulations of the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Agency, the Public Health Service and the Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation 
 ﻿
 General. Our activities related to diagnostic products are, or have the potential to be, subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the FD&C Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of our products. The FD&C Act requires that medical devices introduced to the United States market, unless exempted by regulation, be authorized by FDA pursuant to either the premarket notification pathway, known as 510(k) clearance, the de novo classification pathway, or the premarket approval (PMA) pathway. OVA1 was authorized by the FDA in September 2009 under the de novo classification pathway. OVA1 was the first FDA-authorized blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses. We received 510(k) clearance for OVERA, our second-generation biomarker panel in March 2016.    ﻿
  ASPiRA LABS and any laboratory customers using our products for clinical use in the United States are subject to regulation under CLIA, which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of diagnostic tests - namely, waived, moderate complexity and high complexity - and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs.  This year we expect to be granted a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation for our laboratory at our Connecticut office, which would enable us to house a molecular research genetics laboratory to support each of our OVASight, EndoCheck, OVAInherit and Aspira Synergy platforms, as well as additional tests that include genomic technology.    ﻿
 ﻿
 FDA Regulation of Cleared Tests.  Once granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA may place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or to whom it may be sold. All devices cleared by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. As a medical device manufacturer, we are also required to register and list our products with the FDA. We are required to comply with the FDA’s QSRs, which require that we adhere to a quality policy and that our devices are manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We are subject to other record-keeping and reporting requirements.  Additionally, we are subject to inspection by the FDA. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling and promotion. For example, the FDA prohibits cleared or approved devices from being promoted for uncleared or unapproved uses. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA, which prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. Additionally, under the FD&C Act, the FDA may require post-market surveillance of medical devices as a condition of granting marketing authorization.  Non-compliance with FDA requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, seizures, recalls, prosecution and total or partial suspension of production.     ﻿
 With respect to OVA1, the FDA required us to perform post-market surveillance to gather additional data regarding test performance.  This study has been completed.
 ﻿
 In addition, the medical device reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever we receive information that reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
 ﻿
 Foreign Government Regulation of Our Products. We intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests. Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products, to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In addition, products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the FDA 

 
12

 
Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1996. Each country also maintains its own regulatory review process, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, product standards, and labeling requirements. In February 2015, Aspira also received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. In March 2015, OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market OVERA in the European Union.
