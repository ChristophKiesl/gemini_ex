Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on our proprietary arenavirus platform that is designed to target and amplify a T cell and immune response to disease. Our replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human immune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by inducing CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immunotherapy approaches.

​
We are building a proprietary immuno-oncology pipeline by targeting oncoviral cancer antigens, self-antigens and next-generation antigens. Our lead replicating arenavirus oncology product candidates, HB-201 and HB-202, are in development for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive (HPV 16+) cancers in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Our non-replicating prophylactic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate, HB-101, is a potential first-in-class compound in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients awaiting kidney transplantation.
​
Our differentiated platform is based on engineered arenaviruses that are designed to activate the natural immune defense mechanism to trigger potent and target-specific T cell and B cell immunity. Arenaviruses have been used for decades as a preclinical tool to study CD8+ T cell responses. Our cofounder, Rolf Zinkernagel, was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his arenavirus-based work on how CD8+ T cells recognize virus-infected cells. We believe that arenaviruses have several key advantages which give them the characteristics of an optimal immunotherapy, including:

● | ability to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response by directly targeting and activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, which are the most efficient antigen presenting cells of the body;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to induce a robust antibody response to disease-specific target antigens;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not neutralized by vector-specific antibodies, thereby allowing for repeat administration that can boost immune response;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | do not require an adjuvant to stimulate the immune system; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | have been observed to be well tolerated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe we are the first to reengineer arenaviruses for therapeutic purposes. Our systemic and reproduceable approach features two technologies capable of delivering disease-specific antigens for the prevention and treatment of disease. Our non-replicating technology is designed to induce a strong immune response for prophylactic and therapeutic use against infectious disease. Our replicating technology is engineered to produce an even more powerful immune response, which we are currently exploring in oncology indications. In preclinical studies, our replicating technology was able to reprogram the immune system such that more than half of the body’s CD8+ T cells focused on a specific cancer self-antigen target without observed serious adverse events. We have designed our platform to be modular in nature in order to allow substitution of antigens to target a broad range of infectious diseases and cancers. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio for our suite of arenaviruses with exclusive rights in issued patents and patent applications related to our non-replicating technology and exclusive and joint rights in issued patents and patent applications for our replicating technology. We believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property portfolio is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
We believe that our arenavirus platform approach gives us a unique and powerful way to tap into the biology of the immune system and reprogram it by instructing APCs, such as dendritic cells, to express antigens that direct the immune system to the desired targets. Our product candidates are designed to deliver full length proteins to activate T cells and B cells to produce a robust immune response through natural means, avoiding the use of artificial ex vivo constructs such as CART cells and related approaches that bypass the immune system’s normal control mechanisms. Although these latter approaches have shown clinical efficacy, they have the potential to cause life threatening side effects, including cytokine release syndrome. In addition, we believe that our immunotherapy approach is simpler, more straightforward and cost effective to manufacture and administer than CAR-T cells or other patient derived cellular approaches.
​
Our oncology portfolio includes two product candidates, HB-201 and HB-202, which both use our replicating technology, for the treatment of advanced cancers caused by Human Papillomavirus type 16, or HPV16+. HPV is estimated to cause about 5% of the worldwide burden of cancer. This includes approximately 99% of cases in cervical, up to 60% of head and neck, 70% of vaginal and 88% of anal cancers. Prevalence and recent studies have shown that approximately 70% of cancers of the tonsil and tongue base and the majority of cervical and anal cancers may be linked

to HPV. Tumors caused by HPV are referred to as HPV-positive tumors (HPV+), and can be characterized by their expression of proteins from the HPV genome, particularly the viral E6 and E7 proteins. These two proteins are expressed in tumors but are absent in normal cells, which makes them ideal target candidates for immunotherapy; however, to date, there are no therapeutically approved agents directed against these targets.
HB-201 uses our replicating viral vector technology to target E6 and E7 proteins on HPV16+ cancer cells. In preclinical studies, HB-201 as a monotherapy was observed to suppress tumor growth and eliminated up to 40% of HPV+ tumors. HB-201 generated a strong and durable T cell response with successfully treated animals demonstrating resistance to a tumor rechallenge. Based on these preliminary results, we believe that treating patients with HB-201 has the potential to both control metastatic disease and prevent relapse. HPV16+ cancers include cancers of the head, neck, anus, vagina, cervix and penis. Based on a market research study we commissioned from an independent third party, we believe that in developed countries, approximately 70,000 patients annually are newly diagnosed with HPV16+ head and neck cancer. Each year, approximately 30,000 of these patients present with metastatic disease and an additional 10,000 patients progress to the recurrent and metastatic stages of the disease. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for HB-201 in December 2019 to assess its safety and efficacy, both as a monotherapy and in combination with an approved checkpoint inhibitor. In December 2020, interim Phase 1 data on HB-201 for the treatment of advanced HPV16+ cancers showed promising anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability as a monotherapy. Data demonstrated responses and stable disease in head and neck cancer patients who failed prior standard of care therapy, platinum therapy, PD(L)1 inhibitor, or both. By targeting an HPV16 specific tumor antigen, HB-201 has the potential to be a tumor-agnostic therapy for all HPV16+ cancers. These early-stage data establish proof of concept for HOOKIPA’s replicating single-vector immunotherapy in cancer. Dose escalation and dose frequency continue to be evaluated in our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, with the next data read-out anticipated by mid-2021. 
In October 2020, we expanded our second planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of HB-201 and HB-202, as an alternating two-vector therapy in HPV16+ cancers, with or without an approved checkpoint inhibitor. HB-202 is also engineered with our replicating technology. HB-201 and HB-202 are designed to use different arenavirus backbones (Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) for HB-201 and Pichinde virus for HB-202), while expressing the same antigen, an E6/E7 protein derived from HPV16+ to target HPV16+ tumors. We believe that our preclinical studies demonstrate that the combination of HB-201 and HB-202 results in a synergistic increase in E7 immunogenicity as compared to either HB-201 or HB-202 alone. Our goal is to establish the safety of this combination approach and its superiority over monotherapy.
Our lead product candidate in infectious diseases, HB-101, is a potential first-in-class vaccine for the prevention of CMV disease. CMV is a type of herpesvirus that infects the majority of people over the course of their lifetime. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than half of adults have been infected with CMV by age 40. The majority of CMV infections are not serious, and the virus can lay dormant in the body for years. However, CMV infection poses a considerable risk to infants in utero, as well as immune-compromised individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients. 
In a CMV-negative patient receiving an organ or stem cells from a CMV-positive donor, the spread of the virus through the bloodstream, known as viremia, can cause end-organ damage, such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, gastroenteritis and retinitis, and can result in transplant rejection and patient death. In this high-risk patient group, approximately 80% of kidney transplant recipients develop active CMV infections. CMV progression in the transplant setting varies according to the type of transplant, the immunosuppressive drugs used and the presence of any other comorbidity risk factors. Symptomatic CMV infections develop in patients in between 8% and 32% of kidney transplants, 22% and 29% of liver transplants, 9% and 23% of heart transplants and 50% and 75% of lung transplants. Based on a market research study we commissioned from an independent third party and reviewed by management, we believe that approximately 110,000 patients are added to the solid organ transplant waiting list annually in developed countries, with kidney transplantation representing approximately 60% of cases. Furthermore, more than 20,000 allogeneic cell transplants, in which cell and tissue donors are matched with transplant recipients, are carried out annually worldwide. In this group, the incidence of CMV infection is approximately 30% as a result of the donor being CMV positive. Current therapies to prevent the transmission of CMV during organ transplants utilize antiviral prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. However, these therapies are only partially protective in preventing viral disease while also being hampered by toxicity and resistance.

HB-101 uses our proprietary non-replicating technology and two antigens to stimulate both arms of the adaptive immune system: phosphoprotein 65 (pp65), to induce CMV-specific T cells and glycoprotein B (gB fusion protein) to elicit CMV-neutralizing antibodies. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, reviewed in the April 2020 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases, HB-101 was well-tolerated and elicited strong CMV-specific immune responses in all 42 of the treatment arm volunteers. Importantly, we observed robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, as well as CMV-neutralizing antibody responses, without meaningful vector-neutralizing antibody responses. These responses increased in a statistically significant manner upon repeat administration. We believe these results demonstrate the differentiating features of our arenavirus platform. 
We reported preliminary interim safety and immunogenicity data for HB-101 from evaluable patients in June 2020, and additional interim safety and immunogenicity data, and preliminary efficacy data, in evaluable patients in November 2020. The interim Phase 2 data were released for patients who received a two- or three-doses of HB-101 prior to a kidney organ transplantation. These interim results showed a reduction in CMV viremia, reduction in antiviral use, and no CMV disease in these CMV-negative kidney transplant recipients as compared to placebo. Strong CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and a favorable tolerability profile were also observed. We expect to conclude enrollment of this trial in mid 2021 and to report additional safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data from evaluable patients in the second half of 2021. 
To expand our infectious disease portfolio, we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement (Collaboration Agreement) with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) in June 2018, to research arenavirus functional cures for HIV and chronic Hepatitis B infections. We received a onetime upfront payment of $10.0 million upon entering into the Collaboration Agreement. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones potentially amounting to approximately $400 million, as well as tiered royalties ranging from high single digit to mid-teens percentage on net sales. Based on preclinical data generated to date, Gilead committed to preparations to advance the Hepatitis B virus and HIV vectors toward development in December 2019. Both programs are advancing to the clinic and Gilead is reserving manufacturing capacity and expanded resources to support future clinical trials. In December 2020, we entered into a Clinical Supply Agreement with Gilead whereby we will provide Gilead with drug product for use in proof-of-concept clinical trials associated with the licensed products designated under the Collaboration Agreement. Since entering into the Collaboration Agreement, we have received from Gilead the non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million and $12.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones. In addition, we have recognized $19.3 million of cost reimbursements for research and development services performed under the Collaboration Agreement.
We are led by a team of highly experienced executives, clinicians, and scientists with focused and translational expertise in oncology, immunology, vaccinology, clinical development, and commercialization. Our Chief Executive Officer, Joern Aldag, was previously the Chief Executive Officer of uniQure, a company that under his leadership pioneered the approval of the first gene therapy product. Igor Matushansky, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Medical Officer and Global Head of Research and Development was previously Global Head of Translational Development for Oncology at Daiichi Sankyo. The fundamental discoveries underlying our arenavirus platform originated with our co-founders, Nobel laureate Rolf Zinkernagel, M.D., and Daniel Pinschewer, M.D., an internationally recognized arenavirus expert who serves as Scientific Advisor to our Chief Executive Officer.

Our Pipeline
We are leveraging our modular arenavirus platform to develop the following product candidates for multiple cancers and infectious diseases:


We are also pursuing the development “off-the-shelf” cancer therapies by identifying the next generation cancer-testis antigens, which are tumor-associated antigens that are generally not expressed in normal issue.
Background
Immune System Function: Antigen Presentation by Dendritic and Other Antigen Presenting Cells
The immune system is designed to protect the human body from infections and cancers. Infections can be generally defined as the proliferation of foreign microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites in a patient’s body resulting in clinical manifestations of disease. Cancer can be generally defined as the uncontrolled proliferation of native cells resulting in disease. In both cases, the immune system recognizes and destroys microorganisms, infected cells and cancers by targeting specific proteins, or antigens, as well as their immunogenic sub-parts, which are referred to as epitopes.
The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defense and enables a rapid, short-lived and non-specific response. In contrast, the adaptive immune system utilizes highly specialized immune cells called lymphocytes that have been selected to recognize specific foreign antigens. Although it takes longer to mobilize, the adaptive immune system is capable of providing long-term, more effective immunity against specific pathogens by being able to recall prior antigen exposure and mounting a very powerful and specific response.
In order for the adaptive immune system to function effectively, the innate immune system must first present disease specific antigens to a subset of lymphocytes called T cells in order to “instruct” the T cells as to which antigen they must recognize. The T cell population consists of CD8+ T cells, those that kill virus infected and cancer cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins, and CD4+ T cells that help or stimulate additional parts of the immune system such as B cells that produce antibodies. Antigen presentation to T cells is mediated by APCs, such as dendritic cells.
Immunotherapy and Current Limitations
The clinical application of immunotherapy in the context of managing infectious diseases and cancers is distinctly different. The approach taken for infectious diseases is commonly that of “vaccination”, whereby the aim is to 

9



prevent onset of disease by administering a derivative of the disease causing agent to a healthy individual. In contrast, for cancer, the approach is typically one of therapeutic intervention in patients with active disease.
Infectious disease and cancer immunotherapies represent areas of medicine with high potential for prophylactic and therapeutic benefit and have generated significant interest and investment from leading biopharmaceutical companies. Data from ongoing industry and academic research have demonstrated the potential clinical benefit for patients in a range of infectious disease and cancer settings and several immunotherapy products have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other foreign regulatory agencies. However, despite ongoing development efforts and successes, we believe that the current immunotherapies are limited by several factors, including:
Lack of Robust CD8+ T Cell Response. APCs, like Dendritic cells, are the most efficient antigen presenting cells of the body and the natural mechanism by which to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response to fight the disease. However, we do not believe there are any existing immunotherapies that have the ability to independently and directly deliver full length proteins to target and activate dendritic cells to present antigens directly to CD8+ T cells. This limitation prevents them from inducing a robust and durable CD8+ T cell response.
Presence of Virus Neutralizing Antibodies and Pre-Existing Immunity. Nearly all viral vectors used to deliver antigens elicit neutralizing antibodies against both the desired target and the vectors themselves. In some cases, these circulating antibodies can be present before treatment is commenced owing to prior virus exposure. The presence of pre-existing vector neutralizing antibodies can reduce or eliminate the viral vector’s ability to elicit CD8+ T cell and antibody responses to the desired antigen. For example, a significant proportion of the global population carries adenovirus 5 neutralizing antibodies from natural infection which can affect vector immunogenicity. Even in the absence of pre-existing immunity, if virus neutralizing antibodies are induced in response to immunization, such as is the case with recombinant adenovirus or poxvirus based vaccines, repeat doses administered to the patient may also be rendered ineffective or impractical.
Safety and Toxicity Concerns. Some immunotherapies, such as engineered T cells (CAR-T and TCR-T), use artificial constructs that bypass normal control mechanisms of the immune system. As a result these approaches have the risk of causing life-threatening immune reactions, including cytokine release syndrome, and can have various other toxicity concerns.
Clinical Application. Two common limiting factors of many immunotherapies are the inability to deliver full length proteins directly to antigen presenting cells and the inability to be administered systemically. The former limitation restricts these therapies to being patient-specific as they can only deliver smaller proteins such as neoantigens and it furthermore prevents an “off-the-shelf” approach. The latter restricts their application only to tumors that are amenable to intratumoral administration, as is the case for oncolytic viruses.
Handling and Manufacturing. Ex vivo approaches, such as CAR-T, require CD8+ T lymphocytes to be isolated from cancer patients, manipulated, substantially expanded and delivered back into the patient. This represents a costly, time-consuming and substantially more complex approach.
Unlike with cancer treatment, immunotherapies in the context of infectious diseases, commonly stimulate an antibody response that is dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells. We believe that a vaccine approach that can generate the combination of CD8+ T cells with an antibody response offers a solution to optimally mobilize the immune response and potentially overcome many of the limitations that exist with current approaches.
Our Technology Platform
Our proprietary platform is based on engineering arenaviruses to carry and deliver virus specific or tumor specific genes to APCs, such as dendritic cells, which are natural activators of CD8+ T cells. Arenaviruses have been used for decades to stimulate potent CD8+ T cells responses in preclinical research. Our co-founder, Rolf Zinkernagel, 

10



was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his arenavirus-based work on how CD8+ T cells recognize virus-infected cells.
Arenaviruses have several important advantages, which we believe represent the optimal characteristics for an antigen-specific immunotherapy. Specifically, they:

● | have the ability to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response by directly targeting and activating APCs, such as dendritic cells, which are the most efficient antigen-presenting cells of the body;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have the ability to induce a robust antibody response to disease specific target antigens;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not neutralized by vector-specific antibodies, thereby allowing for repeat administration that can further boost immune response;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | do not require an adjuvant to stimulate the immune system; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | have been observed to be well tolerated in preclinical studies and clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The arenavirus family is comprised of over 30 currently known species, many of which we believe have potential prophylactic and therapeutic applications. We believe we are the first to reengineer arenaviruses for the prevention and treatment of disease. We have created two types of viral technologies capable of delivering disease-specific antigens: a replication-defective vector, and a replication competent but attenuated vector.
Our non-replicating and replicating technologies utilize both LCMV and PICV two of over 30 species of arenaviruses, as a backbone of the product candidates we are developing. LCMV is principally carried and secreted by wild mice, with human infection being secondary to such exposure and uncommon. Approximately 2% to 5% of individuals in industrialized countries have circulating antibodies against LCMV, which indicates prior exposure in these individuals. Individuals infected with LCMV typically remain asymptomatic or may present with a non-specific and self-resolving flu-like illness. PICV is principally carried and secreted by Colombian rice rats (oryzomys albigularis) and is a nonpathogenic virus that does not cause disease in humans.
Non-Replicating Technology Overview
Our proprietary non-replicating technology disables arenavirus replication by substituting one of its four structural genes with the gene for a desired antigen. The modified, replication-defective arenavirus is able to directly infect individual APCs, such as dendritic cells and deliver proteins that serve as antigens to activate the immune system, but is not able to replicate and infect additional cells in the body.
Advantages of Non-Replicating Technology
Based on the preclinical and clinical data that we have generated to date, we believe our non-replicating technology supports the benefits of our arenavirus platform approach. Specifically, in preclinical studies and clinical trials this technology has demonstrated that it is well tolerated and has the following additional benefits:
Robust CD8+ T Cell Response as Well as Pathogen Neutralization Response. Our non-replicating technology is designed to induce a robust CD8+ T cell and pathogen neutralizing response to fight disease. We believe our technology results in a prophylactic and immuno-therapeutic and prophylactic approach with potential for greater potency than existing prophylactic treatments.
Immunological Memory and Protection Against Challenge. Our non-replicating technology has shown the ability to trigger a robust and long term CD8+ T cell response of at least 12 months in humans. Furthermore, in various animal models non-replicating vector immunization resulted in protection against infectious challenge.

11



Lack of Vector specific Neutralizing Antibodies. Our non-replicating technology does not generate clinically meaningful vector specific neutralizing antibodies, allowing for repeat administration which can further boost the immune response as demonstrated in animals and humans.
​
Replicating Overview
Our proprietary replicating technology was designed to provide the beneficial properties of our non-replicating technology but to induce an even more robust immune response. Unlike naturally occurring arenaviruses which have two genomic segments, our replicating constructs were engineered to have three segments in order to allow for the introduction of genomic space in which to insert additional target antigens of choice. As a result of the larger genome the virus’ ability to replicate is reduced (attenuated).
Advantages of our Replicating Technology
Based on our preclinical data, we believe our replicating technology shows all of the benefits of the non-replicating technology and the following additional benefits:
Quantitatively: Even More Robust CD8+ T Cell Response. In animal studies, our replicating technology has shown to induce a CD8+ T cell response that directs more than 50% of a body’s T cells, which is approximately ten times greater than the response induced by our non-replicating technology, to focus on a single target of choice. We believe our technology results in an immunotherapeutic approach with potential for greater potency than existing therapeutic treatments.
Qualitatively: Immunological Memory and Protection Against Challenge. Our replicating technology has shown the ability to trigger a long term CD8+ T cell response. Furthermore, in various animal models replicating immunization resulted in complete tumor remission after a single treatment and protection against a cancer re-challenge months after primary treatment.
The additional benefits noted above are attributable to our technology’s ability to replicate. This allows it to infect not only APCs, such as dendritic cells, but also lymphoid stromal cells, which are immune support cells found in lymph nodes and the spleen. Infection of lymphoid stromal cells results in the release of a signaling protein which further drives the proliferation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells. This mechanism has the potential to generate ten-fold more antigen specific CD8+ T cells as compared to viral delivery systems that are unable to trigger this pathway. Furthermore, we believe our replicating technologies may also be synergistic with other approved immuno-oncology agents and currently are conducting a clinical trial of our replicating technology in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. 
To demonstrate the superior properties of our approach, we performed a head to head comparison in mice of our replicating LCMV and PICV E7 constructs versus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), and adenovirus 5 (Adeno5), each expressing E7 antigens for their ability to induce E7 specific CD8+ T cells. As shown below, our replicating constructs were superior to MVA and Adeno5, despite being dosed at concentrations 1,000 times lower than 

12



the latter two vectors. Furthermore, sequential dosing of replicating PICV vector followed by administration of replicating (LCMV) vector resulted in over 50% of CD8+ T cells being targeted against E7.

​
In additional preclinical models, including a mouse melanoma model and a cancer testis self-antigen cancer model, we again demonstrated the ability of sequential administration of replicating PICV and LCMV constructs to direct up to 50% of a body’s T cells to focus on a single target of choice.
Non-Replicating Preclinical Data
We believe our preclinical data support the development of our non-replicating technology for prophylactic and therapeutic uses for infectious disease.
HIV Model
A third-party preclinical study was conducted in a monkey model of HIV infection using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Ten monkeys were treated with an adenoviral vector carrying the SIV Env protein. The expression of the SIV Env protein is meant to prime the animal’s immune system to detect and attack SIV. From earlier work, this initial adenoviral-prophylactic immunization on its own was shown not to prevent SIV infection. Monkeys were then boosted eight weeks later with our non-replicating LCMV vector encoding SIV Env. The ten monkeys were also treated with vectors encoding no relevant genes, identified as the null group below. Starting at week six, both groups were challenged with weekly SIV injections for 12 weeks. The dosing regimen of the study is shown in Figure 1 below. As depicted in the Figure 2 below, the non-replicating (LCMV)-Env vaccination resulted in over 70% of monkeys being SIV free at the end of the study, as compared to less than 20% in the null group.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hepatitis B Virus Model
In addition to the HIV model, we explored the ability of our non-replicating vectors to induce immune responses against hepatitis B core, HBc, and hepatitis B surface, HBs, antigens. In our study, we observed that a non-replicating (LCMV) vector expressing both HBc and HBs was able to generate significant CD8+ T cell responses against both proteins. These data indicate that a single dose of a non-replicating LCMV vector expressing Hepatitis B Virus antigens elicits robust cellular immunity against both encoded proteins delivered in a single vector. We believe that non-replicating vector based immunotherapy may form an important cornerstone of a potential cure for the estimated 350 million people worldwide who are persistently infected with Hepatitis B Virus.
We believe that the combination of our HIV and Hepatitis B Virus preclinical and subsequent non-replicating vector clinical data facilitated our Gilead collaboration.
Replicating vector Preclinical Data
We have conducted several preclinical studies assessing the efficacy of our replicating technology, for both LCMV and PICV constructs, carrying the HPV specific E7/E6 fusion protein through intravenous (IV) and intratumoral (IT) administration. Mice treated with the replicating vectors showed no evidence of toxicity. In a mouse model of HPV-induced cancer (TC1), we observed that a single intravenous administration of replicating (LCMV) significantly suppressed and delayed tumor growth while a single IT administration of replicating (LCMV) eliminated the tumor in approximately half of the mice (top left panel). IV administration of replicating (PICV) eliminated the tumor in 

14



approximately half of the mice, by the same definition, while IT administration of replicating (PICV) significantly suppressed and delayed tumor growth (bottom left panel). These mice had complete remission without recurrence for at least six months, which represents over 25% of a mouse’s lifetime (right panel). In contrast, replicating vectors carrying non-tumor specific antigens, such as GFP, demonstrated no anti-tumor activity. In these studies, we also observed resistance to a tumor re-challenge after six months (right panel). ​
​
We have also performed “tracking” experiments wherein we observed that while our intravenous replicating vectors travel to APCs, such as dendritic cells, the reprogrammed antigen CD8+ T cells travel to tumors. We illustrated this in an EG7-OVA model, which analyzed subcutaneous tumors for the presence of antigen specific CD8+T cells. In mice injected with a replicating vector, histopathology showed clear evidence of strong CD8+ T cell infiltration, as shown by the brown staining in the pictures below.

​
We observed similar results in a more aggressive B16F10 melanoma mouse model. In this experiment B16F10 malignant cells were introduced into the tail vein of mice, resulting in lung metastases within three weeks. Ten days after the introduction of B16F10, a replicating vector expressing Trp2, a melanoma antigen, was introduced intravenously 

15



leading to a significant delay in disease progression. Similarly, in subcutaneously growing B16F10 tumors treated intravenously, histopathology showed clear evidence of strong CD8+ T cell infiltration.

​
When we combined the above two experiments, by initially introducing B16F10 malignant cells subcutaneously, and then intravenously, we achieved both a localized subcutaneous tumor and metastatic lung lesions. Subsequent administration of our intratumoral replicating vector demonstrated both a localized response, through subcutaneous tumor shrinkage, and systemic response, through clearance of lung metastases. The long term survivor mice were then re-challenged with B16F10 several months after remission with no observed subsequent tumor regrowth.

​
Advantages of sequential administration of replicating (PICV) and replicating (LCMV)
We have observed increased anti-tumor activity and survival of animals that received sequential administration of replicating (PICV) and replicating (LCMV) in a preclinical mastocytoma model. In this model, tumor cells expressed a cancer-testis self-antigen known as P1A. In the absence of treatment, tumors grew rapidly and most of the mice died by day 25. When given a first dose with a replicating (LCMV) P1A vector, followed by a second dose with the same vector, there was a delay in tumor growth of approximately ten days and an increase in survival rates, with some mice surviving to almost 100 days (left panel below). In contrast, mice that were treated first with replicating (PICV) P1A followed by a second dose with a different arenavirus, replicating (LCMV) P1A, had an average tumor growth delay of approximately 25 days and in 18% of the mice the tumors were eliminated and they survived beyond the 160 days of the 

16



study. Furthermore, and as seen in our other studies, mice with eliminated tumors demonstrated resistance to a tumor re-challenge (right panel below).

Our Product Candidates
HB-200 Program for the Treatment of HPV16+ Cancers
We are currently developing two immunotherapeutics targeting HPV16+ cancers.
HB-201 is a replicating (LCMV)-based product candidate expressing the E6/E7 fusion protein specific to HPV16+ cells and being developed for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cervical and anal cancer. HB-201 is being evaluated as both monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor.
HB-202 is a replicating (PICV)-based product candidate expressing the E6/E7 fusion protein and also being developed for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers, including HNSCC, cervical and anal cancer. HB-202 will be evaluated in combination with HB-201, both with and without a checkpoint inhibitor. Our preclinical data support the concept that the combination of two different replicating constructs based on different arenaviruses, but carrying the same tumor antigen, results in an exponentially more robust immune response with potential improvements in anti-tumor activity.
We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for HB-201 in patients with treatment-refractory HPV16+ cancers in December 2019; in October, 2020 we dosed our first patient with HB-202. 
HPV-Positive Cancers
HPV is estimated to cause about 5% of cancers worldwide, including approximately 99% of cervical cancers, 25% to 60% of HNSCC, 70% of vaginal cancers and 88% of anal cancers, the majority of which are caused by the HPV serotype 16. While most infections with HPV are cleared from the body with no lasting consequences, in some cases, HPV DNA becomes integrated into chromosomal DNA. When host cells take up this DNA, they express the HPV E6 and E7 proteins. The expression of these proteins can lead to alterations in cell cycle control, which in turn predisposes these cells to become cancerous.
While the rates of HNSCC from causes such as smoking and alcohol are decreasing, the rates of HPV16+ HNSCC are increasing. HNSCC is the sixth most common form of cancer. Each year, HNSCC is diagnosed in more than 600,000 people worldwide, with 65,000 new cases and more than 14,500 deaths occurring in the United States alone. HNSCC includes tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx. The current standard of care for HNSCC is the same regardless of HPV status. Treatment typically involves immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, the precise regimen varying based on the Stage of cancer and responses to prior therapies. These treatments are associated with acute and long-term effects including mucositis, swallowing dysfunction, dry mouth, and dental 

17



problems. The overall survival time for patients with advanced metastatic HNSCC progressing on platinum and checkpoint based therapies is less than six months. While there is no T cell therapy approved for HNSCC, retrospective analyses have shown that patients’ outcomes are improved for those with high levels of CD8+ T cells in tumors as compared to patients with low levels. In many cases, the survival rate of patients with higher levels is more than double that of patients with lower levels of CD8+ T cells.
We believe that evaluating the potential of our product candidates for the treatment of HPV16+ HNSCC as monotherapy is a rational clinical development strategy as there is precedent data supporting the efficacy of immunotherapy in this patient population. Proof of concept in either HPV16+ HNSCC or HPV16+ non-HNSCC could support the potential of our product candidates to be effective for all HPV16+ cancers, regardless of the cancer’s tissue of origin.
Our Solution HB-200 Programs: HB-201 and HB-202
Both HB-201 (LCMV) and HB-202 (PICV) are replicating-based product candidates expressing a non-oncogenic but highly antigenic E6/E7 fusion protein from HPV16. In animal models, HB-201 was observed to be highly immunogenic, resulting in a robust CD8+ T cell response. Based on the levels of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells induced by HB-201 in preclinical models, notably when compared to therapeutic levels induced by other published approaches including adoptive cell therapies, as observed in separately designed and conducted third-party clinical trials, we believe that HB-201 monotherapy has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients across the broader HPV16+ cancer setting. We have observed strong immunogenicity and robust anti-tumor activity in mouse models for HB-201 alone as well as for the sequential administration of HB-201 and HB-202.
Relevance of E6 and E7 as Tumor Antigens
Integration of HPV viral sequences into the genome of a cell can result in the introduction of E6 and E7 oncoproteins. They are present in cells that become cancerous and play a critical role in interfering with cellular processes and interrupting normal tumor suppressor functions.
Profiling of immune cells isolated from patients with HPV16+ tumors has identified E6- and E7-specific T cells, indicating that the E6 and E7 proteins are immunogenic, meaning that they trigger antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Because both E6 and E7 are highly expressed in tumor cells and are absent in normal cells, they are ideal candidates for use as targets of tumor-directed active immunization.
HB-201 Preclinical Results
The ability of HB-201 to suppress tumor growth was tested in a TC1 mouse model of a transplantable HPV16+ E6/E7 expressing tumor. HB-201 was administered either intravenously or intratumorally to animals when tumor volume was approximately 100mm3. In both cases, as depicted in the figures below, single doses of HB-201 led to suppression of tumor growth in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.05) in all treated mice, and intratumoral administrations resulted in an approximately 40% long term survival rate. When these long term survivor mice were re-challenged with the same tumor six months later, no new tumor growth was detected. We believe that these results demonstrate the potential for HB-201 to be active both in treating primary tumors and also controlling metastatic and recurring disease. 
Furthermore, we have observed that the dose of HB-201 strongly correlated with both immunogenicity, as depicted in the left side of the figure below, and anti-tumor activity, as depicted in the right side of the figure below. We believe that this indicates that anti-tumor activity is directly linked to immunogenicity. Specifically, low doses of HB-201 containing as few as 100 replication-competent vector, or RCV, particles per dose suppressed tumor growth by more than 50% as compared to untreated tumors. Dosing with the highest three doses of HB-201, ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 RCV particles per dose, led to greater suppression of tumor growth. These data suggest that the maximal 

18



effective dose was already achieved at the lower of those three doses, or 10,000 RCV particles per dose. All doses of HB-201 were well-tolerated in this model.

​
HB-202 Preclinical Studies
HB-202, like HB-201, is directed against HPV16+ E6/E7 tumors. In a mouse model of HPV16+ E6/E7 tumors, single doses of HB-202 were shown to be similarly effective as single doses of HB-201 when administered both intravenously and intratumorally. Also, as in HB-201, long term survivor mice were uniformly resistant to re-challenge at six months. The results of our preclinical studies of HB-202 are depicted below.

Figure 1&2: Bonilla, W. et al. Heterologous arenavirus vector prime-boost overrules self-tolerance for efficient tumor-specific CD8 T cell attack. journal.ppat. 100209. Cell Reports Medicine
Additionally, we have observed that if HB-202 and HB-201 are administered sequentially, activity levels, which tend to indicate effectiveness, are significantly superior to those observed after repeated administration of either one alone.

HB-200 Clinical Trial
Our oncology product candidates, HB-201 and HB-202, are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers. In December 2019, we initiated and dosed the first patient in an open label, dose escalating Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT04180215) to evaluate HB-201 in HPV16+ cancers, alone and in combination with an approved checkpoint inhibitor. For HB-202 the first patient was dosed in October 2020. The trial is designed to evaluate different dose levels of HB-201 as a single-vector therapy, as an alternating two-vector therapy together with HB-202, and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Dosing frequencies of every three weeks and every two weeks are being explored during dose escalation. The design of the trial for the alternating sequence of HB-201 and HB-202 will be the same as that of the trial for HB-201. The primary endpoint of the Phase 1 is a recommended Phase 2 dose based on safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints include anti-tumor activity as defined by RECIST 1.1 and immunogenicity, safety, and tolerabilty.
In December 2020, we announced positive interim Phase 1 data on HB-201 with our replicating monotherapy for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers. The results are from the initial dose escalation cohorts of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating HB-201 as therapy for patients with advanced HPV16+ metastatic cancers. 
As of December 4, 2020, 22 patients had been enrolled in the first two cohorts, of which 15 were eligible for evaluation. Among the 15 evaluable patients, 11 patients had relapsed/refractory metastatic HNSCC, all of whom had progressed on prior therapy with a PD1 inhibitor and/or a platinum regimen. As per RECIST1.1, in patients with third-line or later HNSCC, HB-201 demonstrated an unconfirmed response rate of 18% (one unconfirmed complete responder and one unconfirmed partial responder) and a 73% disease control rate (six stable disease patients, in addition to the two unconfirmed responses referenced above). 
Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was measured as 72 days and at the December 4, 2020 cut off date, mPFS was ongoing and not yet determined. Although not demonstrated in a head-to-head trial, these HB-201 results, in more heavily treated patients who progressed on a PD1 inhibitor, compare favorably to the benchmark data of a 13% overall response rate and a 60-day mPFS for nivolumab in second line PD1 inhibitor naïve HNSCC patients, based on data published from a third-party registrational study. 
​
Encouraging anti-tumor activity signals were also seen in the more heterogeneous group of all 15 evaluable patients with HPV16+ cancers treated in this trial, comprised of the 11 HNSCC patients summarized above and four other patients with HPV16+ cervical, anal, or vaginal tumors. In these 15 patients, HB-201 demonstrated an unconfirmed response rate of 13%, a disease control rate of 67%, and a median PFS that was also ongoing and measured at 72 days as of the cut-off date. Preliminary data demonstrate that HB-201 has been well tolerated. Treatment-related adverse events were reported by 41% of participants, almost all of which were Grade 1 and 2 and included fatigue, fever, decreased appetite, constipation, nausea, and itching. Only one serious adverse event was deemed related to HB-201, Grade 3 fatigue leading to hospitalization, had been reported as of the cut-off date. The rate of adverse events was consistent regardless of administration route.
​
The Phase 2 portion of the trial will also investigate the efficacy of HB-201 alone, HB-201/HB-202 in an alternating sequence, and combinations with an approved checkpoint inhibitor. Enrollment for this trial is ongoing and we expect to share additional interim clinical data from the HB- 201/HB-202 alternating two-vector therapy segment in mid-2021.

HB-101, a Prophylactic Vaccine for Cytomegalovirus
HB-101 is a non-replicating technology based product candidate that delivers two clinically validated antigens: pp65, to induce CMV-specific CD8+ T cells, and gB, to elicit CMV-neutralizing antibodies. CMV infections present a serious risk for patients with suppressed immune systems, such as solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, HB-101 was well tolerated and elicited strong and durable CMV-specific immune responses in all 42 volunteers in the treatment arm. Importantly, we observed robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses as well as CMV-neutralizing antibody responses. As anticipated, the LCMV vector did not elicit clinically meaningful vector-neutralizing antibodies, as only one volunteer developed a transient neutralizing antibody response against the vector after three administrations. Furthermore, upon repeat administration, the pp65 CD8+ T cell levels achieved by the non-replicating vector increased in a statistically significant manner. The Phase 1 clinical findings were published in the April 2020 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases. 
​
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blinded Phase 2 clinical trial for HB-101 in CMV-negative patients awaiting kidney transplantation from living CMV-positive donors. Based on HB-101’s tolerability profile observed in the target patient population, and to gain further insights that will inform Phase 3 trial design, we added a new cohort of CMV-positive recipients awaiting kidney transplantation from CMV-positive or -negative donors to the trial in early 2020. We amended the investigational new drug (IND) application accordingly in January 2020. The goal of our Phase 2 trial is to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of HB-101 in individuals receiving a kidney transplant from a live donor to measure the decrease of post-transplant viremia. We reported interim safety and immunogenicity data from evaluable patients in June 2020. The safety and immunogenicity monitoring period included the period between the first dose and the date of transplantation. In November 2020, we announced position interim safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from this trials in which we observed a three-dose schedule was able to reduce incidence of CMV viremia, reduce antiviral use and prevent CMV disease. 
​
We expect to conclude enrollment of this trial in mid-2021. From that point, patients will continue to progress through transplantation and a twelve month follow-up period. Given challenges of enrollment during COVID-19, and the 

21



clinical drug supply dating, the total number of patients enrolled in the trial may be smaller than originally planned. We expect to report additional interim safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data in the second half of 2021 and are exploring a path to a Phase 3 CMV vaccine program. We intend to pursue regulatory approval for HB-101 for the prevention of CMV in all solid organ transplants regardless of CMV status of the recipient. In the future, and in the event of successful proof of concept of HB-101 in the Phase 2 clinical trial, we may pursue additional indications such as stem cell transplantation and congenital CMV infection. 
​
Cytomegalovirus
Cytomegalovirus is a virus that is commonly transmitted in childhood and early adulthood. Approximately 60% of the U.S. population has been exposed, and as such, is latently infected. Worldwide data indicate that while half the people in industrialized countries have been exposed, up to 99% of people in developing countries, including China and India, have been exposed. Infections result in lifelong latent persistence of the virus with few symptoms, if any. However, in immunosuppressed patients, such as transplant recipients, primary CMV infection or reactivation generally causes significant morbidity, mortality and graft rejection. There are two scenarios in which CMV infections are relevant in the transplant setting. In one case, the recipient could be CMV negative, or previously uninfected, and the donor CMV positive. In this case, introduction of CMV into the immunocompromised recipient can lead to rapid virus spread and development of serious complications. In the other case, the recipient is already CMV positive, but the immunosuppressive treatments required as part of the transplant procedure lead to reactivation of latent virus. Based on a recent market research study we commissioned from an independent third party, we believe that approximately 110,000 patients are added to the solid organ transplant waiting list annually in developed countries, with kidney transplantation representing approximately 60% of cases. Furthermore, more than 20,000 allogeneic cell transplants, in which cell and tissue donors are matched with transplant recipients, are carried out annually worldwide. In this group, the incidence of CMV infection is approximately 30% as a result of the donor being CMV positive. Current therapies to prevent the transmission of CMV during organ transplants utilize antiviral prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. However, these therapies are only partially protective in preventing viral disease while also being hampered by toxicity and resistance.
There are currently two standards of care to deal with CMV during solid organ transplant: prophylactic and preemptive. In prophylactic therapy, patients are given antiviral drugs for several months after transplant. Antivirals can reduce the rate of CMV viremia from approximately 70% to 36% in kidney transplant patients over a 12 month period. Of the 36% that present with viremia, most of these cases emerge once antiviral treatment has been stopped. In preemptive therapy, patients are intensively monitored post-transplant for CMV reactivation using laboratory diagnostics, and short-term antiviral treatment is given only to those with significant viral loads, or CMV viremia, before symptoms and overt CMV disease occur. In preemptive therapy, most infections occur within year following a transplant. However, the antiviral drugs used to treat CMV have the potential to induce significant toxicities, including bone marrow toxicity for ganciclovir, valganciclovir and cidofovir, and renal toxicity for foscarnet and cidofovir. In addition, CMV drug resistance mutations arise during this antiviral therapy. Despite the use of prophylactic and preemptive therapy using small molecule antivirals, many transplant patients develop serious symptomatic complications from CMV, highlighting the need for new treatments.
Cytomegalovirus in Kidney Transplant Patients
In 2018, approximately 92,000 of the approximately 141,000 solid organ transplants performed worldwide were kidney transplants, an increase of 8.2% compared to 2015. Approximately 80% of high risk kidney transplant recipients develop active CMV infections. High risk recipients are defined as CMV-negative patients receiving kidney transplants from CMV-positive donors. In most solid organ transplant patients, complications from CMV develop between 30 and 90 days after transplantation and rarely after 180 days.
Our Solution, HB-101
HB-101 is a non-replicating-based product candidate designed to stimulate the immune system against CMV and to protect against future CMV infection or reactivation from latency. HB-101 is comprised of two non-replicating (LCMV)-based vectors:

22



●one vector expresses the gene encoding the CMV 65 kD pp65 protein; and
●another vector expresses the gene encoding the CMV gB protein.

We, and third parties, have shown that pp65 is immunogenic. Adoptive T cell transfer approaches performed by third parties, in which CD8+ T cells directed against pp65 are isolated from exposed individuals and transferred to patients with active CMV viremia, have also demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of pp65. However, no vaccine approach to date has been successful in achieving CD8+ T cell levels sufficiently high enough to be protective. gB has been shown in previous third-party clinical trials to be immunogenic and protective by inducing antibody responses but not CD8+ T cells. However, response rates were limited, immunity was transient and protection was incomplete. In our preclinical data, using pp65 and gB as targets, we have observed robust immunogenicity, activity and durability thereby potentially overcoming the limitations of current approaches.
​
HB-101 Preclinical Results
In preclinical studies, we have observed that HB-101 has the ability to improve the survival rates in animal models in a statistically significant manner. In our study, non-pregnant female guinea pigs were administered three doses of HB-101 at 30-day intervals. Thirty days after the last vaccination, females were allowed to mate. Following conception, the pregnant females were infected with CMV during the gestation period, putting the guinea pig pups at risk of severe viral infection, low birth weight and potential mortality. As depicted below, guinea pig pups born to CMV-infected females that had received a guinea pig equivalent of HB-101 (gpHB-101) had a statistically significant (p<0.0001) lower mortality rate at birth compared to those born to females who had only received a non-replicating vectors carrying an irrelevant antigen, labeled as GFP in the figure below. CMV-positive pups born to mothers that received gpHB-101 vaccination also gained weight more rapidly and had improved survival rates as compared to those born to mothers vaccinated with placebo.

​
HB-101 Phase 1 Clinical Results
We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized double-blinded dose escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of HB-101 to assess its safety and immunogenicity. In this trial, 54 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 were administered three consecutive doses of either HB-101 or placebo by intramuscular injection at month zero, one and three, then monitored for one year after the initial dose. The volunteers were randomized into three cohorts of 18 volunteers, with 14 volunteers receiving the study drug and four receiving placebo in each cohort.
We observed that HB-101 was well-tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities and no serious adverse events. Symptoms by volunteers were of mild to moderate intensity and 93.5% of reported symptoms were of short duration (1-8 days). The maximum duration of any symptom was 10 days. Pain at the injection site was the predominant solicited local adverse event. Malaise, fatigue and generalized myalgia were the most common solicited general symptoms. The percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited causally related adverse events of mild to moderate intensity was similar for 

23



placebo and the vaccine groups. Upper respiratory tract infections were the predominant adverse event, occurring at rates in the low dose group that were twice as high as those seen in all three other groups (placebo, middle and high dose). The percentage of volunteers reporting related adverse events of mild to moderate intensity was similar for placebo and vaccine groups. None of the adverse events appeared to be treatment related.
In addition, HB-101 elicited a strong, dose-dependent, and durable response as measured by the frequency of pp65-specific interferon-gamma, or IFNγ, producing CD8+ T cells. Each administration of HB-101, as depicted by the black arrows in the figure below, resulted in an increase in IFNγ producing CD8+ T cells, demonstrating the potential and rationale for repeat administrations of HB-101. Importantly, the frequencies of IFNγ producing CD8+ T cells induced by the highest dose of HB-101 after the third administration in healthy volunteers were in the range of, or higher than, the therapeutic levels reported in human adoptive T cell therapy clinical trials which were separately designed and conducted by third-parties for patients with active CMV viremia. These frequencies were observed to be therapeutic in patients experiencing active CMV infection following stem cell as well as organ transplantation.

​
Similarly, HB-101 administration also resulted in a strong neutralizing antibody response to the CMV antigen gB that increased with each additional dose, as depicted by the black arrows in the figures below, which was sustained over the twelve-month follow up period. All volunteers receiving the highest or middle doses of HB-101, and 92% of the volunteers receiving the lowest dose, developed CMV-neutralizing antibodies. The levels of antibodies generated in the highest dose after three doses were comparable to therapeutic levels reported with other CMV vaccine product candidates in development that have demonstrated clinical efficacy in separately designed and conducted, published third-party clinical trials. As anticipated, the LCMV vector did not elicit clinically meaningful vector-neutralizing antibodies, as only one volunteer developed a transient neutralizing antibody response against the vector after three administrations. We believe that a fourth administration of the vaccine in all 42 of these volunteers could have resulted in an additional antibody response, if desired.

​
HB-101 Phase 2 (H 100 001) Clinical Development Plan and Results
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated a randomized, double blind Phase 2 trial of HB-101 to assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of HB-101 in CMV-negative patients receiving a kidney transplant from living CMV-positive donors. Based on HB-101’s observed tolerability profile in the target patient through August 24, 2020 cut off date, and to gain further insights that will inform a potential Phase 3 trial design, we added a new cohort of CMV-positive recipients awaiting kidney transplantation from CMV-positive or -negative donors to the trial in early 2020.   

We are enrolling patients in three treatment arms:  

● | Arm 1 (CMV-negative, pre-emptive antivirals): CMV-negative patients are being randomized 2:1 to either receive two to three administrations of HB-101 or placebo prior to transplant and then treated with standard preemptive antiviral therapy posttransplant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Arm 2 (CMV-negative, prophylactic antivirals): CMV-negative patients are being randomized 2:1 to either receive two to three administrations of HB-101 or placebo before transplant, and will then receive three to six months of antiviral prophylaxis therapy posttransplant.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Arm 3 (CMV-positive, prophylactic antivirals): CMV-positive patients will receive two to three administrations of HB-101 before transplant, and will then receive up to six months of antiviral prophylaxis therapy posttransplant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Patients are monitored for twelve months posttransplant to assess safety and T cell and antibody responses to pp65, gB and the LCMV vector, as well as CMV viremia and the need for use of antivirals. 
​
The trial design is depicted in the figure below.  

25



​
We reported interim safety and immunogenicity data (containing both CMV specific antibody and CMV specific CD8+ T cell responses) from evaluable patients in June 2020, in which HB-101 was observed to be well tolerated with fewer adverse events in patients with end-stage kidney disease than in the previous healthy volunteer trial. Patients who received three doses of HB-101 showed comparable immunogenicity to healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 clinical trial of HB-101. 
​
Safety and tolerability data was reported in June 2020, which evaluated 51 CMV-negative patients prior to kidney transplantation. Of the 51 patients, eight patients (16%) across the combined, blinded HB-101 and placebo groups showed adverse events related to the administration. Most of these adverse events were of mild intensity, indicating that HB-101 was generally well tolerated in this patient population. 
​
CMV-neutralizing antibody titers on the day of transplantation were evaluated in all of the 30 CMV-negative patients who had been transplanted by the cutoff date and had valid results. Nineteen of the 30 patients received HB-101 and eleven received placebo. All five patients who received three doses of HB-101 mounted CMV-neutralizing antibodies. Three of the fourteen patients (21%) who received only two doses of HB-101 also mounted CMV-neutralizing antibodies. The antibody response of the kidney transplant recipients who completed the three-dose regimen was comparable to the antibody response observed in the Phase 1 trial. 
​
Cellular immune (CD8+ T cell) responses to CMV on the day of transplantation were evaluated in 25 CMV-negative patients who had been transplanted in time for this interim analysis. Technically valid results from T cell assays on the day of transplantation were available for seven recipients (as a consequence of sample logistics and assay performance). Two of the seven patients received placebo and five received HB-101. All three patients (100%) who received three doses of HB-101 and one of the two patients who received only two doses (50%) mounted a CMV-specific cellular immune response. 
​
In November 2020, we reported additional interim safety and immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy data. The interim efficacy analysis included data from 41 participants as of the cut-off date; 8 were vaccinated with three doses of HB-101 pre-transplant, 19 were vaccinated with two doses and 14 received placebo. 
​
The interim immunogenicity analysis included CMV-neutralizing antibody data assessed from 33 individuals, a subset of the 41 included in the efficacy analysis. 21 participants were vaccinated with HB-101 and 12 received placebo. In line with the previous interim data, all of the participants who received three doses of HB-101 mounted CMV-neutralizing antibodies. 
​
Safety and tolerability were evaluated in 69 participants who were enrolled in the trial by the cut-off date. HB- 101 was generally well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects, which were mostly mild to moderate. 

26



Specifically, 17 percent of participants across the combined HB-101 and placebo groups showed side effects related to vaccine administration. Three cases of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-sensitization have been reported, two as serious adverse events. HLA-sensitization can cause the recipient to identify the donor kidney as foreign and may require a new donor to be identified. HLA-sensitization is a known complication of dialysis patients waiting for kidney transplantation, affecting an estimated 4% of this patient population. 
​
The preliminary efficacy analysis included data from 41 participants as of the cut-off date; 8 were vaccinated with three doses of HB-101 pre-transplant, 19 were vaccinated with two doses and 14 received placebo. 
​
Compared to placebo, participants vaccinated with three HB-101 doses had: 
•   a 48% reduction in CMV viremia (presence of CMV DNA in the blood);  
•   a 42% reduction in the use of antiviral therapy; and 
•   no CMV disease (compared to 2 out of 14 cases in the placebo group) 
​
Response to a two-dose schedule did not show an improvement compared to placebo, which is consistent with the low levels of CMV-neutralizing antibody in the two-dose cohort as well as with the T cell data reported in June 2020 for the two-dose group. 
​
We expect to conclude enrollment of this trial in mid-2021 and to report additional safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data from evaluable patients in the second half of 2021. 
​
Targeting Self Antigens
We believe that our viral vectors may be appropriate for any antigen where a T cell response may be therapeutically meaningful. We have shown in multiple preclinical models that replicating product candidates are active in generating robust immune responses to tumor self-antigens and that this response results in decreased tumor growth and an increase in survival rates.
Additional Product Opportunities: Tumor Self-Antigens
Our HB-201 and HB-202 programs target viral antigens associated with virally-induced tumors. In these programs, the viral, or non-self nature of the antigens, makes them a natural target for an immunotherapy approach. In addition, we are pursuing the development of product candidates based on our arenavirus platform to target self-antigens, non-viral antigenic proteins that are highly overexpressed in solid tumors or only minimally expressed in normal cells. Because these self-antigens are found in certain normal cells as well as tumor cells, the immune system does not typically recognize them as foreign proteins and does not respond to them. This protection of self-antigens from immune system attack is known as immune tolerance. The results obtained by earlier-generation marketed products such as sipuleucel-T, developed as Provenge by Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and currently marketed by Sanpower Group Co., Ltd., have proven that it is possible to overcome immune tolerance and activate the immune system to produce an anti-tumor response.
HB-300 in Prostate Cancer
We are developing our most advanced self-antigen project in this area, HB-300, as a replicating technology based product candidate in metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Prostate cancer provides a unique treatment opportunity for immunotherapy because prostate cancer cells express a number of tumor-specific antigens that serve as potential targets. HB-300 targets three of these antigens: prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).
Direct evidence for the ability to induce a therapeutically relevant immune response to one of these antigens, PAP, comes from Provenge. To create Provenge, a personalized treatment, clinicians remove dendritic cells from the body, load them with PAP and then reintroduce them to the patient. The use of Provenge has been shown to increase survival in patients with metastatic, hormone resistant prostate cancer. Other companies are developing dendritic cell therapies similar to Provenge by using other tumor antigens. All of these dendritic cell therapies require a complex, 

27



patient specific therapeutic manufacturing process involving isolating cells from patients, loading them ex vivo with tumor antigens and then re-administering the cells to patients.
Our replicating technology has been engineered to hold two additional genes compared to the natural form of the arenavirus. This allows us to express multiple antigens in one construct. In HB-300, we are including the coding sequences for PAP, PSA and PSMA antigens in our vectors. Since it is a replicating based product candidate, we can deliver HB-300 by simple infusion and it can target APCs, such as dendritic cells in the body, without the need for cellular isolation or ex vivo processing. We have shown in preclinical experiments that replicating vectors can lead to robust CD8+ T cell responses to the encoded antigens. We intend to maximize these CD8+ T cell responses using a combination of replicating vectors based on both LCMV and PICV in a sequential dosing regimen. 

​
In the future, we intend to develop product candidates against other self-antigens with the aim of eventually establishing a franchise of dendritic-cell-targeting agents that take advantage of the ability of arenaviruses to stimulate CD8+ T cell responses.
Next Generation Product Candidates
A critical advantage of our technology is that it is designed to deliver full length proteins directly to APCs, such as dendritic cells, for endogenous expression and direct presentation to CD8+ T cells. Having APCs, such as dendritic cells, express full length proteins and present all fragments (epitopes) overcomes the major difficulty of attempting to predict which part of the protein, or epitope, will be presented by the patient’s individual major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, class I alleles. This presentation is important in immunotherapy because T cells will only recognize and respond to the antigen when it is bound to the individual’s MHC class I molecules, of which several hundred different versions exist in the population. While this approach overcomes the major issue faced by neoepitope based personalized antigen approaches, it also has limitations in that the repertoire of known tumor associated proteins that could be used for targets is limited. The best example of full length proteins that are, to a degree, cancer specific and immunogenic include the cancer testis antigens, examples of which include NY-ESO-1, MAGE and CAGE. These cancer-testis antigens have been known for decades, and many of them are currently being pursued by other companies. For many tumor types the cancer testis type of antigens remains unknown. Furthermore, most of the known tumor associated antigens are not commonly expressed or are not sufficiently specific to tumor tissue, making them suboptimal targets for clinical development.

In November 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with DarwinHealth, a New York City-based bioinformatics company pioneering novel bioinformatic approaches, with the intent to identify the next generation of “cancer testis antigens.” Our goal is to find novel immunogenic full length transcripts that are specific for, and highly represented in specific tumor types, allowing for an “off-the-shelf” approach for many cancer types. During the initial collaboration period, we intend to develop and validate the bioinformatics approach and resulting proprietary algorithms. We will start out by identifying “off-the-shelf” next generation cancer-testis type antigens in mouse tumors, and will assess the anti-tumor efficacy of our technology when targeting these same antigens in tumor-bearing animals. Mice will thereby serve as a testing ground to validate and optimize our new proprietary bioinformatics algorithms. In parallel we will apply the same validated algorithms to human samples, and will prepare the next generation of cancer-testis antigens.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, to preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to protect our product candidates and technologies by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing of third-party intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We, or our collaborators and licensors, file patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions to protect our product candidates as well as uses of our product candidates for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases.

We currently do not own any patents or patent applications that more specifically relate to our HB-300 product candidate outside of the replicating and oncology patent portfolios.
The actual term of any patent that may issue from the above described patent applications claiming one of our product candidates could be longer than described above due to patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if available, or shorter if we are required to file terminal disclaimers. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country.
Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents, or what the scope of the claims in any future issued patents may be. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing identical or substantially similar products or could reduce the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. With respect to patents and patent applications licensed to us, our licensors may have the right to terminate our licenses if we fail to comply with our obligations under the applicable license agreement. In addition, the claims granted in any of our issued patents may not provide us with advantages against 

31



competitors with similar products or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or identical to technology developed by us but that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, by the time that any of our product candidates or those developed by our collaborators can be commercialized, our key patent may have expired or may only continue to remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the usefulness of the patent.
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Gilead Collaboration Agreement
Overview
On June 4, 2018, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Gilead to collaborate on preclinical research programs to evaluate potential vaccine products using or incorporating our replicating and non- replicating technology platforms for the treatment, cure, diagnosis, or prevention of Hepatitis B Virus or HIV, which we refer to, collectively, as the Field.
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Gilead an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates), worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our know-how and our owned and in-licensed patent rights (including those patent rights in-licensed from the University of Geneva, the University of Basel, and the University of Zurich) that are necessary or reasonably useful for researching, developing, manufacturing or commercializing products that contain a vaccine that uses our replicating or non- replicating technology platforms for expressing one or more HIV or Hepatitis B Virus antigens, which foregoing know-how and patent rights we refer to as the Licensed Technology (and each such product a Licensed Product), for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing Licensed Products for uses in the Field.
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we will own all new intellectual property conceived or created out of the activities conducted under the Collaboration Agreement that specifically relate to the replicating and non- replicating technology platforms. Gilead will own all other intellectual property rights conceived or created out of the activities conducted under the Collaboration Agreement.
Governance
The development of the programs governed by the Collaboration Agreement is overseen by a six-member joint steering committee, or the JSC, comprised of three representatives from each of us and Gilead. The JSC will oversee the activities carried out pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, including reviewing the research plan for potential amendments, settling disputes arising under the Collaboration Agreement, and approving a Licensed Product as being ready for development. Similarly, the Collaboration Agreement establishes a six-member joint research committee, or the JRC, comprised of three representatives from each of us and Gilead. The JRC will review the research activities conducted by HOOKIPA and Gilead, provide guidance with respect to such research activities, review and discuss the results, status and progress of such research activities, and approve our use of third party subcontractors to perform our tasks under the Collaboration Agreement.
Research on Hepatitis B Virus and HIV products
Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for manufacturing and supplying to Gilead Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus- and Pichinde Virus-based vectors expressing one or more HIV or Hepatitis B Virus antigens to the extent necessary for both us and Gilead to carry out our respective research activities under the 

32



research plans. Hepatitis B Virus antigen-encoding vectors and HIV antigen-carrying vectors used in good laboratory practice, or GLP, studies will be produced at a CMO. We are also responsible during the collaboration term for preparing all non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, reports for inclusion in any IND filing. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, each party is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform its obligations under the Hepatitis B Virus and HIV research plans. Gilead committed to preparations to advance the Hepatitis B Virus and HIV vectors toward clinical entry. To enable the development activities and expanded research programs, Gilead agreed to reserve manufacturing capacity and to expand the reimbursement for our resources allocated to the Gilead collaboration.
​
Development and Commercialization of Hepatitis B Virus and HIV products
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Gilead is solely responsible for conducting the development activities, including all regulatory filings, at its expense for any product arising from the Collaboration Agreement designated for development by Gilead and approved by the JSC. Gilead is also solely responsible, at its expense, for the manufacture and commercialization of any Licensed Product developed and commercialized under the Collaboration Agreement.
Non-Compete
We may not, directly or indirectly, conduct, participate in or fund any research, development, manufacture, or commercialization of, or with respect to products utilizing arenavirus-based vectors for the treatment, cure, diagnosis, or prevention of Hepatitis B Virus or HIV, except for the activities we are expressly permitted to perform under the Collaboration Agreement.
Right of First Negotiation
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, in the event we offer a license or other rights to the Licensed Technology to a third party to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize a Licensed Product outside of the Field before June 4, 2028, we are required to offer Gilead a right of first negotiation for the same rights to the Licensed Technology in such field offered to the third party.
Financial Terms
Upon execution of the Collaboration Agreement, Gilead paid us a one-time upfront fee of $10.0 million and through to December 31, 2020 we received $12.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones. In addition, we have recognized $19.3 million in cost reimbursements for research and development services performed. The Hepatitis B Virus development decision triggered a milestone payment of $4.0 million in February 2020; for the HIV program we are similarly eligible to receive a milestone payment as soon as the agreed milestone is met. Gilead is obligated to pay us a one-time mid seven-digit dollar amount after initiation of the IND-enabling studies for such program and we are eligible for up to $140.0 million in developmental milestone payments for each of the Hepatitis B Virus and HIV programs and $50.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for each of the Hepatitis B Virus and HIV programs. Upon the commercialization of a Licensed Product, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of each Hepatitis B Virus Licensed Product, and royalties of a mid-single-digit to low-teens percentage of worldwide net sales of each HIV Licensed Product. The royalty payments are subject to reduction under specified conditions set forth in the Collaboration Agreement.
 ​
In addition, Gilead is obligated to pay us for all out-of-pocket costs actually incurred by us in connection with the Hepatitis B Virus and HIV programs, including CMO-related costs, to the extent contemplated under the research plans and research budget. In December 2019, Gilead agreed to expand the reimbursement for our resources allocated to the collaboration.
​

33



Termination
Either party may terminate for the uncured breach of the other party and upon the other party filing for bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, or receivership proceedings. On a program-by-program basis, at any time after the expiration or termination of the collaboration term for such program, Gilead may terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to such program or on a product by product or a country by country basis upon prior written notice. If the Collaboration Agreement is not otherwise terminated prior to the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term, upon such expiration the license granted to Gilead will continue in effect, but will be fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable.
Supply Agreement
On December 2020, we entered into a Clinical Supply Agreement with Gilead. Under the terms of the Clinical Supply Agreement, we will provide Gilead with drug product for use in proof-of-concept clinical trials associated with the Licensed Products designated under the Collaboration Agreement. The Company receives reimbursement equal to at an agreed cost in accordance within accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. Clinical supply of a potential Phase 3 clinical trial will be regulated in a separate supply agreement.

We must also pay the NIH 10% of any consideration we receive from sublicensees. We must also pay the NIH low five figure to mid six figure annual royalty payments, increasing as our most developed product candidate manufactured from NIH Licensed Products proceeds through development stages.
Unless earlier terminated, the NIH Agreement remains in effect for a term of 20 years from the effective date. We have the option to extend the term of the agreement for additional one year periods, upon prior notice to the NIH. The NIH may terminate the NIH Agreement if we are in default in performing any material obligation under the NIH Agreement and do not remedy such default within a specified period upon notice thereof. We may terminate the NIH Agreement for convenience upon prior notice.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have made substantial investments in recent years into the rapid development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of a range of pathologies, including infectious diseases and cancers, making this a highly competitive market.

37



We face substantial competition from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed to target various therapeutic areas, such as adoptive cell therapies and active immunization technologies, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge within the field of immunotherapy and, furthermore, within the treatment of infectious diseases and cancers.
In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients with infectious diseases or cancers, numerous commercial and academic preclinical studies and clinical trials are being undertaken by a large number of parties to assess novel technologies and product candidates in the field of immunotherapy. Results from these studies and trials have fueled increasing levels of interest in the field of immunotherapy.
Companies that compete with us directly on the level of the development of product candidates in our therapeutic areas, include, among others:

● | In CMV management, companies such as Helocyte, Inc., VBI Vaccines Inc., Moderna, Inc., SL VaxiGen Inc., and Merck & Co.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In immuno-oncology for HPV+ cancers, companies such as ISA Pharmaceuticals B.V., Moderna, BioNTech, Kite, CureVac, Adaptimmune PLC Transgene, and TCR Cure;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the technology level, other direct competitors which can potentially develop competing product candidates in areas in and outside of HPV16+ cancers and CMV infection such as neoantigens, oncolytic viruses, bispecific antibodies, engineered cell therapies and tumor specific antigens, and other active immunization technologies, include, among others, Gritstone Oncology, Inc., in collaboration with bluebird bio, Inc., Replimune Group, Inc., in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Abalos GmbH, BioNTech, Moderna, Turnstone Biologics Inc., Adaptimmune PLC, CureVac AG, Roche Holdings AG, Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., and Novartis International AG.
Many of our competitors, either alone or in combination with their respective strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through sizeable collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offering. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be product safety, efficacy, convenience and treatment cost.
Manufacturing
We have been establishing robust manufacturing processes, reliable assays and strong supply agreements for all of the components used in our product candidates to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. These include the components for our non-replicating-based and replicating -based product candidates. For GMP production and testing we rely on qualified CMOs to produce and test our clinical material. Currently we do not own or operate manufacturing 

38



facilities beyond laboratory scale non-GMP production. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with cGMP, and all other applicable laws and regulations. Although we plan to establish our own manufacturing facility, we may continue to rely on CMOs for parts of the process, like filling and labelling of our products for commercial sale, to reduce supply risks and cost of goods sold. We continue to build and maintain agreements with manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
We plan to ultimately establish our own manufacturing facility. By complementing CMO capacity with our own manufacturing facility, we aim to balance supply risks, reduce supply cycle time and optimize costs. We believe that having control over the whole manufacturing process will allow us to further increase the robustness and consistency of the process. We expect that control over our own manufacturing facility will also help to shorten overall timelines for new product candidates in our development pipeline, as well as help us develop drug formulations or presentations to simplify distribution as well as administration of future immunotherapeutics. We also believe that having a dedicated manufacturing facility will allow us to optimize commercial-scale processes and to develop a suitable workforce capable of supporting market launch.
As an intermediate step between utilizing selected CMOs for production of clinical trial material, and establishing our own manufacturing facility, we have entered into an agreement with Valneva Sweden AB, or Valneva, a commercial vaccine manufacturer, by which we gain exclusive access to a dedicated GMP facility including qualified workforce for the manufacture and testing of clinical trial material according to our specifications. Valneva capacity significantly increase accessible capacity for HOOKIPA, de-risk clinical supply and accelerate time-to-clinic.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, such as those developed from our non-replicating and replicating technologies and any other product candidates we develop. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates and any future biological product candidates we develop must be approved by the FDA through a biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity and potency. The FDA review and approval process generally involves the following:

1. | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

39




2. | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Submission to the FDA of a BLA;
---+--------------------------------


6. | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal 

40



representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, 

41



quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The BLA may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2020, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is 2,875,842. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is 336,432. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA decides whether to accept a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) as well as other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.

42



Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation for a biologic must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biologic can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic.

43



Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.
Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials as well as other clinical development programs.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and 

44



documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of post-approval problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.
U.S. Healthcare Reform and Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In addition, transparency laws and patient privacy regulations by federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions can apply to the manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of pharmaceutical manufactures. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that can affect a pharmaceutical company’s operations include:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement, including providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label, material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

45




defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;

Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations with respect to certain laws. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions 

46



and settlements in the healthcare industry. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Ensuring our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business.
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court. Additionally, the previous administration issued various Executive Orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, especially given the new administration.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these cuts have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, will be reinstated in April 2021, and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. Further, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.

47



Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates and any future product candidates we develop, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 as part of the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the 

48



licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Union Drug Development
In the European Union, or EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the member state where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other member states through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member state through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member state in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other member state, referred to as the Member States Concerned, for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the member states (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for MA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
European Union Drug Marketing
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union member states, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization as well as the regulatory authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms 

50



ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products, when and if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists in the United States. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, coverage determination is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of biosimilars for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new 

51



formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and reimbursement. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and biologics is a time-consuming and costly process, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Assuming coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of prescribed products.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
