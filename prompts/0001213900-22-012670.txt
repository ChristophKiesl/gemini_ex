ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview



Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Atlas Technical Consultants, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, or “Atlas” and formerly named Boxwood Merger Corp. (“Boxwood”)) is an infrastructure and environmental solutions company and leading provider of professional testing, inspection, engineering, environmental, program management and consulting services, offering solutions to public and private sector clients in the transportation, commercial, water, government, education, industrial, healthcare and power markets. Our customers include government agencies (federal, state and local), quasi-public entities, schools, hospitals, utilities and airports, as well as private sector clients across many industries.



With approximately 145 offices located throughout the United States, we provide a broad range of mission-critical technical services, helping our clients test, inspect, plan, design, certify and manage a wide variety of projects across diverse end markets.



We act as a trusted advisor to our clients, helping clients design, engineer, inspect, manage and maintain civil and commercial infrastructure, including roads and bridges, servicing existing structures as well as helping to build new structures. However, we do not perform any construction and do not take any direct construction risk. As such, our services require limited amounts of capital expenditures.



We provide a broad range of mission-critical technical services, ranging from providing inspection services in small projects to managing significant aspects of large, multi-year projects. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we:




● | performed approximately 40,500 projects, with average revenue per project of $10,000 or less; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delivered approximately 90% of our revenue under “time & materials” and “cost-plus” contracts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We have long-term relationships with a diverse set of clients, providing a base of repeating clients, projects and revenues. Approximately 90% of our revenues were derived from clients that have used our services at least twice in the past three years and more than 95% of our revenues were generated from client relationships longer than ten years, with greater than 25% of revenues generated from relationships longer than thirty years. Examples of such long-term customers include the Georgia and Texas Departments of Transportation, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Gwinnett County Georgia, New York City Housing Authority, Stanford University, Port of Oakland, United Rentals, Inc., Speedway, Walmart Inc., and Apple Inc.




Our services require a high degree of technical expertise, as our clients rely on us to provide testing, inspection and quality assurance services to ensure that structures are designed, engineered, built and maintained in accordance with building codes, regulations and the highest safety standards. As such, our services are delivered by a highly-skilled, technical employee base that includes engineers, inspectors, scientists and other field experts. As of December 31, 2021, our technical staff represented nearly 80% of our approximately 3,450 employees. Our services are typically provided under contracts, some of which are long-term with long lead times between when contracts are signed and when our services are performed. As such, we have a significant amount of contracted backlog, providing for a high degree of visibility with respect to revenues expected to be generated from such backlog. As of December 31, 2021, our contracted backlog was estimated to be approximately $808 million. See “— Backlog” below for additional information relating to our backlog.



For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $538.8 million of gross revenues, ($29.7) million of net (loss), and $73.2 million of adjusted EBITDA.

Company History 



Since our inception, we have strategically strengthened our capabilities and widened our footprint through organic growth and acquisitions of premier national and large regional technical service companies to create an industry-leading platform. Prior to the consummation of the Atlas Business Combination (as defined in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview”), in 2017, we sequentially acquired three regional market leaders in each of Texas (PAVETEX Engineering LLC), Georgia (Moreland Altobelli Associates, LLC), and California (Consolidated Engineering Laboratories (“CEL”)). These businesses established our core services and capabilities. In 2018, we further augmented our core services and regional leadership through the acquisitions of Piedmont Geotechnical Consultants (Georgia) and SCST, Inc. (California). In January 2019, we acquired ATC Group Services LLC, an environmental and engineering consulting services company with over 1,700 employees across North America. In the year-ended December 31, 2020, we acquired: (i) Long Engineering LLC (“LONG”), a land surveying and engineering company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia; (ii) Alta Vista Solutions (“Alta Vista”), a key provider of transportation-related testing and inspection services headquartered in Oakland, California; and (iii) WesTest LLC (“WesTest”), a key provider of transportation-related testing and inspection services headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado. In the year-ended December 31, 2021, we acquired (i) Atlantic Engineering Laboratories, Inc. and Atlantic Engineering Laboratories of New York, Inc. (“AEL”), a full-service materials testing and inspection firm providing on-site quality control and quality assurance services in New York and New Jersey and (ii) O’Neill Services Group (“O’Neill”), a quality assurance and environmental services firm that services clients throughout the Pacific Northwest. As a result of these acquisitions of key providers of technical services, we continue to expand our national platform.



Prior to February 14, 2020, Boxwood was a special purpose acquisition company incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2017. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the Atlas Business Combination pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Following the consummation of the Atlas Business Combination, the combined company is organized in an “Up-C” structure in which the business of Atlas Intermediate Holdings LLC (“Atlas Intermediate”) and its subsidiaries is held by Atlas TC Holdings LLC (“Holdings”) and will continue to operate through the subsidiaries of Atlas Intermediate, and in which the Company’s only direct assets will consist of Holdings Units. The Company is the sole manager of Holdings in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Holdings (the “Holdings LLC Agreement”) entered into in connection with the consummation of the Atlas Business Combination.

Focus on Sustainability and the Environment



As an infrastructure and environmental solutions provider, we are committed to applying our expertise and values to help our clients to improve sustainable infrastructure and ensure a safe and healthy environment through the services we provide. We aim to assist our clients in the effective management of their environmental risks, including those related to climate change, while also minimizing our own environmental footprint.



Through our transportation and infrastructure services, we are committed to the continuous evaluation of opportunities and implementation of solutions to maximize energy efficiency, renewable energy and low-carbon technologies. Additionally, we aim to help our clients manage and respond to climate-related impacts through our disaster response and recovery services, while also contributing to community resiliency through our engineering and design services.



Industry Overview



We operate within the broader U.S. infrastructure services market, providing a diversified set of technical services to a variety of end markets. Services include, but are not limited to, testing, inspection and certification, environmental services, engineering and design and program management, construction management and quality management. The relevant addressable market for U.S. infrastructure and construction testing, inspection and certification (“TIC”) and environmental consulting is an estimated $30 billion and growing. Our clients and projects vary in size and scope and come from all sectors including U.S. federal, state, municipal and local governments, quasi-public and private clients from the education, healthcare and utilities industries, and large multinational corporations and others.



Historically, the infrastructure and construction, TIC and environmental consulting industry have exhibited growth corresponding with market tailwinds, including heightened expenditure on public infrastructure, increasing complexity of regulatory requirements, aging transportation, water and utility systems and growing outsourcing trends among public agencies and private entities. In addition to market tailwinds, the industry has additional growth potential as TIC and quality assurance continue to increase as a percentage of overall construction value.



The following key market tailwinds are expected to drive future demand for U.S. infrastructure and construction TIC and environmental consulting:




● | Aging infrastructure. The majority of U.S. transportation, water and utility networks are over 50 years old, requiring an estimated $5.9 trillion of spending through 2029. Roughly 43% of public roadways in the United States are in poor or mediocre condition, 7.5% of bridges are structurally deficient (and over 94,000 additional bridges nationwide have inadequate clearances or approaches), 70% of all dams will be over 50 years old by 2030 and the majority of the U.S. electric grid was built in the mid-20th century, with an intended lifespan of 50 years. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shift towards outsourcing. Private and public entities are increasingly outsourcing construction and environmental services in an effort to reduce costs, decrease staffing levels, provide specialized solutions and avoid non-compliance. Approximately 40% of testing and inspection services are outsourced, with the overall market for these services growing at approximately 8% year-over-year. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased public spending. Over the past several years, the U.S. Congress has passed legislation aimed at increasing transportation infrastructure spend in key markets. For example, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (the “FAST Act”), passed in 2015, will continue to provide near-term funding support, as the Highway Trust Fund has enough funding to cover large outlays through 2021. Approximately $3.5 trillion in infrastructure funding has been approved through 2029, with approximately $1.37 trillion of that total allocated to surface transportation. Additionally, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law on November 15, 2021, which aims to revamp transportation, utilities and broadband. Included in the law is $550 billion of spending over the next five years with emphasis on roads, bridges, other major transportation projects, passenger and freight rail, public transit, airports and improvements to state and local water quality. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding state & local transportation spend. Combined state and local spending for transportation infrastructure increased from $260 billion in 2014 to a projected $300 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 4% through 2023. The top three states in projected transportation infrastructure spend for 2021, California, New York and Texas, account for approximately 33% of all state and local spending nationwide and represents markets where the Company has a presence. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rising Environmental Expenditures. Health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) regulations have generally become increasingly stringent and complex over time amid heightened awareness of environmental issues by regulatory bodies and consumers. U.S. environmental consulting expenditures are expected to increase from $31 billion in 2020 to $41 billion in 2026. On a major infrastructure project, our services can range between 3-7% of the total project’s cost.

End Markets 



The end markets we serve are characterized by various public and private clients that are faced with deteriorating asset conditions, outdated systems and expanding regulations. We operate across the entire built environment for a variety of end markets including, but not limited to, transportation, commercial, education, industrial, environmental, water, healthcare and power. Each of these end markets are experiencing tailwinds that drive ongoing maintenance and capital investment.



Transportation. The U.S. transportation market has experienced broad increases in federal funding for U.S. Department of Transportation initiatives. Additionally, there is a renewed focus by the current U.S. presidential administration on infrastructure investment and a growing number of government projects focused on roads, bridges and airports. The current installed transportation base is aging and both public and private entities are increasingly outsourcing testing, inspection and program management services for their assets. At the state level, our presence in Georgia, Texas, California and New York positions us to capitalize on the potential increase in infrastructure funding in these states, as these states in particular have historically demonstrated higher than average investment in transportation infrastructure. Illustrative projects in the transportation market include airports, bridges, tollways, railways, highways, waterways, ports, tunnels, pedestrian routes and others.



Commercial. Asset operators are faced with increasing complexity of, and scrutiny around, regulatory requirements, which is driving demand for turnkey solutions and the professionalization of maintenance services. Additionally, corporations are increasing investment in information technology and smart-building features, frequently undergoing corporate relocations, and exhibiting a need for bespoke and unique facilities. The increase in outdated facilities alongside new technological and logistical needs has driven additional spend for warehouse and distribution facilities, as well as development spend across sports, recreation and stadiums. Illustrative projects in the commercial market include healthcare facilities, offices, multi-family properties, retail outlets, data centers, corporate headquarters, parking structures and religious facilities.



Education. Population growth and increasing access to education is driving enrollments and creating a need for new and updated facilities. Academic institutions are placing a growing focus on environmental impacts and sustainability as seen through the implementation of smart- and green-building technologies. Illustrative projects in the education market include colleges, universities, K-12 facilities, service academies, stadiums, athletic facilities, research facilities and theatres.



Industrial and Environmental. New quality, health, safety and environmental regulations are driving demand for compliance systems and services in industrial businesses. Extreme weather requires services such as hurricane, storm and flood clean-up efforts as seen in the Carolinas, Florida and Texas. Illustrative projects in the industrial and environmental markets include manufacturing, refineries, agricultural, utilities, petrochemicals, nuclear, midstream, disaster response and mitigation, and pulp and paper.



Water. Broadening stress on the U.S. water network from outdated systems, population growth and extreme weather patterns has resulted in systems that are approaching the end of their useful lives. The aging water infrastructure must also be renovated to meet expanding government regulations and energy-efficiency standards. Illustrative projects in the water market include dams, levees, recycling facilities, drinking water, storage, inland waterways, wastewater and treatment plants.



Government. Over time, municipalities, local, state and federal governments are increasingly tasked with the mandate to operate on leaner, more efficient budgets. We understand the many challenges associated with development, transportation and land-use for the government sector and we use our in-depth knowledge of social, political, and economic conditions to deliver sustainable projects to the communities that we serve. We partner with our clients and all stakeholders to ensure the cost-effective use of public funds and deliver better public infrastructure projects from concept to completion. Illustrative projects include program, construction and quality management projects for county, state and federal governments, disaster relief coordination and engineering and design of roadways and bridges.



Healthcare. From acute care hospitals to alcohol and drug treatment units, we provide services to assist our clients’ compliance with the Joint Commission Environment of Care, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other applicable regulatory standards. Our nationwide network enables us to mobilize quickly, often avoiding disruption to our clients’ staff and patient populations. Illustrative projects include asset tagging, compliance assessment and permitting, construction materials testing, and site assessments.



Power. Whether our clients are considering new generation development, movement away from unregulated markets with renewed investment in regulated transmission and distribution, or retirement of older, less efficient generating assets, we understand the complexities of grid improvement and expansion projects and are poised to provide services such as siting and corridor studies, permitting, and real estate/right-of-way acquisition support. We assist our clients in determining where to add capacity, plan for construction, or build a new power plant, solar array, or wind turbine field. After construction, we are positioned to support the long-term safe and regulatory compliant operation of power assets. Illustrative projects include renewable development support services, environmental services, compliance assessment and permitting and construction management.

Key Clients and Projects



We currently serve over 10,000 different clients annually. While our ten largest clients accounted for approximately 19% of our consolidated revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, no single client accounted for more than 10% during that period. Although we serve a highly diverse client base, approximately 50% of our net revenues were attributable to public and quasi-public sector clients. In this regard, public sector clients include U.S. federal, state and local government departments, agencies, systems and authorities, including Departments of Transportation, educational systems and public housing authorities, while quasi-public sector clients include utility service providers and energy producers. Of our private sector clients, our largest clients are commercial companies and contractors. Although we anticipate public and quasi-public sector clients to represent the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future, we intend to continue expanding our service offerings to private sector clients.



During our history in the testing and inspection business, we have worked with such clients on such well-known projects as (in alphabetical order):

Contracts



We enter into contracts that contain two principal types of pricing provisions: (1) time and materials/cost-reimbursable; and (2) fixed price. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 90% of our revenue was recognized from time and materials/cost-reimbursable contracts, with approximately 10% from fixed price contracts.



Cost-reimbursable contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts consist of the following:




● | “Time & materials” contracts are common for smaller scale professional and technical consulting and certification service projects. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined fee. Instead, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based upon actual hours expended on a project. In addition, any direct project expenditures are passed through to the client and are typically reimbursed. These contracts may have an initial not-to-exceed or guaranteed maximum price provision. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Cost-plus” contracts are the predominant contracting method used by U.S. federal, state and local governments. Under these types of contracts, we charge clients for our costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a negotiated fee. The estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Fixed price. Fixed price contracts consist of the following:




● | Fixed price contracts require us to either perform all of the work under the contract for a specified lump sum or to perform an estimated number of units of work at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment determined by the actual number of units performed. Fixed price contracts are subject to price adjustments if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen conditions arise. Fixed price contracts expose us to a number of risks not inherent in “cost-plus” and “time & materials” contracts, including underestimation of costs, ambiguities in specifications, unforeseen costs or difficulties, problems with new technologies, delays beyond our control, failures of subcontractors to perform and economic or other changes that may occur during the contract period. Many of our fixed price contracts relate to small value services, such as individual unit or very small quantity testing or inspection. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Revenues from engineering services are recognized in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues under cost-reimbursable contracts are recognized when services are performed or over time.



Backlog



As of December 31, 2021, we had $808 million of backlog, of which $485 million, or approximately 60%, is expected to be recognized over the next twelve months and the majority of the balance over the next 24 months.


We analyze our backlog, which we define to include the total estimated future revenue streams associated with fully executed contracts as well as an estimate of highly probable revenues from recurring, task order-based contracts. Our contracted backlog includes revenue we expect to record in the future from signed contracts. In order to calculate backlog, we determine the amounts for contracted projects that are fully funded, and then determine the respective revenues expected to be realized upon completion of work. We use backlog to evaluate Company revenue growth as it typically follows growth in backlog. As backlog is not a defined accounting term, our computation of backlog may not be comparable with that of our peers. In addition, project cancellations and scope adjustments may occur from time to time. For example, certain contracts are terminable at the discretion of the client, with or without cause. These types of backlog reductions could adversely affect our revenue and margins. Our backlog for the period beyond the next twelve months may be subject to variation from the prior year as existing contracts are completed, delayed or renewed or new contracts are awarded, delayed or canceled. In addition, our contracts may contain option periods which must be evaluated. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings.

Offices



Our principal executive offices are located at 13215 Bee Cave Parkway, Building B, Suite 230, Austin, Texas 78738, which we have leased through October 2024 with annual lease terms of $0.4 million plus operating expenses over the life of the lease. We do not own any significant real property. We currently operate out of approximately 145 leased locations. Our lease terms vary from month-to-month to multi-year commitments. We do not consider any of these leased properties to be materially important to our overall operations. While we do believe it is necessary to maintain offices through which our services are coordinated, we feel there are an ample number of available office rental properties that could adequately serve our needs should we need to relocate or expand our operations.

Human Capital Management



At Atlas, our employees are our assets; they are the very foundation of our success, the heart of our organization and the drivers of our future potential. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,450 employees, approximately 85% of which were full-time employees and approximately 80% of which represent technical staff with specialized expertise such as engineers, inspectors, scientists and other field experts. We consider our employee relations to be good.



Our employee attrition rate for 2021 among all staff, part-time and full-time, was approximately 20%. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed  and we do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel. However, our ability to attract, retain, engage and support a diverse and highly qualified workforce is essential to our future success. As such, we prioritize diversity within our employee population and proactively foster a culture of inclusion throughout our organization, and we place the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees above all else.



Focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion



To achieve our vision we seek to hire, develop, and promote a talented and diverse team of professionals nationwide. We believe leveraging the power of our different backgrounds, beliefs, perspectives and capabilities creates value for our Company and our shareholders.

At Atlas, we define diversity, equity and inclusion as follows:




● | Diversity is the presence of employees of different gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, socio-economic status, and physical/mental abilities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equity is the promotion of impartiality and fairness within procedures, processes, distribution of resources, and access to promotion and development. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inclusion is an ongoing commitment to ensure all Atlas employees experience a welcoming work environment that is devoid of discrimination and bias. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the third quarter of 2020, we formed the Atlas Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (the “DE&I Council”) comprised of employee representatives from varying backgrounds, geographic regions, functional groups and levels of seniority within our organization to focus on diversity, equity and inclusion strategy development, initiative execution and measurement of outcomes. The DE&I Council’s work is streamlined into three targeted programs: Employee Resources, Talent & Training and Community Outreach.



In the first quarter of 2021, we appointed Jamie Myers as our Chief Diversity Officer and launched seven employee resource groups (“ERGs”), which are voluntary, employee-led groups that strive to foster a diverse, inclusive workplace aligned with our core values. Our ERGs exist to provide support, career development and networking opportunities as well as create a safe space where employees can be their authentic selves. Each ERG is open to all employees and cross-collaboration across ERGs is encouraged. When we work together to foster an open, diverse workplace, mentoring and support can reshape our inclusive culture.

The overall wellbeing, including the mental health, of our employees is of utmost important to us. We provide an Employee Assistance Program free of charge to all employees, through which a third party provider offers confidential guidance for personal issues that employees may be facing, including substance abuse, mental health, work, familial, financial and legal matters.



Competition



The U.S. infrastructure and construction TIC and environmental consulting market is generally highly fragmented and competitive due to the breadth of services offered and the technical complexity needed to meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards.



Industry participants compete on the strength of client relationships, expertise in local markets, technical capabilities, reputation for quality of service and reliability, and price. The ability to compete effectively also depends on employing highly skilled, qualified personnel to meet technical qualification and staffing requirements.



Barriers to entry in the industry are created by the requirement for technical capabilities, a reputation for expertise and reliability and deep relationships with both clients and prime contractors. Scale and breadth of service offerings can also be a barrier to entry for companies that do not have adequate resources or capacity to complete complex and large-scale projects. Customers are increasingly emphasizing safe work practices by placing a premium on limiting liability, creating an additional barrier to entry for those who cannot demonstrate a safety record at or above industry standards.



The firms operating in our industry range from large, global companies with broad service offerings to small-scale providers that typically service regional markets or offer specialized, niche services. Competitive dynamics in the industry are variable across end markets, localities, geographies and types and scopes of services, among other factors. With respect to engineering and design, we view our principal competitors to be AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., NV5 Global, Inc., Parsons Corporation, Stantec Inc., Tetra Tech, Inc. and WSP Global Inc. In the area of testing and inspection, we view our principal competitors to be Applus Services, S.A., ALS Limited, Bureau Veritas S.A., Intertek Group plc and SGS S.A. With respect to professional services, we view our principal competitors to be Accenture plc, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., CGI Inc., FTI Consulting, Inc., Huron Consulting Group Inc. and ICF International, Inc. In all of the aforementioned industries there are also other small- and mid-sized regional players with whom we compete. Our ability to compete successfully depends upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the strength of our client relationships, our ability to accurately estimate costs, the quality of the work we perform, our ability to hire and train qualified personnel and our ability to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms.

Seasonality



Due primarily to inclement weather conditions, which lead to project delays and slower completion of contracts, and a greater number of holidays in the United States, our operating results during the months of December, January and February are generally lower than our operating results during other months. As a result, our revenue and net income for the first and fourth quarters of a fiscal year may be lower than our results for the second and third quarters of a fiscal year.
Insurance and Risk Management



We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury and property damage. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles and reserves to be adequate. Wherever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety and similar methods.



Risk management is an integral part of project management. We have a strict project review framework including escalation to senior management for any fixed price contracts above $5 million.



Regulation



We are regulated in a number of fields in which we operate. We contract with various U.S. governmental agencies and entities, and when working with such governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things:

● | require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impose procurement regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-based U.S. government contracts; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.



Legal and Environmental



From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise out of our normal course of business or otherwise. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, are expected to materially impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, taken as a whole.



We must comply with a number of federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, or that otherwise relate to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs, including clean-up costs; fines and administrative, civil or criminal sanctions; third-party claims for property damage or personal injury; or implementation of remediation activities, including investigation, assessment and short- or long-term monitoring activities.
