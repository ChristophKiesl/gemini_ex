ITEM 1.      BUSINESS
Overview
 
Founded in 1932 and incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ethan Allen Global, Inc., and Ethan Allen Global, Inc.’s subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ethan Allen” or the “Company”), is a leading interior design company, manufacturer and retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. We are a global luxury home fashion brand that is vertically integrated from product design through home delivery, which offers our customers stylish product offerings, artisanal quality, and personalized service.

We also own and operate nine manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Mexico, and Honduras, including one sawmill, one rough mill and a lumberyard. Approximately 75% of our products are manufactured or assembled in these North American facilities. We also contract with various suppliers located in Europe, Asia, and various other countries that produce products that support our business.
 
Business Strategy
 
We strive to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term through executing on our strategic initiatives.

We continuously monitor changes in home fashion trends through industry events and fashion shows, internal market research, and regular communication with our retailers and design center design professionals who provide valuable input on consumer trends. We believe that the observations and input gathered enable us to incorporate appropriate style details into our products to react quickly to changing customer tastes.
 
Our strong network of North American interior design professionals continues to create design solutions that best satisfy our customers’ needs. We believe changes in consumer spending and new habits being formed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has created opportunities for our brand.

With the 3D Room Planner, our designers generate both 2D floor plans and immersive, realistic 3D walk-throughs of the interior designs they create. These technologies have been pivotal to our ability to serve clients remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic and increase our e-commerce business. With so much of our product customizable, we encourage our website customers to get personal help from our interior design professionals either in person or by chatting online with one of our qualified design professionals. This complimentary direct contact with one of our knowledgeable interior design professionals, whether remotely or in-person, creates a competitive advantage as well as enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming customers of our network of interior design centers. In the past year we have seen our e-commerce net sales grow 88% over the prior year as we have increased our use of technology that better allows clients to shop with confidence.

Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid ongoing spread of COVID-19 within the United States and around the world, federal, state and local governments imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Such measures included quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and directives, restrictions on travel, and closures of non-essential businesses, which included many sectors within retail commerce.
Timeline. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and for the protection of our employees and customers, we implemented, and continue to monitor, certain business continuity plans to ensure the ongoing availability of our products and services, while prioritizing health and safety measures, including enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”). Beginning in our third quarter of fiscal 2020, we took the following actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
Fiscal 2020
 

● | Temporarily closed our Company-operated retail design centers and manufacturing facilities
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $100 million under our existing revolving credit facility to increase our cash position as a precautionary measure and to maximize financial flexibility
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Announced our comprehensive action plan, which included both enhanced health and safety protocols with cost-saving initiatives; measures taken included, the furlough of 70% of our global workforce, the decision by our CEO to temporarily forego his salary, a temporary reduction in salaries of up to 40% for all senior management and up to 20% for other salaried employees, a temporary reduction of 50% in the cash compensation of the Company’s directors, the elimination of all non-essential operating expenses, a delay of capital expenditures, negotiated alternative terms for lease payments, reduced inventory purchases, temporarily eliminated our regular quarterly dividend and suspended purchases under our existing share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2020, we began reopening design centers in a number of U.S. states as well as resumed production in our North American manufacturing plants in a limited capacity
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Repaid $50 million of our outstanding borrowings under our existing credit facility using available cash on hand in June 2020
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fiscal 2021
 

● | All temporary salary reductions were lifted, effective July 1, 2020, and the majority of our associates previously furloughed returned
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All of our Company-operated retail design centers and manufacturing facilities fully reopened
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors” or “Board”) reinstated the regular quarterly dividend in August 2020 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share, paid in October 2020
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Repaid the remaining $50 million of our outstanding borrowings leaving no remaining debt
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Impact on Health and Safety. The start of our fiscal 2021 year was during the COVID-19 pandemic and our foremost focus was and has continued to be operating safely for our employees and clients. In response to COVID-19, we implemented certain business continuity plans and health and safety measures to ensure the ongoing availability of our services, while also protecting our employees and customers. Such measures included temporarily closing of our design centers and most of our manufacturing plants during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, implementing enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols as recommended by the CDC, and implementing remote work policies for our employees, wherever possible. As we worked to safely reopen our design centers and other facilities, we put COVID-19 prevention protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces. These protocols, which remain in place, meet or exceed the CDC guidelines and where applicable, state mandates. Our employees were trained on these protocols prior to or upon returning to work. We established logistics for the supply of hand sanitizer and related dispensers, disinfectant cleaning supplies and masks and nitrile gloves, increased ventilation and air filtration, instituted physical distance requirements, where applicable, and increased the cleaning frequency. We also work closely with our associates to identify team members who were in close contact with an ill colleague in the workplace and instituted procedures to help contain the spread of COVID-19. As of June 30, 2021, we have been fortunate to experience a limited number of cases of COVID-19 throughout our enterprise, each of which resulted in no significant disruptions to our operations.

Impact on the Supply Chain. We have seen a significant improvement in business conditions, which has contributed to our increased profitability and strong positive cash flow during fiscal 2021. Tempering these improvements are the continuing logistical challenges that we, as well as the entire home furnishings industry, have faced resulting from COVID-19-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions creating significant delays in order fulfillment and increasing order backlogs. We continue to focus on our inventory and supply chain management as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory shortage and obsolescence. We continue to produce about 75% of our products in our North American manufacturing facilities with the remaining 25% being sourced primarily from Southeast Asia and China. The receipt of inventory and raw materials imported from these areas has been slowed or disrupted. In addition, ocean freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide, which has resulted in price increases per shipping container. We continue to manage and evaluate our logistics providers, but believe that ocean freight container rates will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the near-term.
Impact on Raw Material Prices. During fiscal 2021, the prices of materials we use in our upholstery manufacturing process, such as foam and springs, and in our case goods manufacturing process, such as logs and lumber, increased due to COVID-19 related supply chain challenges that limited supply during a time of higher demand for raw materials in various manufacturing sectors, including the home building and home furnishings industries due to increased consumer purchasing and inflationary cost pressure. COVID-19 and weather-related disruptions led to temporary shortages of foam and springs in fiscal 2021. The short-term dynamics of supply and demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a surge in new homes and renovations, also resulted in lumber prices significantly increasing across North America during fiscal 2021. While we have recently begun to see foam, springs, lumber and other raw material prices come down from historic highs, we expect raw material prices to remain at high levels in many categories due to price inflation and global supply chain complexities. COVID-19 related issues will continue to introduce uncertainty into many markets. To the extent that we experience incremental raw material price increases, we may increase our selling prices or assess material surcharges to offset the impact. However, increases in selling prices, or surcharges, may not fully mitigate the impact of raw material cost increases which would adversely impact operating profits.
Impact on Backlog. During fiscal 2021, we have experienced unprecedented demand driving a 31.7% increase in wholesale written orders, which has outpaced our production. The strong product demand, coupled with COVID-19 related production challenges, including manufacturing shutdowns, plant absenteeism, material shortages and shipping delays resulted in extended lead times between order and delivery. Our wholesale backlog growth was due to wholesale orders booked of $471.1 million compared with net sales of $413.1 million. As a result, our wholesale backlog was at a record level of $120.0 million as of June 30, 2021, up 88.1% from a year ago. We will continue to work through this existing order backlog during fiscal 2022, but are unable to reasonably predict the timing and size of reductions to our backlog.
Impact on Seasonality. During the last two fiscal years our sales volume and production schedules did not follow typical trends due to the impact of COVID-19. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, COVID-19 led us to temporarily closing our retail design centers and manufacturing facilities, which resulted in a significant decline in net sales that continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. After reopening all of our retail design centers and manufacturing facilities by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we have continued to see an increase in demand for our products and services. However, this increased demand has been partially offset by supply chain disruptions and shipping container availability, which limited our ability to fully ramp up production throughout fiscal 2021. We experienced our largest sales volume during the third quarter in our wholesale business and fourth quarter in our retail business. We believe this fiscal 2021 experience was not an indicator that our seasonal trends are changing and was primarily due to disruptions in the market caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of fiscal 2021. Additionally, in fiscal 2022 we do not anticipate a return to typical trends due to our record order backlog as of June 30, 2021.
Continued Monitoring. We continue to frequently monitor and re-evaluate our COVID-19 action plan based on guidance from the CDC, regulators and other health and safety organizations. We believe that we have a strong balance sheet with $104.6 million of cash and no bank debt as of June 30, 2021, which we believe will provide sufficient liquidity to continue business operations in the long-term. Although we continue to actively manage the impact of COVID-19 and the prospect of continuing or future outbreaks, we are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial operations in the near- and long-term. We also continue to actively manage our global supply chain and manufacturing operations, which may continue to be adversely impacted with respect to availability and pricing based on uncontrollable factors.

Product 
 
The majority of the products we sell are built by artisans in our North American plants. Most upholstery frames are hand-assembled and stitching is guided by hand. All case goods frames are made with premium lumber and veneers. We use best-in-class construction techniques, including mortise and tenon joinery and four-corner glued dovetail joinery on drawers. These factors continue to define Ethan Allen, positioning us as a quality and fashion leader in the home furnishing industry.
 
The interior of our design centers are organized to facilitate display of our product offerings, both in room settings that project the category lifestyle, and by product grouping to facilitate comparisons of the styles and tastes of our customers. To further enhance the experience, we use technology to expand the range of products viewed by including content from our website and 3D digital images in applications used on large touch-screen flat panel displays.
 
Product Development
 
Using a combination of employees and designers, we design and build the majority of the products we sell. All of our products are Ethan Allen branded. This important facet of our vertically integrated business enables us to control the design specifications and establish consistent levels of quality across all our product programs. In addition to our six United States manufacturing facilities, we have two upholstery manufacturing plants in Mexico and a case goods manufacturing facility in Honduras. We selectively outsource the remaining 25% of our products, primarily from Asia. We carefully select our sourcing partners and require strict compliance with our specifications, quality and social responsibility standards. We believe that our strategic investments in our manufacturing facilities balanced with outsourcing from foreign and domestic suppliers will enable us to accommodate any significant future sales growth and allow us to maintain an appropriate degree of control over cost, quality and service to our customers.
Raw Materials and Supply Chain
 
The most important raw materials we use in manufacturing are lumber, veneers, plywood, hardware, glue, finishing materials, glass, laminates, steel, fabrics, foam, and filling material. The various types of wood used in our products include cherry, ash, oak, maple, prima vera, African mahogany, birch, rubber wood and poplar.
 
Fabrics and other raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We have no significant long-term supply contracts and believe we have sufficient alternate sources of supply to prevent significant long-term disruption in supplying our operations, despite the availability pressures of raw materials due to COVID-19, as described further below. Appropriate amounts of lumber and fabric inventory are typically stocked to maintain adequate production levels. We believe that our sources of supply for these materials are sufficient and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. We have been able to reduce our exposure to any one particular country or manufacturing hub through our unique vertical integration, which allows us to make approximately 75% of our products within our own North American manufacturing plants. This manufacturing structure leaves us with limited exposure to any one particular country on the other 25% that we import. We enter into standard purchase agreements with foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf. We select international partners who are as committed to quality and social responsibility as we are. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers.
 
While we strive to maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, the impact of COVID-19 on raw materials and increased demand on our supply chain has created additional pricing and availability pressures. During fiscal 2021, the prices of materials we use in our upholstery manufacturing process, such as foam and springs, and in our case goods manufacturing process, such as logs and lumber, increased due to COVID-19 related supply chain challenges, higher demand for raw materials in manufacturing sectors, including the home furnishings industry, and inflationary cost pressure. Lumber prices and availability can also fluctuate over time based on various factors, including supply and demand and new home construction. The cost of some of our raw materials such as foam and shipping costs are also dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins.
 
We expect raw material prices to remain at historically high levels in many categories during fiscal 2022 due to price inflation in certain raw materials and global supply chain complexities. COVID-19 related issues will continue to introduce uncertainty into many markets, especially with respect to freight and labor availability. To the extent that we experience incremental costs in any of these areas, we may increase our selling prices or assess material surcharges to offset the impact. However, increases in selling prices, or surcharges, may not fully mitigate the impact of raw material cost increases which would adversely impact operating income. Further, given our current backlog, described further below, we anticipate delays in the realization of pricing actions due to the timing difference between written orders and the recognition of sales upon delivery.

Marketing
 
Ethan Allen’s marketing mission statement, “We Make the American HomeTM,” capitalizes on our core brand values of quality and craftsmanship, combining personal service with technology, and a commitment to social responsibility. We amplify those values through our dynamic brand story, The Journey of American Style. Told across our three predominant lifestyles of Classic, Country & Coastal, and Modern, this brand story honors our history as a quintessential American brand while empowering us to promote a broad yet curated range of products, which results in a superlative combination of product value and personal service.
 
By adopting a fresh, ever-evolving creative approach, increasingly driven by digital strategies, we have continually reinvigorated our brand, enhancing its desirability and visibility. Our vertically integrated approach to business is one of our key competitive advantages. Because we make 75% of our products in our own North American workshops, we believe we have greater control over quality and serviceability, and we make products to order, supporting an exceptional breadth of styles and custom options.  
 
Our combination of creative and analytics-driven strategies enables us to drive both new and repeat client traffic, both to over 300 design centers worldwide and to our website, ethanallen.com. Using our fully integrated customer relationship management system, we create personalized customer journeys, targeted communications, and retargeting campaigns. We develop persuasive, aspirational, and relevant messaging, and we convey it through a variety of media, including direct mail, national and local TV and radio, digital and social channels, and email marketing. We also launched an aggressive and targeted digital communications strategy in 2021 that significantly increases our prospecting contacts annually. Taken together, these strategies ensure that we are constantly adding to and refreshing our client base while retaining existing relationships.
 
Once clients reach any point of purchase, we offer enticing financing options through the Ethan Allen Platinum Card, a third party-administered consumer credit program. Designed to make Ethan Allen accessible to everyone, the card continues to attract both new and recurring clients, driven by our strong financing programs, which has helped increase both conversion rates and average transaction.
 
E-Commerce
 
At Ethan Allen, our e-commerce strategy is to generate business by combining technology with excellent personal service. We consider our website an extension of our retail design centers and not a separate segment of our business. Most clients will use the internet for inspiration and as a start to their shopping process to view products and prices. Though our customers have the opportunity to buy our products online, we take the process further. With so much of our product customizable, we encourage our website customers to get personal help from our interior design professionals either in person or by chatting online with one of our qualified design professionals. This complimentary direct contact with one of our knowledgeable interior design professionals, whether remotely or in-person, creates a competitive advantage through our excellent personal service. This enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming customers of our network of interior design centers.
 
Particularly as a result of the increased focus on online shopping and virtual merchandise platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to strategically focus on e-commerce, through our ongoing implementation of conversion rate optimization updates. We also invest in targeted search engine optimization and paid search marketing, for both national and local markets, driving both referral traffic to our website and physical traffic to our design centers. In addition, improved on-site search capabilities, expanded Live Chat services, online appointment booking capability, and product listing and display page enhancements continue to elevate the user experience. We continue to promote brand visibility on various social media platforms, placing a greater emphasis on visual and video-driven content. Both paid social media campaigns and an ​organic social media presence have helped us grow our social following and take a more prominent place in the cultural conversation. 
 
Our website traffic, as expected, increased dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic as people spent more time in their homes. E-commerce retail written orders during fiscal 2021 increased 57.9%. However, as the fiscal year progressed, we saw a shift in traffic, from our website to in-person at the design center as more people felt comfortable outside of the home. Our total e-commerce net sales for fiscal 2021 were up 87.5% over the year ago period, but remained less than 5% of our total consolidated net sales.
 
We plan to further invest in our digital footprint, including our website, in order to enhance our customer experience. We are also continually improving our customers’ journey from the time they land on our website to the delivery of their purchase through our white glove home delivery service. We view the combination of online traffic and design center traffic in a holistic fashion whereby our customer generally experiences our brand on our website before visiting a design center in person. Our online traffic continues to increase each year and our marketing teams remain focused on enhancing our digital outreach strategies to further drive more traffic and keep our brand relevant in today’s social media oriented world.

The Client Experience
 
We have greatly enhanced the client experience both in our design centers, as well as online by investing in digital design technologies over the past several years. EA inHome®, our augmented reality mobile app, empowers clients to preview Ethan Allen products in their homes, at scale, in a variety of fabrics and finishes. With the 3D Room Planner, our clients and designers generate both 2D floor plans and immersive, incredibly realistic 3D walk-throughs of the designs they create.  Both technologies have been pivotal to our ability to offer clients a variety of touchpoints for design conversations; clients can easily work with designers in our design centers, at their homes, or online. We have also developed a virtual design center experience, which enables clients to shop within a virtual Ethan Allen showroom, receive detailed product information, and collaborate with an Ethan Allen designer within the virtual showroom. 
Segments
 
We have strategically aligned our business into two reportable segments: wholesale and retail. Our operating segments are aligned with how the Company, including our chief operating decision maker, manages the business. These two segments represent strategic business areas of our vertically integrated enterprise that operate separately and provide their own distinctive services. This vertical structure enables us to offer our complete line of home furnishings and accents while better controlling quality and cost. We evaluate performance of the respective segments based upon net sales and operating income. Intersegment transactions result, primarily, from the sale of wholesale inventory to the retail segment, including the related profit margin. Financial information, including sales, operating income and long-lived assets related to our segments are disclosed in Note 19, Segment Information, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
As of June 30, 2021, the Company operated 141 design centers (our retail segment) and our independent retailers operated 161 design centers. Our wholesale segment’s net sales include sales to our retail segment, which are eliminated in consolidation, and sales to external customers (our independent retailers and other unaffiliated third parties). Our retail segment net sales accounted for 81.0% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021. Our wholesale segment net sales accounted for the remaining 19.0%.
 
The following charts depict net sales related to our two reportable segments.
 


Retail Segment
 
The retail segment, which accounted for 81% of net sales during fiscal 2021, sells home furnishings and accents to clients through a network of 141 Company-operated design centers. Ethan Allen design centers are typically located in busy retail settings as freestanding destinations or as part of town centers, lifestyle centers, and suburban shopping malls, and average approximately 14,700 square feet in size with 59% of them ranging between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet, 26% being less than 10,000 square feet and the remaining 15% being greater than 20,000 square feet. Over the past 10 years, 50% of our design centers are new or have been relocated as we continually evaluate our retail footprint. Other initiatives include regularly updating presentations and floor plans, strengthening the qualifications of our designers through training and certifications and combining technology with personal service in our design centers, which has also allowed us to reduce the size of our design centers. In the past five years, we have either opened or relocated a total of 22 new design centers with an average size of 9,900 square feet. These smaller footprint design centers reflect our shift from destination and shopping mall locations to lifestyle centers that better project our brand and offer increased traffic opportunities.

Retail segment revenue is generated upon the sale and delivery of our products to our retail customers through our network of home delivery centers. Retail profitability reflects (i) the retail gross margin, which represents the difference between the retail net sales price and the cost of goods, purchased from the wholesale segment, and (ii) other operating costs associated with retail segment activities. We measure the performance of our design centers primarily based on net sales and operating income on a comparable period basis. The frequency of our promotional events as well as the timing of the end of those events can affect the comparability of net sales during a given period. Due to the nature of the business in which the retail segment operates, there are no customer concentration risks.
 
The retail segment’s product line revenue, expressed as a percentage of net sales, is comprised of approximately 51% in upholstered products, 28% case goods and the remaining 21% in home accents and other.
 
During fiscal 2021, we opened three new design centers, including two which were relocations, and closed six. The geographic distribution of our retail design center locations is disclosed under Item 2, Properties, contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Wholesale Segment
 
The wholesale segment, which accounted for 19% of net sales during fiscal 2021, is principally involved in the development of the Ethan Allen brand and encompasses all aspects of design, manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, sale and distribution of our broad range of home furnishings and accents. Wholesale revenue is generated upon the sale and shipment of our products to our retail network of independently operated design centers, Company-operated design centers, and other third-party contract business customers. Our ten largest customers were all within our wholesale segment and accounted for 22% of sales within our wholesale segment during fiscal 2021. These customers were the United States government General Services Administration (“GSA”) and nine independent retailers.
 
Within the wholesale segment, we record revenue information according to each respective product line (i.e. case goods, upholstery and home accents). Case goods include items such as beds, dressers, armoires, tables, chairs, buffets, entertainment units, home office furniture and wooden accents. Upholstery items include sleepers, recliners and other motion furniture, chairs, ottomans, custom pillows, sofas, loveseats, cut fabrics and leather. Skilled artisans cut, sew and upholster custom-designed upholstery items which are available in a variety of frame, fabric and trim options. Home accent items include window treatments and drapery hardware, wall décor, florals, lighting, clocks, mattresses, bedspreads, throws, pillows, decorative accents, area rugs, wall coverings and home and garden furnishings.
 
Wholesale profitability includes (i) the wholesale gross margin, which represents the difference between the wholesale net sales price and the cost associated with manufacturing and/or sourcing the related product, and (ii) other operating costs associated with wholesale segment activities. The wholesale segment’s product line revenue, expressed as a percentage of net sales, is comprised of approximately 52% in upholstered products, 30% case goods and the remaining 18% in home accents and other.
 
Our independent retailers are required to enter into license agreements with us, which (i) authorize the use of certain Ethan Allen trademarks and (ii) require adherence to certain standards of operation, including a requirement to fulfill related warranty service agreements. We are not subject to any territorial or exclusive retailer agreements in North America.
 
The geographic distribution of manufacturing and distribution locations is disclosed under Item 2, Properties, contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Seasonality
 
We believe that the demand for home furnishings generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, discretionary spending, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, debt levels, retail trends and unemployment rates. In a typical year, we schedule production to maintain consistent manufacturing activity throughout the year whenever possible. We typically shut down our domestic plants for one week at the beginning of each fiscal year to perform routine maintenance. For both our segments, historically no one particular fiscal quarter contributes more than 27% of annual sales volume, thus limiting our exposure to seasonality.
 
During the last two fiscal years, our sales volume and production schedules did not follow the aforementioned typical trends due to the impact of COVID-19. For further discussion on these changes, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business section further above.

Backlog
 
We define backlog as any written order received that has not yet been delivered. Our wholesale backlog consists of written orders received from our retail network of independently operated design centers, Company-operated design centers, and other contract business customers that have not yet been delivered. Our retail backlog is undelivered written orders associated with end retail customers. Stock replenishment orders not associated with a specific end customer are excluded from backlog. Our backlog fluctuates based on the timing of net orders booked, manufacturing schedules and efficiency, the timing of sourced product receipts, the timing and volume of shipments, and the timing of various promotional events. Historically, the size of our backlog at a given time varies and may not be indicative of our future sales, and therefore, we do not rely entirely on backlogs to predict future sales.
 
During fiscal 2021 our orders significantly outpaced our production, which led to a record level of backlog as of June 30, 2021. For further discussion on the material increase in backlog, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business section further above.
 
Distribution and Logistics
 
We distribute our products through three national distribution centers, owned by the Company, strategically located in North Carolina and Virginia. These distribution centers provide efficient cross-dock operations to receive and ship product from our manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers to our retail network of Company and independently operated retail home delivery centers. Retail home delivery centers prepare products for delivery into customers’ homes. At June 30, 2021, our Company-operated retail design centers were supported by 16 Company-operated retail home delivery centers and 11 home delivery centers operated by third parties.
 
The majority of our products are manufactured on a custom made-to-order basis. We also stock certain case goods, upholstery and home accents to provide for quick delivery of in-stock items and to allow for more efficient production runs. We utilize independent carriers to ship our products.
 
Our practice has been to sell our products at the same delivered cost to all Company and independently operated design centers throughout the United States, regardless of their shipping point. This policy creates pricing credibility with our wholesale customers while providing our retail segment the opportunity to achieve more consistent margins by removing fluctuations attributable to the cost of shipping. Further, this policy eliminates the need for our independent retailers to carry significant amounts of inventory in their own warehouses. As a result, we obtain more accurate consumer product demand information.
 
Human Capital Management
 
At June 30, 2021, our employee count totaled 4,188, with 3,036 employees in our wholesale segment and 1,152 in our retail segment. Our employee count represents an increase from 3,369 a year ago, which can be attributed to the increase in production at our manufacturing facilities combined with 37.8% growth in retail headcount to support the heightened demand. The prior year headcount of 3,369 was significantly lower than historical levels due to actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to reduce our workforce in response to COVID-19. The majority of our employees are employed on a full-time basis and we believe we maintain good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages. In managing our business, we focus on a number of key human capital measures and objectives, which are rooted in our core values and include the following items:
Culture and Values
 
Since our founding, we have aimed to build a collaborative culture that emphasizes treating people with dignity and respect while offering employees a variety of opportunities and experiences. After almost nine decades in business, we believe the name “Ethan Allen” is well-known and highly regarded in the home furnishings marketplace. Our employees are vital to our success and are one of the main reasons we continue to execute at a high level. We believe our employees have an entrepreneurial spirit, a passion for style, a drive for excellence, outstanding communication skills and create a culture that embraces creativity, integrity, diversity, innovation and inclusion of people from all backgrounds. Our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality products and services to our customers.

Diversity and Inclusion
 
Diversity and inclusion are two of our core values, as we recognize that our employees’ unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives enable us to create and deliver the best-quality product and provide outstanding service to meet the needs of our customer base. We believe in creating and fostering a workplace in which all our employees feel valued, included and empowered to do their best work and contribute their ideas and perspectives. We are committed to recruiting and retaining diverse talent so that our workforce better reflects the communities in which we live and work. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives include developing impactful practices to advance our Company’s diversity and inclusion, supporting diversity awareness across our organization, maintaining an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment, and continuing to offer our employees multiple avenues through which to report inappropriate behavior, including our confidential whistleblower hotline.
Health and Safety
 
Ethan Allen is committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees. We care about our employee, customers, and the communities we serve. We have a strong safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to ensure our employees can leave their job and return home safely, every day. This commitment and focus have enabled us to restart our business operations without sacrificing the safety of our employees and customers. In addition to our COVID-19 protections, which are discussed within the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business section further above, we have partnered with local communities in some of our North American manufacturing workshops to provide free transportation to and from work and offer daily low-cost meals. In coordination with national healthcare systems for our manufacturing facilities outside of the United States, we provide on-site medical clinics staffed by a doctor and a team of experienced nurses, who also provide a pharmacy to prescribe over-the-counter medications. In addition to offering onsite medical care, we partner with local physicians to provide medical care for every associate’s family members.
Community Giving
 
Throughout our history, philanthropy has been a core value to Ethan Allen. We strive to develop exceptional programs based on partnerships where employees feel a sense of connection and pride in their communities and our mission is to enhance the quality of life in the communities in which we work and live. Our philanthropic efforts include donations to local universities, arts organizations and more, while also supporting education initiatives and disaster relief for our employees. Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ethan Allen helped produce more than 200,000 units of personal protective equipment. Our skilled craftspeople also turned  antimicrobial fabrics into washable medical-grade masks, as well as disposable fabric gowns. We further helped distribute masks to local schools, and both masks and gowns were given to nearby hospitals and other locations where essential workers needed them. In addition, when devastating hurricanes impacted our Honduras manufacturing operation during fiscal 2021, we acted quickly and through a strong coordinated effort with the local authorities, we worked to help our employees find safety, if needed. For those associates who lost personal belongings, we provided them necessary food, clothing, bedding and medications.
Compensation and Other Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate team members to achieve strong results. We benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled labor throughout our enterprise. Certain of the benefits we offer include access to healthcare plans, financial and physical wellness programs, paid time off, parental leave and retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan with Company matching contributions.
Customer Service Offerings
 
We offer numerous customer service programs, each of which has been developed and introduced to customers in an effort to make their shopping experience easier and more enjoyable.
Gift Card. This program allows customers to purchase and redeem gift cards through our website or at any participating retail design center, which can be used for any of our products or services.
Ethan Allen Consumer Credit. The Ethan Allen Platinum Card consumer credit program offers customers a menu of custom financing options. Financing offered through this program is administered by a third-party financial institution and is granted to our customers on a non-recourse basis to the Company. Customers may apply for an Ethan Allen Platinum card at any participating design center or online at ethanallen.com.

Competition
 
The home furnishings industry is a highly fragmented and competitive business. There has been growth in the e‑commerce channel both from internet only retailers and those with a brick-and-mortar presence. We believe the home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, personal service, prompt delivery, product availability and price. We compete with numerous individual retail home furnishing stores as well as national and regional chains. We further believe that we are uniquely positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors and that, more specifically under our vertical integration structure, our complimentary interior design service, direct manufacturing, white glove delivery service, product presentations, and website create a competitive advantage, further supporting our mission of providing customers with a complete home decorating and design solution. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves further with the quality of our interior design service through our intensive training and the caliber of our interior design professionals. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our retail network by (i) expanding the Company-operated retail business through the repositioning and opening of new design centers, (ii) obtaining new and retaining independent retailers, encouraging such retailers to expand their business through the opening or relocation of new design centers with the objective of increasing the volume of their sales, (iii) further expanding our sales network through our independent design associates and realtor referral programs, and (iv) further expanding our e-commerce.
Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility 
 
We continue to be focused on environmental and social responsibility while incorporating uniform social, environmental, health and safety programs into our global manufacturing standards.
 
Our environmental (green) initiatives include, but are not limited to the use of responsibly harvested Appalachian woods, and water-based finishes and measuring our carbon footprint, greenhouse gases and recycled materials from our operations. We have eliminated the use of heavy metals and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in all packaging. Our mattresses and custom upholstery use foam made without harmful chemicals and substances. We have implemented the Enhancing Furniture’s Environmental Culture (“EFEC”) environmental management system sponsored by the American Home Furnishing Alliance (“AHFA”) at all our domestic manufacturing, distribution and home delivery center facilities, and have expanded these efforts to our retail design centers, which have now been registered in EFEC. Our Mexico and Honduras facilities are also registered under the AHFA's EFEC program. Our United States manufacturing, distribution and home delivery centers have also achieved Sustainable by Design (“SBD”) registration status under the EFEC program. SBD provides a framework for home furnishings companies to create and maintain a corporate culture of conservation and environmental stewardship by integrating socio-economic policies and sustainable business practices into their manufacturing operations and sourcing strategies.
 
Our manufacturing operations involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws and, from time to time, we may be involved in a small number of remediation actions and site investigations concerning these substances. Based on a review of all currently known facts and our experience with previous environmental matters, we currently do not believe it is probable that we will have any additional loss for environmental matters that would be material to our consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company requires its sourcing facilities that manufacture Ethan Allen branded products to implement a labor compliance program and meet or exceed the standards established for preventing child labor, involuntary labor, coercion and harassment, discrimination, and restrictions to freedom of association. These facilities are also required to provide a safe and healthy environment in all workspaces, compliance with all local wage and hour laws and regulations, compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and are required to authorize Ethan Allen or its designated agents (including third-party auditing companies) to engage in monitoring activities to confirm compliance. We work to ensure our products are safe in our customers’ homes through responsible use of chemicals and manufacturing substances.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks, service marks and copyrights for the Ethan Allen name, logos and designs in a broad range of classes for both products and services in the United States and in many foreign countries. In addition, we have registered, or have applications pending for certain of our slogans utilized in connection with promoting brand awareness, retail sales and other services and certain collection names. In addition, we have registered and maintain the internet domain name of ethanallen.com. We view such trademarks, logos, service marks and domain names as valuable assets and have an ongoing program to diligently monitor and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use.
