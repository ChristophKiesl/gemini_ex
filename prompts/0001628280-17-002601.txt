ITEM 1. BUSINESS

We are a life science company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a proprietary molecular genetic detection technology for use in pharmaceutical development, clinical research and medical testing across a variety of clinical disciplines, including oncology and virology.  Our primary focus is utilizing our core technology in measuring circulating tumor DNA (“ctDNA”) in urine and blood, also called a liquid biopsy, with our proprietary platforms and research use only kits and reagents. We look to commercialize our technology by providing testing services from our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”)/College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) accredited laboratory in San Diego, California, as well as by distributing research use only kits and systems to clinical research laboratories, leading cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies. Other applications for our technologies and intellectual property include infectious disease, transplant medicine and prenatal genetics.

The genetic materials that result when cells in the body die and release their DNA into the bloodstream, are collectively referred to as “cell-free nucleic acids.” The circulating fragments of genetic material can be detected and measured in urine, filtered through the kidney, and blood.  Cell-free nucleic acids can be used as genetic markers of disease and the ability to use urine or blood as liquid biopsy sample types allows for simple, noninvasive, or minimally invasive, sample collection methods. We are leveraging our proprietary Precision Cancer Monitoring (“PCM”) technology to extract and enrich the DNA in urine and blood to enable ourselves, through our CLIA-certified/CAP-accredited laboratory, and others, through the distribution of research use kits and systems, to detect and monitor ctDNA in urine and blood. We believe our PCM technology can allow for improved detection and quantitation of oncogene mutations from tumors to help improve disease and cancer patient management.  

Our branded Trovera™ liquid biopsy tests are clinical tests performed by our San Diego CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory for use by physicians, third party clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies. The Trovera™ line of tests include Trovera™ EGFR, KRAS and BRAF and are performed using both urine and blood patient samples. We believe all of our Trovera™ tests provide important clinical information beyond the current testing standard of care. At the end of 2016, we analytically validated a multigene panel consisting of 7 oncogenes, including EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, HER2, KIT, with over 200 mutation, insertion and deletion variants. This panel is being clinically validated for use in our San Diego based CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory and will focus on solid tumor cancers such as lung, colorectal, pancreas, and melanoma. We intend to offer this panel as a testing service for pharmaceutical companies, third party reference laboratories and physicians. We also plan to offer research use only (“RUO”) kits, based on these same markers for broad distribution for clinical research purposes.  
We have developed significant intellectual property around cell-free nucleic acids in urine, and the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids from urine, as well as novel assay designs, particularly our proprietary non-naturally occurring primers.  Through this proprietary technology, we believe that we are at the forefront of a shift in the way diagnostic medicine is practiced, using simple, noninvasive or minimally invasive sampling and analysis of nucleic acids. We believe this will ultimately lead to more effective treatment monitoring, better management of serious illnesses such as cancer, and the ability to detect the success of cancer treatment, the recurrence of cancer, or the progression of cancer, earlier.  As of December 31, 2016, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of over 120 issued patents and over 60 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad.  Our patent estate includes the detection of cell-free nucleic acids from urine and blood, as well as their application in specific disease areas, including oncology, infectious disease, transplantation, and prenatal genetics.

We believe that our proprietary technology platform is uniquely positioned to address a high unmet clinical need in the field of oncology.  Our technology is designed to offer better cancer monitoring by tracking and quantifying levels of ctDNA from either urine or blood samples, and is intended to provide important clinical information often missed with traditional diagnostic tools, including tissue biopsy.  Using urine as a sample, our cancer monitoring technology enables frequent, noninvasive detection and monitoring of oncogene mutation status, response to therapy, disease progression and disease recurrence. We signed a long-term supply and distribution agreement with Boreal Genomics, Inc. (“Boreal”) in the fourth quarter of 2016, to capitalize on the synergies with Boreal’s mutation enrichment system and our expanding product portfolio of ctDNA markers in urine and blood. We intend to address an unmet need in the liquid biopsy testing market by providing a simple, routine and low-cost urine and blood ctDNA assays for next-generation sequencing (“NGS”) platforms run by laboratories of research institutions, cancer centers, and service facilities around the world.  
We believe our technology expertise and extensive patent portfolio around cell-free DNA in urine and blood gives us a competitive advantage to leverage an emerging trend of monitoring cancer using ctDNA as a marker of disease status.  Our proprietary sample preparation process includes novel technology for the collection and DNA preservation (“Next™Collect”), 
3

DNA extraction and isolation (“Next™Extract”) of ctDNA from a urine sample, proprietary, non-naturally occurring primers to enrich the sample for mutant alleles, and the ability to detect nucleic acids of interest using NGS. We believe that our quantitative ctDNA detection and monitoring platforms offer industry-leading sensitivity, allowing single-copy detection, a significant advantage over competitive methods.

Recent scientific and clinical publications support the clinically utility of detecting and monitoring cancer with liquid biopsy technologies, which we believe will result in a paradigm shift in the way cancer is diagnosed and treated.  Researchers and clinicians are now focused on specific oncogene mutations and alterations that are causal for specific cancers at the molecular level, and, as a result, the pharmaceutical research community has increased developed targeted therapies.  As such, there is a need for oncologists to have an ability to detect and track the mutational status of their patients and to assess a given patient’s therapeutic response.  We believe that current monitoring tools such as imaging procedures, tissue biopsy and circulating tumor cell testing are insufficient to meet the challenge of monitoring oncogene mutations.  Imaging provides an indication of tumor size that is an important diagnostic tool, but provides little practical information to oncologists regarding mutational status and appropriate treatment options, especially for molecular targeted therapies.  Tissue biopsy usually involves a surgical procedure and, in many cases, is not repeatable as there are limitations related to access for serial biopsies.  In some cases, biopsies may not be available, or may be insufficient for molecular diagnostics, significantly increasing the need to determine mutational status using an alternative method.  In addition, tumor heterogeneity is a further confounding factor, as the surgeon may not obtain the proper tissue from the tumor sample.  In the case of circulating tumor cells, which are typically measured using blood tests, sensitivity is traditionally low, and such tests can be technically difficult and expensive to conduct.
Targeted therapies are typically very expensive, can have significant side effects, and efficacy can vary by patient.  In order to measure effectiveness, repeated monitoring is needed and serial biopsies can be difficult to obtain.  If resistance develops, fast and accurate detection of emerging or changing oncogene mutation status is critical.  Our technology platforms provide a novel solution for identifying ctDNA in urine and blood, plentiful sample sources, and we are continuing to build a growing body of evidence supporting the clinical utility of our technology to monitor cancer using ctDNA.

Our goal is to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients using our proprietary technology to detect and quantitatively monitor ctDNA using a urine or blood sample.

Developing a Market for Molecular Diagnostic Tests based on Liquid Biopsies using Circulating Tumor DNA

We intend to develop and expand our cell-free nucleic acid molecular diagnostic technology into a pipeline of potentially groundbreaking commercial molecular detection and monitoring products.  Our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory in San Diego, California has enabled us to commercialize our testing services and launch our technology platform and associated innovative molecular monitoring tests.  Urine- and blood based molecular diagnostics can provide relevant information across multiple therapeutic and clinical areas, and may lead to improvements in patient management.
  Our strategy and focus is to further transform oncology and patient care by providing precision medicine solutions. As the only company with technology in both urine and blood, and demonstrating industry-leading sensitivity, we are developing highly sensitive, clinically actionable multigene panels and plan to initiate global distribution of RUO kits and systems in 2017. We will provide these RUO kits and systems to academic institutions, cancer centers and laboratories throughout the world to be used for clinical research purposes. Our initial RUO proprietary kits will include a urine collection and DNA preservation cup (“Next™Collect”), a ctDNA extraction and isolation (“Next™Extract”) kit and a mutation enrichment kit (“ERTHOS™ Select”), along with the ERTHOS™ (“electrophoretic repetitive transient hybridization on substrate”) system. Additionally, we are entering into agreements with Distributors outside of the U.S. to offer our CLIA-developed Trovera™ tests to customers in their respective regions of the world. Our goal is to offer our ERTHOS™ kit and systems to our Distribution partners for dissemination to their customers.

In order to facilitate early availability and use of our products and technologies, in February 2012, we acquired the CLIA laboratory assets of MultiGEN Diagnostics, Inc. (“MultiGEN”), which included CLIA approval and licensing documentation, laboratory procedures, customer lists and marketing materials.  A CLIA lab is a clinical reference laboratory that can perform high complexity diagnostic assays (e.g., those requiring polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) amplification).  Through this CLIA laboratory, we are able to offer laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) in compliance with CLIA guidelines.

Targeting cell-free nucleic acid markers allows for the development of genetic tests that use noninvasive and easy-to-obtain urine samples, as well as blood samples, rather than other more traditional and more invasive, expensive and/or often unreliable methods, such as radiographic imaging and tissue biopsy.  These methods include medical imaging, blood testing, and tissue biopsies.  We are exploring a broad range of clinical utilities where cell-free nucleic acid technology holds the potential to replace more complex, less robust existing technologies.  We are developing more effective, noninvasive 
4

diagnostics, which align with the current industry shift toward highly personalized medicine.  Urine- and blood based cell-free nucleic acid molecular tests can make it easier to address important health problems and may lead to significant advancements in patient care.
Our patented technology uses both urine and blood collection, which can be applied to a broad range of testing, including tumor mutation detection and monitoring, infectious disease monitoring, transplantation monitoring and prenatal genetic diagnostics.  We believe that our urine-based technology, in particular, is ideally suited to be used in developing molecular diagnostic assays that will allow physicians to provide simple, noninvasive, and convenient screening and monitoring tests for their patients by identifying specific biomarkers involved in a disease process.  Our novel urine- and blood based assays can facilitate improved testing compliance, resulting in a more effective use of targeted therapies, earlier detection of disease and disease progression or recurrence, and improvements in both patient outcomes and cost of care.

The material terms of certain of our clinical collaboration, research and development, and technology license agreements that we have entered into are as follows:
In November 2016, we entered into a long-term Supply and Distribution Agreement with Boreal, merging our respective technologies to co-develop urine and blood ctDNA assay kits and systems. Through this partnership, the companies intend to address an unmet need in the liquid biopsy testing market by providing an assay platform to enable simple, routine, low-cost sample processing that could be run by NGS laboratories of research institutions, cancer centers, and service facilities around the world. Trovagene and Boreal have each contributed proprietary technology and methods to enhance ctDNA detection capabilities from urine and blood to develop a series of cancer specific multigene panels planned for launch in 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, we may pay Boreal two milestone payments totaling $1.0 million for licensing and distribution rights.  As of December 31, 2016, we incurred $500,000 related to this agreement.
In July 2016, we entered into a broad collaboration agreement with the University of Southern California (“USC”) Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. This collaboration will seek to establish a standardized framework for the use of Trovera™ urine liquid biopsy testing at USC as well as to define practical considerations and best practices for liquid biopsy testing from urine. The collaboration will also explore the development of clinical treatment algorithms through investigational studies to solidify how and when liquid biopsy testing can be employed.
In July 2016, we entered into a multi-phased collaborative research program with the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center utilizing the Trovera™ KRAS ctDNA liquid biopsy test. As part of this research collaboration, our ctDNA urine and blood tests will be utilized as noninvasive diagnostic tools to enable early detection and rapid monitoring of patient response to therapy. This will allow the investigators to quickly test multiple therapies to determine which one will be most effective in treating an individual patient’s tumor. 
In September 2015, we established Trovagene Srl, also known as the Trovagene Research Institute (“TRI”), a European subsidiary focused on expanding the capabilities and adoption of the PCM platform. Concurrent with the establishment of TRI, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Department of Oncology at the University of Torino, a leading research center in southern Europe. The collaboration seeks to leverage the superior benefits of urine as a specimen for the detection and monitoring of oncogenic mutations, enhance the multi-gene assay methods and analyses we develop, and explore novel applications in liquid biopsy such as methylation biomarkers.
We have had a history of clinical collaborations and research with leading academic and clinical research oncology institutions around the world. These collaborations allowed access for testing matched patient specimens to oncology tumor profiles, among other applications. Our collaborations have included institutions such as Catholic Health Initiatives Center for Translational Research, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. 

In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Columbia University pursuant to which they granted to us a license under their patent rights to hairy cell leukemia biomarkers.  The license agreement will continue in effect until May 10, 2021, which is the date of the last to expire of the licensed patent rights covering the license product.  The license agreement may also be terminated upon a material breach by Columbia University or by us if we determine that it is not commercially or scientifically appropriate to further develop the license product rights. 
In October 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Gianluca Gaidano, Robert Foa and Davide Rossi pursuant to which they granted to us a license under their patent rights to a specific gene mutation with respect to chronic lymphoblastic leukemia.  We have an option to purchase the licensed patent rights in the event the licensor decides to sell such licensed patent rights.  The license agreement will continue in effect until September 29, 2031, which is the date of the last to 
5

expire of the licensed patent rights covering the license product.  The license agreement may also be terminated upon a material breach by any party or by us if it is determined that it is not commercially or scientifically appropriate to further develop the license product rights.
In May 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Drs. Falini and Mecucci, pursuant to which they granted to us an exclusive license under their exclusive rights for the genetic marker for AML with the intention to utilize these rights for the development of new diagnostic tools.  In August 2010, we signed an amendment no.1 to the license agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to pay modified royalties to Drs. Brunangelo Falini and Cristina Mecucci.  During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded royalty expenses of approximately $21,000, $22,000 and $23,000, respectively.
We are a party to various sublicense agreements under which we sublicense certain of our technologies to other academic institutions and companies in exchange for royalty and license fees. Royalty and license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of net revenues, subject to certain minimums, with rates that vary by agreements. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net royalty and license fee revenues of approximately $258,000, $275,000 and $270,000, respectively.

The Basis for Our Urine-based Molecular Diagnostic Technology

Cell-free nucleic acids have been found in a variety of human bodily fluids, with the nucleic acids isolated from urine having been extensively characterized.  Cell-free nucleic acids in urine have been proven to contain mutated DNA and other markers of disease, including microRNA.  In contrast to other bodily fluids (e.g., blood plasma), urine allows for truly noninvasive collection of the sample, provides a larger sample size, and allows for frequent collection.  Importantly, urine enables the collection of nucleic acid material from the systemic circulation over a period of time, and those DNA and RNA fragments remain stable in urine.  These factors, combined with recently developed technologies to sequence, count, and track nucleic acids with low relative abundance, make the development of our noninvasive diagnostics commercially practical and scalable.

In the human body, about 1011 - 1012 cells die each day primarily as a consequence of natural physiological processes for tissue and organ maintenance, but also as a result of disease.  Together, these dead and dying cells contain more than one gram of DNA, which is mostly degraded into short fragments by specific enzymes.  A small proportion of these cell-free nucleic acids escapes complete degradation and appears in the bloodstream.  Our scientists were the first to discover that circulating cell-free nucleic acids cross the kidney barrier and can be found in the urine as cell-free DNA.  This simple yet remarkable discovery that genetic information from various cells throughout the body is present in urine enabled the development of new, noninvasive techniques for molecular diagnostics and genetic testing.

To unlock the full potential of cell-free nucleic acids, we have developed a proprietary method for the isolation of the short fragmented ctDNA that pass through the kidneys, and proprietary “ultra-short” amplicon assays necessary for the efficient 
6

detection of cell-free nucleic acids, which can be analyzed at our San Diego-based CLIA laboratory. Because of the small size of cell-free nucleic acids in urine, having an isolation method that efficiently captures short nucleic acids is critical.  We have multiple methods (patents and pending patents) for the isolation of nucleic acids from bodily fluids, including urine.  Many nucleic isolation methods are not properly suited for the isolation of cell-free nucleic acids in urine.  For example, many DNA isolation kits only capture DNA greater than 200 base-pairs (“bp”) in length, with a few claiming 100 bp or longer.  When compared to leading kits for the isolation of DNA from bodily fluids, we have observed, by conducting internal studies, that our method is three to twenty times more efficient in isolating short targets of DNA (e.g., 50 bp) target.  In addition to our cell-free nucleic acid isolation method, we have developed our technology for detecting ultra-short amplicons (patents pending).  By combining our proprietary nucleic acid isolation method with our ultra-short amplicon assays, we are able to detect systemically derived mutations in urine.  We believe that these methods are also applicable to other small or fragmented nucleic acids, including cell-free DNA from blood and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples.

We are addressing a gap between single-gene PCR assays that can be limited by sample availability and expensive, broad, multigene panels hindered by low clinical sensitivity for mutation detection. In 2017, we plan to introduce our first pan-cancer multigene panel and to offer key institutions and cancer centers the opportunity to bring our proprietary technology and RUO kits in-house for mutation testing and analysis.
Determining DNA and RNA signatures using urine as a “systemic biopsy” may provide a more powerful and effective tool for following and uncovering both pre-clinical and clinical changes, which may include:


• | monitoring cancer patients to determine therapeutic response or non-response and disease recurrence;


• | determining mutational status when tissue biopsy is unavailable or not advisable;


• | monitoring for minimal residual disease (“MRD”) after surgical resection of a malignant tumor, following organ transplant status to watch for rejection;


• | noninvasively securing samples for the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases; and


• | screening and testing expectant mothers, whose fetuses may be at risk for certain genetic abnormalities.


Currently, these clinical needs are addressed by the use of invasive bone marrow tests, tissue biopsies, and amniocentesis, as well as costly CT, MRI, and PET scans.

This technology we developed in urine can be applied to detection and monitoring in a broad spectrum of diseases and also to a broad spectrum of sample types (blood, CSF, tissue, etc.).
Characteristics of Urine-based Cell-free Nucleic Acid Testing


• | The kidney acts as a filter, passing cell-free nucleic acids from complex, multicellular, multicomponent blood into urine, a less complex aqueous environment.


• | The collection procedure is noninvasive and does not require the involvement of trained medical staff.


• | Urine as a sample type supports repeated testing when required and poses no discomfort for the patient.


• | Cell-free nucleic acids in urine are stable at room temperature for extended periods of time with the addition of a simple preservative. Many other traditional samples are not. 


• | Sample processing and tests can often be easily automated.


• | Isolation of cell-free markers from large sample volumes increases sensitivity of the tests. This cannot be done as easily or reliably using tissue specimens, which have inherent limitations. 


• | Blood or sputum samples for detection of infectious diseases may not be easily obtained from certain patients, including small children and the elderly. Urine specimens typically present minimal acquisition concerns. 


• | Blood and other bodily fluids can be highly infectious by nature, urine is not.

• | Blood and other bodily fluids are legally considered biohazardous, urine is not.

Clinical Applications

We believe that our urine- and blood based cell-free molecular diagnostic tests will make it easier to address important health problems worldwide and will lead to significant advances in personalized medicine for improved patient care.  We intend to continue amassing clinical evidence for our cancer monitoring tests in three distinct and potentially overlapping stages.  Stage 1 studies are qualitative in nature and are designed to determine the mutational status of actionable biomarkers in urine and blood especially when tissue biopsy is not an option or is inadvisable.  These studies demonstrate concordance (agreement) of the oncogene mutation status between a urine sample, blood sample and a tumor tissue sample.  These studies are considered to have diagnostic value and are designed to prove that urine- and blood based molecular test results closely match tissue biopsy.  The clinical utility of such studies validates that mutational status of actionable biomarkers can be determined in urine or blood when a tissue biopsy is not an option or is not feasible.  Stage 2 studies are quantitative in nature and are designed to assess patient mutational status in urine or blood, longitudinally (over time), as an indicator of responsiveness to therapy and disease status of the patient.  Stage 3 studies are conducted with the goal to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and eventually could lead to changing medical guidelines and establishment of a new clinical standard of care for managing certain cancers.  Demonstrated clinical utility includes quantitatively assessing patient mutational status in urine or blood, longitudinally, for mutational status as well as early detection of resistance to therapy as a decision tool for therapy selection.  Generating clinical data with our technology that supports better patient outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources is a key component of Stage 3.

We believe that there are several specific applications of our PCM platform technology with regard to helping oncologists monitor a patient’s mutational status, thereby optimizing the treatment approach and improving outcomes. Our technology can be used to determine a patient’s mutational status for the first time when a tissue biopsy is not feasible, or it can be used to monitor changes in mutational load over time to provide information that can be useful to inform treatment decisions. Should a patient have their tumor removed surgically, our technology can be used to broadly search for minimal residual disease, which can confirm a successful procedure or enable early detection of recurrent disease for improved patient management. Treatment-emergent mutations can also be a major problem and may be drivers of resistance to first-line therapy. Examples of this include the emergent mutation EGFR T790M in lung cancer or KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer. Because our platform can use a noninvasive, easy to obtain sample from the patient, the ability to monitor more accurately and more often, with fewer barriers to doing so, can provide us with key competitive advantages in the marketplace, particularly with regard to monitoring for treatment-emergent mutations.
Oncology

Urine or blood offer an alternative to tissue biopsy and radiographic imaging.  By tracking mutations, we can inform medical practice.  Our initial studies focused on the BRAF mutation because of its link to discreet cancers and associated treatments, as well as the KRAS mutation because of its broad applicability in many cancers.  Additionally, initial studies focused on EGFR and non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), and specifically the emergence of the resistance mutation T790M, have played a key role in identifying patients who are progressing on 1st or 2nd generation targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) therapy, and who may benefit from a 3rd generation TKI. We are now developing National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline driven, clinically actionable multiGENE pan-cancer and resistance panels for a variety of mutations seen in many common cancer types. 

During 2015-2016, we had over 20 ongoing clinical studies with leading cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative clinical utility of our tests.  Clinical study sites include MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, USC Norris Cancer Center, the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, as well as other top cancer centers, US Oncology, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, and pharmaceutical collaborators.
In particular, in October 2016, we were selected by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, as the liquid biopsy provider to participate in Precision Promise, the first large-scale precision medicine trial designed to transform outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. The clinical trials aim to evolve the way diagnostics are used to optimize treatment and improve patient survival. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is the leading non-profit organization committed to increasing survival for people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and is making an initial investment of $35 million in the Precision Promise program to accelerate the clinical trial process to bring promising therapies to patients faster. As a founding member of the initial Precision Promise Industry Working Group, we will contribute to sub-study design and future study objectives. We are engaged with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network to enter into an agreement for the use of our Trovera™ 
8

KRAS liquid biopsy test as a dynamic tool throughout the course of patient treatment with experimental therapies, conducted through the Precision Promise program.

Clinical proof of concept for EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutation assays

The rociletinib (a 3rd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor) TIGER-X phase 1/2 study, a collaboration with several leading cancer centers and Clovis Oncology (pharmaceutical company), focused on evaluating the clinical utility of a highly sensitive next-generation sequencing platform for detecting the EGFR T790M resistance mutation in urine and blood from patients with advanced NSCLC. While lung cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies, progress has been made in the advancement of therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. In particular, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (“EGFR-TKIs”), have demonstrated clinical response rates as high as 80% in patients with NSCLC. However; after 6 to 12 months, most tumors develop acquired resistance to these targeted therapies, and the secondary mutation T790M occurs in approximately 60% of patients showing progression on a 1st or 2nd generation TKI. Results from this study were presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) meeting and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (“IASLC”) World Conference on Lung Cancer in 2016. The data demonstrates that mutation enrichment NGS testing of urine and plasma combined identified more T790M positive cases (95%) compared to tissue alone (83%) and cases missed by tissue are likely due to tumor heterogeneity and/or inadequate tissue biopsy. Each sample type identified unique T790M positive patients providing complementary information and detection sensitivity. Sensitivity of T790M detection in urine was not influenced by intra- vs extra-thoracic disease, with a combination of urine and plasma testing identifying the most T790M positive patients irrespective of disease status (intrathoracic = 91%, extrathoracic = 96%). Combined analysis of urine and plasma should be considered before tissue testing in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC, including patients without extra-thoracic metastases. In July 2016, publication of the preliminary study results, entitled “A Highly Sensitive and Quantitative Test Platform for Detection of NSCLC EGFR Mutations in Urine and Plasma,” demonstrating the clinical and analytical validity of the Trovera™ urine- and blood based liquid biopsy tests to assess EGFR T790M mutational status, was published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology.
The MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical study focused on detecting and monitoring BRAF and KRAS tumor mutations in ctDNA from urine and blood in metastatic cancer patients.  BRAF mutations are common in colorectal, melanoma, thyroid, and other cancers.  Within the U.S., it is estimated that nearly 730,000 patients have tumors with BRAF mutations.  Several targeted therapies are either on the market or in development for BRAF-mutation positive cancers.  

Results from the MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical study were presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference in October 2013.  During the study, urine samples from metastatic cancer patients known to have BRAF V600E, KRAS G12D or KRAS G12V mutations were assessed.  Our researchers analyzed the urine samples using our urine-based cell-free molecular diagnostic assays.  Results demonstrated high concordance between urine and tissue mutational status.  In addition, preliminary results indicate that ctDNA BRAF V600E mutation monitoring in urine correlates with clinical response to therapy.  The clinical study demonstrated that BRAF V600E mutations were detected in urine irrespective of the cancer type, and a multitude of different cancer types, including brain cancer (“glioblastoma”), were included in the initial study results.  The BRAF V600E assay demonstrated 95% concordance vs. tissue biopsy (both detected and borderline), and also demonstrated that urinary DNA can be used to detect DNA fragments from circulation that harbor tumor mutations.  The following cancers were detected during the study: NSCLC, papillary thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, ovarian cancer, and appendiceal cancer.  In addition, preliminary results indicate that ctDNA BRAF V600E mutation monitoring in urine longitudinally correlates with clinical response to therapy.

The study also evaluated the feasibility of using massively parallel deep sequencing (i.e., NGS) to identify DNA mutations in the urine and blood of metastatic cancer patients harboring known KRAS mutations.  Leveraging proprietary enrichment methods, our researchers were able to detect mutant ctDNA in the urine of cancer patients with verified KRAS mutations. Data from this study was presented at the 2017 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium and published in Clinical Cancer Research (Fujii, et al, 2017). In a cohort of 71 patients with advanced cancers, the KRAS assay had good concordance with tissue testing and changes in urine ctDNA were associated with time to treatment failure

CLIA validated EGFR mutation assays
In the first quarter of 2015, our urine-based tests for the activating mutations, EGFR L858R and EGFR Exon 19 Deletions, as well as the resistance mutation, EGFR T790M, became available to clinicians through our CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory.  These assays detect and monitor three critical mutations that are believed to drive the progression of NSCLC. The robustness of our ultra-sensitive assays has been demonstrated for the detection of these three EGFR mutations from cell-free DNA in urine.  
9

In November 2015, the first targeted treatment for EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, Tagrisso (osimertinib), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Additional drug candidates are in advanced clinical development for this indication. We believe that our noninvasive assays for the detection and monitoring of both activating and resistance EGFR mutations have potential to play an important role in the treatment of NSCLC.
An initial clinical study conducted at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center focused on the determination and monitoring of EGFR T790 resistance mutations in lung cancer patients. With new targeted therapies for EGFR T790M mutation-positive lung cancer on the market or in late-stage clinical development, detection of this resistance mutation has a direct impact on treatment selection for patients who are progressing on first-line targeted therapy.  The primary purpose of this collaborative study was to determine whether EGFR T790M mutations can be evaluated in urine to monitor treatment response in patients that are found to be positive for the mutation. We have several ongoing programs to evaluate the detection and monitoring of EGFR mutational status in lung cancer patients.  A focus of these studies is the emergence of the resistant mutation EGFR T790M in these patients, which can be important for informing treatment decisions. Our collaborators for evaluating our technology in NSCLC include Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Clovis Oncology, and Genomac Research Institute, among others.
 In April 2015, we presented clinical results at the European Lung Cancer Conference demonstrating that our urine-based PCM platform outperformed tissue biopsy for the detection and monitoring of EGFR T790M mutations in metastatic lung cancer patients. In an interim analysis of 34 patients from an ongoing clinical study, our PCM platform detected the EGFR T790M mutation in all patients who were positive for the mutation in tissue biopsy. Our urine-based assay identified additional patients as EGFR T790M-positive, including those who had clinical suspicion of EGFR T790M-progressive disease, but were either negative by tissue biopsy or had not yet undergone tissue biopsy for confirmation. Based on the study results, our PCM platform detected EGFR T790M resistance mutations months earlier than radiologic detection of progression in patients. Early pharmacodynamic events occurring within hours or days of anti-EGFR drug treatment were evaluated in the study by implementing daily monitoring of urinary ctDNA. Initial results demonstrated that immediate changes in EGFR mutational load using a urine specimen may identify patients who respond to anti-EGFR therapy much earlier than follow-up CT-scans.
In June 2015, we announced the presentation of clinical study results at ASCO. The study was designed to determine the concordance between tissue and urine in patients with metastatic NSCLC with confirmed or suspected T790M resistance mutation. Additionally, the study tested the hypothesis that T790M could be detected in advance of radiographic scan showing disease progression and that early dynamics of T790M mutational load in ctDNA within the first week may provide insight into tumor biology and predict radiographic response to therapy with 2nd line TKI therapy. Concordance to urine: EGFR T790M mutation was detected in 24 of 35 (69%) patients receiving anti-EGFR treatment. Urine T790M detected in 14 out of 14 tissue-positive patients (100% sensitivity). Early acquisition of EGFR T790M: T790M mutation was detected as early as 3 months prior to radiological progression. Pharmacodynamics of early response seen in urine: Spikes in ctDNA after daily collection may correlate with early tumor lysis. 
In November 2015, we announced the presentation of data at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Meeting, assessing EGFR mutation detection in matched urine, plasma and tumor tissue in NSCLC patients treated with an investigational 3rd generation TKI. Approximately 60% of patients who receive an EGFR-TKI develop the acquired resistance mutation T790M. Acquisition of suitable tumor tissue is a challenge for a considerable fraction of advanced NSCLC patients who require EGFR testing. We examined the detection of EGFR T790M mutation in ctDNA from urine, assessed urine sample requirements, and compared the results with contemporaneously matched tumor tissue and plasma in TIGER-X, a phase 1/2 clinical study of rociletinib in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC and mutant EGFR. The analysis of ctDNA from urine identified a similar proportion of T790M positive patients as tissue- or plasma based testing, with the highest positive percent agreement (“PPA”) among patients with approximately half of a normal void (90-100 mL, PPA=93%). Urine and tissue tests complement one another; each test identifies cases missed by the other. Discordant samples between urine and tissue that were not identified by the tumor test may be explained by tumor heterogeneity and/or inadequate biopsy. EGFR mutation detection from urine should be considered a viable approach, particularly when tumor tissue is not available. Monitoring urine ctDNA T790M mutation levels longitudinally is feasible and is being further explored as a means to inform choice of therapy.
In June 2016, we announced the presentation of data from a large study demonstrating the use of urine testing for the detection of EGFR T790M mutations at ASCO. In an oral presentation entitled, “EGFR Genotyping of Matched Urine, Plasma, and Tumor Tissue in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated with an EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor,” we presented data that demonstrated the clinical response to rociletinib was comparable irrespective of whether T790M status was identified by urine, plasma or tissue biopsy. 
In December 2016, we announced the presentation of data from a large study entitled “A Highly Sensitive Next Generation Sequencing Platform for Detection of NSCLC EGFR T790M Detection in Urine and Plasma,” at the IASLC World 
10

Conference on Lung Cancer. In this study we demonstrated mutation enrichment NGS testing by urine and plasma by Trovera™ testing in combination identified 94.8% of T790M positive cases. Combination of urine and plasma may be considered before tissue testing in EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC, including patients without extrathoracic metastases
In December 2016, we announced the presentation of an outcomes and total cost of care analysis using urine ctDNA T790M mutation testing in patients with NSCLC, at the IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer. The analysis showed that a Urine Testing Strategy (“UTS”) is expected to reduce biopsies and associated risk of complications by 55.6% compared with a Tissue Testing Strategy (“TTS”). Cost savings exceeding $1,200 are anticipated and may be 2-to 3-fold greater (>$2,700 per test ordered). UTS increases the likelihood of detecting T790M and treating appropriately. Savings significantly depend on factors including the type of treatment for T790M-negative disease. The actual cost of care is likely higher, as costs vary depending on the setting, thus savings from avoided biopsies and their complications are likely larger than what is reported in the base case. Novel technologies may have detection rates approaching 100%. As shown in this analysis, the UTS care pathway with a detection rate of about 80% is sufficient to realize considerable costs relative to TTS. The rational and efficient use of resources will necessarily put great emphasis on assigning a unit cost to the test in relation to its clinical and economic value. UTS is a dominant care pathway relative to TTS. It saves costs and improves the patient experience.
In December 2016, we announced the presentation of a case series of NSCLC patients and the longitudinal monitoring of ctDNA EGFR mutation burden from urine and the correlation with patient response to treatment with TKIs, at the IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer. The patient cases presented were those in which urinary mutational EGFR assessment aided in the diagnostic workup and clinical management of patients. Recent work demonstrated that EGFR ctDNA can serve as an early indicator of therapeutic response. This can provide valuable information particularly in the setting of late-stage patients treated with experimental therapies or in patients progressing on therapy. The noninvasive nature of urinary liquid biopsies allows for repeat testing to capture dynamic changes in systemic ctDNA load. The dynamic changes in ctDNA EGFR systemic load observed in this patient case series is consistent with previous findings. While further work is needed to characterize ctDNA as a formal tool for disease evaluation (e.g. RECIST), dynamic changes in ctDNA load have emerged as potentially viable biomarkers to monitor disease burden and early response to therapy. The manuscript titled, “Longitudinal Monitoring of ctDNA EGFR Mutation Burden from Urine Correlates with Patient Response to EGFR TKIs: A Case Series,” was published in the journal, Lung Cancer, in February, 2017.
CLIA validated BRAF mutation assay

In October 2013, our first urine test for cancer mutation monitoring was made available to clinicians through our CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory.  The robustness of our ultra-sensitive assay procedure has been demonstrated for the detection of the BRAF V600E mutation from ctDNA in urine.  This mutation commonly occurs in melanoma.  Of the more than 70,000 cases of melanoma diagnosed each year in the U.S., up to 70% harbor a BRAF-type mutation and of those, 80% may be positive specifically for BRAF V600E.  There are several approved targeted therapies for the treatment of BRAF-positive melanoma, making mutational status monitoring an area of clinical interest among treating physicians.

Our ctDNA BRAF test is a laboratory developed test (“LDT”), designed to detect and monitor this mutation in metastatic cancer patients with biopsy-proven V600E BRAF mutation in their tumor.  It is the first and only commercial assay within our cancer monitoring portfolio performed using a ddPCR platform.  Using urine as a noninvasive, systemic sample, the ctDNA BRAF test could help physicians monitor changes in mutation status for patients requiring therapy for cancers that have this mutation.  For patients with difficult-to-biopsy metastatic tumors, urine-based mutation testing may also provide a viable alternative to gauge mutation status as part of the initial treatment workup.

In April 2014, we announced the presentation of clinical study results at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting.  Of the 33 patients enrolled in the study, our BRAF V600E oncogene mutation assay was able to identify the mutation in 29 patients (88%) at least one time during the study, demonstrating a high level of concordance with tissue biopsy. 

Longitudinal analysis was performed in 17 patients who had more than one urine-based test during the monitoring period.  Of these patients, 13 (76%) showed a correlation between response to treatment and mutational status observed by the urine-based test.  The results were presented by Filip Janku, M.D., Ph.D., University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

In June 2014, we announced that expanded clinical study results demonstrating the utility of our PCM platform were released at the 50th Annual Meeting of the ASCO.  Data from a study in multiple cancer types were published in the 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings, a Journal of Clinical Oncology by Filip Janku, M.D., Ph.D., University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer.  In this study, longitudinal analysis of sequential urine samples demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between changes in the amount of BRAF V600E mutation load and treatment response with targeted drug therapy 
11

(p=0.002), per RECIST 1.1 criteria.  Results also demonstrated that patients with a decrease in BRAF V600E mutation load had a longer median time to treatment failure compared to those that did not (259 days versus 61 days; p=0.002).  Patients in the study had melanoma (n=7), NSCLC (n=3), colorectal cancer (n=2) and other forms of cancer (n=5).  Additionally, clinical results from a study in patients with histiocytic disease were presented by Eli Diamond, M.D., Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  In this study, our PCM technology demonstrated 93% concordance for identifying the BRAF V600E mutation and confirmed the absence of the mutation in the six patients whose biopsies tested negative.  Our assay also detected the BRAF V600E mutation in two patients for whom tissue biopsy material was inadequate to determine mutational status, and these results were subsequently confirmed with follow-up biopsies.  Our PCM platform showed 100% concordance in monitoring response to therapy in six study subjects who tested positive for the mutation and were treated with a BRAF inhibitor.  Results from this study were published in the journal, Cancer Discovery, and in clinical consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the histiocytic disease, Erdheim-Chester disease.

CLIA validated KRAS mutation assay

In March 2014, our urine based test for KRAS mutations became available to clinicians through our CLIA laboratory.  This assay detects and monitors the seven most commonly encountered mutations of the KRAS oncogene and is our first multiplexed oncogene mutation assay utilizing next-generation sequencing as a mutation detection platform.  The robustness of our ultra-sensitive assays has been demonstrated for the detection of KRAS mutations from cell-free DNA in urine.  This mutation commonly occurs in patients diagnosed with either colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, or lung cancer.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest human malignancies. According to the American Cancer Association, approximately 53,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year, and roughly 42,000 will die from the disease. Of the more than 1.1 million estimated cases of colorectal cancer in the U.S., up to 40% are estimated to harbor KRAS mutations.  In pancreatic cancer and lung cancer, approximately 90% and 15% of patient’s harbor KRAS mutations, respectively.  Because of the prevalence of this mutation in several important cancer types, detecting and quantitatively monitoring KRAS mutational status is an area of clinical interest among treating physicians.

The clinical study being conducted at the USC Norris Cancer Center is focused on mutation monitoring and the emergence of KRAS resistant mutations in colorectal cancer.  With multiple targeted therapies for colorectal cancer on the market, detection of KRAS mutations in tissue has a direct impact on the initial treatment selection for these patients.  The primary purpose of the collaborative study is to determine whether KRAS mutations can be evaluated in urine to monitor treatment response in patients that test either positive or negative for the mutation.

The U.S. Oncology clinical study will test detection and monitoring of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer patients.  In addition to the U.S. Oncology Research-affiliated community cancer care sites participating in this study, additional academic research institutions that specialize in oncology have also elected to participate.  CT scans and CA19-9 blood levels are currently the only two methods available to clinicians to monitor metastatic pancreatic cancer tumor burden and response to therapy.  However, approximately 11%-17% of patients will not display elevated CA 19-9, even with high tumor load.  For patients that test negative for CA19-9, our method to follow disease status by detecting and monitoring KRAS mutations could be distinctly beneficial.

In November 2015, we presented clinical results at the AACR-NCI-EORTC meeting highlighting our ability to detect and quantitate KRAS mutations in blood and urine samples from patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  Results showed a highly correlated response.  Of the blinded retrospective plasma cell-free DNA samples evaluated, 95% displayed the KRAS mutation concordant with tumor tissue, and for evaluable urine samples in the study, 92% displayed the KRAS mutation concordant with tumor tissue.  The majority of patients in the study underwent surgery and received neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, and serial monitoring of KRAS mutations using our assay showed a clear correlation between blood and urine samples.  An estimated analytical limit of detection of two copies per ~100,000 genome equivalents, or 0.002% was observed in the study, demonstrating very high analytical sensitivity.
In May 2016 we announced the presentation of data at the AACR Pancreatic Cancer Meeting. Data from this large clinical study in patients with pancreatic cancer demonstrates the high detection rate and ability to monitor KRAS mutations. 92.9% of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients were determined to be KRAS positive using our KRAS liquid biopsy test, which matches the published prevalence of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer (~90%). While little progress has been made in the treatment of pancreatic cancer over the past several decades, advances in the understanding of the disease's biology provide new potential opportunities for treatment. ctDNA KRAS levels can be used to distinguish between locally advanced and metastatic cancer, suggesting an improved biomarker for disease differentiation. Longitudinal monitoring of KRAS can be informative in determining responsiveness to therapy and to predict disease progression months in advance of imaging. This dataset is the largest prospective study exploring ctDNA KRAS in unresectable pancreatic cancer.

Additional mutation assays and clinical programs

We remain focused on expanding the mutation coverage of our platform to address the relevant clinically actionable driver and resistance mutations in cancers for which the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend targeted therapies, such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma. In addition to our assays for the BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR oncogenes, we are also developing more comprehensive mutation coverage for these other cancers and are adding additional oncogenes with an initial focus on lung and colorectal cancer, as well as targeting clinically validated resistance mutations for gene rearrangements such as ALK, RET, and ROS. The primary objective of our clinical development program is to demonstrate utility for noninvasive, near real-time detection and monitoring of oncogene mutations for any tumor type with our highly sensitive urine- and blood-based platform. Our clinical programs with top-tier cancer centers will continue to drive multiple opportunities for data presentations at key conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals. 
Infectious Disease
Following the completion of a pilot clinical study with a urine-based DNA test for high-risk HPV, our first HPV-HR detection assay became commercially available in March 2013.  Initial data from the pilot study showed that our assay provided superior performance to the current leading HPV assay.  Our HPV-HR Detection assay showed a sensitivity of 93.0% and specificity of 96.0% for the detection of HPV in a comparative study of 320 high-risk individuals.

In August 2014, we presented results from two clinical studies at the 29th International Papillomavirus conference for our urine-based diagnostic test for the detection of high risk strains of HPV.  Results from both pilot studies consistently demonstrated that our urine-based HPV assay had sensitivity greater than 90% for identifying women with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (“CIN”2/3).  Assay performance was comparable to traditional HPV testing with commercially available tests in patient-matched cervical samples.  In one of the studies, urine collection was examined to establish standardization of urine as a clinical specimen for high-risk HPV testing.

In February 2015, clinical results from the PREDICTORS 4 trial were presented at the European Research Organization on Genital Infection and Neoplasia (“EUROGIN”) 2015 Congress, which demonstrated high sensitivity for our noninvasive, urine-based HPV assay when determining HPV types and cervical lesions or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (“CIN”) Grade 2/3. Within the PREDICTORS 4 trial, urine and cervical samples were collected from 501 women, and data from this large patient subset demonstrated that sensitivity with our HPV assay for cervical samples was comparable to established cervical screening tests. Sensitivity of our HPV assay using cervical samples was 96.3% for CIN Grade 3+ and 94.5% for CIN Grade 2+. Sensitivity for urine samples was 91.4% for CIN Grade 3+ and 89.0% for CIN Grade 2+. Furthermore, detection of high risk HPV in urine was not different from cervical samples for all age groups of women in the study (18-29 years, 30-39 years and 40-69 years). The study authors concluded that while there is a small loss of sensitivity in urine, the greater than 90% sensitivity for CIN Grade 3+ is still better than conventional Pap cytology, which makes this assay a good candidate in our efforts to increase adoption of HPV testing, especially for women who are not currently being screened for cervical cancer.
Urine-based HPV testing may offer a significant advantage over the traditional cervical swab sample, which can present a logistic, invasive or privacy concern.  A urine-based assay also makes both female and male carrier screening feasible.

Through licensing agreements, we are pursuing commercialization of our HPV-HR Detection test, particularly in those geographies where compliance with cervical cell sampling is problematic.
Prenatal Genetics

The combination of NGS or ddPCR with our proprietary cell-free nucleic acid technology would allow for truly noninvasive prenatal screening of aneuploidies and monogenic disorders. We may pursue the development of our technology for use in prenatal genetics through licensing agreements.
Transplant

Patients who receive solid organ or bone marrow transplants are at risk of rejection, particularly during the first few months following surgery. Noninvasive monitoring of transplant status could replace repeated biopsies and blood tests, while keeping both the patient and the physician informed about potential problems.

Changing the Molecular Diagnostic Paradigm

Diagnosis and detection of severe and life-threatening diseases are among the most important outcomes of the Human Genome Project (“HGP”).  There are four requirements to realize the full benefit of the HGP in relation to advances in the war on cancer: (1) large catalogues of cancer mutations, (2) affordable sequencing of patient samples, (3) detection technologies capable of identifying and quantifying rare instances of mutations at affordable prices, and (4) abundant samples that can be collected easily and frequently in order to monitor an individual’s cancer.

The first requirement has been met through the Sanger Centre’s Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, which has documented more than 233,000 mutations in more than 20,948 genes, and by the National Institutes of Health’s (“NIH”) The Cancer Genome Atlas, which has data on more than 20 cancer types and provides a host of tools for their analysis.  The second requirement has been met through the dramatic and continuing decrease in the cost of both conventional sequencing and NGS.  NGS and ddPCR, capable of detecting rare mutations among thousands of wild type molecules at a reasonable cost, fulfill the third requirement.

Our proprietary methods provide the fourth and final requirement, the provision of an abundant systemic sample that allows the purification of cell-free nucleic acids in amounts necessary to detect rare mutations.  Furthermore, the “liquid biopsy” provided by urine can be collected frequently, is truly noninvasive, and requires no specialized personnel to collect it.

Taken together, these developments will increase the effectiveness of cancer diagnostics, improve healthcare spending efficiency and overall enable better patient care.  These developments have made the era of personalized precision medicine in cancer possible.
The Market

The global molecular diagnostics market is forecast to reach nearly $8.0 billion by 2018, a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 9.7%, from 2013-2018.  This market is segmented on the basis of application, technology, end user, product, and geography.  Based on application, the market is further segmented into infectious diseases, oncology, genetics, blood screening, microbiology, and others.  Infectious diseases secured the largest market share, whereas oncology was the fastest growing segment amongst the rest.  The driving forces of the molecular diagnostics market include the rising incidences of infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and cancer, as well as technological advancements such as assay improvements, new diagnostic tests with novel clinical utility, and portability of equipment.  The technology segment of the molecular diagnostics market is comprised of polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”), Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification Technology, hybridization, DNA sequencing and NGS, microarray, and others.

Based on products, the molecular diagnostics market is segmented into instruments, reagents, services and software.  Reagents occupy the largest market share and will also register the maximum growth rate in the forecasted period of 2013 to 2018.  These reagents include assays that detect and diagnose diseases and are also used as biomarkers that predict the biological properties of potential drug compounds. 

North America accounts for the largest share of the market and is poised to grow at a high rate in the forecast period from 2013 to 2018.  The growth can be attributed to the rising incidences of infectious diseases, cancer prevalence, and genetic disorders that are further adding to the overall prevalence of chronic diseases.  Europe is the second leading contributor to the molecular diagnostics market.  However, the growth of this region is expected to be sluggish in the forecast period and is estimated to grow at a lower CAGR than North America, due to factors such as the uneven reimbursement policies and the European economic crisis.  Asia is the most promising region for molecular diagnostics in the coming five years.  It is expected to grow at a higher CAGR than North America and Europe over the forecast period.  The large population base and improved purchasing power of patients are the major drivers of this market.  

We believe the liquid biopsy kit market will exceed $5.0 billion dollars by the year 2020. This market consists of instrument sales, detection and monitoring of prominent mutations in lung and colorectal cancer. There is a strong desire on the part of clinical research pathologists to utilize liquid biopsy testing at their institutions using broad and established next generation sequencing technology. Thirty percent of clinical molecular laboratories currently perform NGS based testing. Our new multigene, clinically actionable and highly sensitive panels and mutation enrichment technology offer industry-leading sensitivities that enable detection and monitoring of driver and resistance mutations associated with many of the common solid tumor cancers. We believe that our broad intellectual property portfolio positions us well within these markets to develop and market molecular diagnostic products. The use of urine as a sample should provide a paradigm shift in screening and monitoring practices as it provides an easier sample to acquire in a truly noninvasive fashion, with more nucleic acid targets 
14

present in the sample leading to greater sensitivity.  We believe these modified testing practices will most likely meet with wide physician and patient acceptance in oncology, infectious disease, transplantation, and potentially, prenatal diagnostics.
Commercial Markets — Internal Focus

Oncology

Cancer mutation testing and monitoring is the priority area for our scientists and commercial personnel.  Early data from ongoing clinical studies have shown that ctDNA analysis may be useful for determining the presence or absence of actionable mutations, and for monitoring therapeutic response and recurrence in solid tumor cancers.  Such testing could serve to help physicians make treatment decisions, monitor early and ongoing response to therapy or minimal residual disease after surgery, identify signs of early progression, or see markers of resistance emerge prior to clinical presentation.  Once therapy is completed, a simple urine or blood test can be used to monitor for early signs of disease recurrence over time.  The market for these tests, which is diagnosed cancer patients possessing mutations known to have clinical or therapeutic importance, is already established.  Use of urine- or blood based testing could be disruptive and change the pattern of use of other cancer monitoring tools, including imaging technologies, such as PET, CT and MRI scans.

According to the American Cancer Society’s (“ACS”) 2015 report, there are approximately 565,000 patients that die every year from cancer, not including cancers of the blood, bone marrow or lymphatic system.  Using this number as a proxy for metastatic cancers, it can be assumed that all of these patients are being treated within 12 months of death for their disease.  Testing and monitoring these patients for response to therapy or progression while on therapy, or for markers of resistance to therapy (like EGFR T790M for lung cancer), would be a natural extension of our technology.  The average lung, breast, or colon cancer patient receives between 18-21 radiographic imaging procedures (PET, CT, MRI, etc.) during the two years following their diagnosis.  This averages to approximately nine to ten scans per patient per year.  Use of a urine- or blood based monitoring test at the start of therapy, at several points in time during therapy, and at the completion of therapy would represent approximately six to ten separate testing events that could occur within a 12-month period.  At a reimbursed price of approximately $1,000 per test, the total available market (“TAM”) for treatment response monitoring in the U.S. could be worth between $3.0 billion and $5.0 billion annually.

Once patients with cancer, primary or metastatic, have completed therapy, they will require monitoring for possible progression and for the appearance of resistance markers, since many metastatic patients may remain on lower-dose “maintenance therapy” during the remainder of their lives, or until treatment is no longer considered an option.  According to the ACS, as of January 2014, there were nearly 14.5 million patients alive in the U.S. who had been treated for cancers that have metastatic potential.  Use of a urine- or blood based mutation monitoring test once a year at $1,000 per test would equate to a TAM for recurrence monitoring in the U.S. of approximately $14.5 billion annually.

Beyond cancer patients being actively treated or monitored over time, ctDNA testing may eventually emerge as a viable option for pre-cancerous screening.  This was recently evaluated in a cancer clinical study at Thomas Jefferson University, funded jointly by the NIH and the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”).  The study demonstrated that DNA fragments carrying a specific mutation (KRAS), and released from pre-cancerous colon polyps, can be detected in the urine of patients.

Studies have shown that cancer patients who have KRAS mutations do not respond successfully to treatment with anti-EGFR drugs such as Erbitux, Iressa, Tarceva, Tykerb, and Vectibix.

These anti-EGFR agents, particularly Erbitux and Vectibix, are a mainstay of treatment for colorectal cancer.  It has been estimated that 17%-25% of all human cancers have been found to harbor KRAS mutations, with mutation rates as high as 59%-90% in pancreatic cancers and 35%-40% in colorectal cancers.  These tumors have a low probability of responding to anti-EGFR drugs.  By first testing for KRAS mutations, physicians will be able to better manage their patients and avoid costly treatments that are unlikely to have a positive clinical response.

Screening and monitoring for KRAS and other key biomarker mutations (i.e. BRAF, EGFR, NRAS, PIK3CA, etc.) using urine-based tests would provide a simple, noninvasive, cost-effective, and convenient testing option, versus tissue biopsy, for physicians and patients.  Urine samples may even be collected in the patient’s home as required, or as requested by the physician.

Simple urine- and blood based assays would likely lead to improved personalized medicine for patients, resulting in the right drug being prescribed for the right patient at the right time.  We believe this technology will lead to an improved quality of life for patients and will become part of a new standard of care for those patients and physicians waging the fight on cancer.

Drug Development and Monitoring of Therapeutic Outcomes

Cell-free DNA diagnostic technology has significant potential as a simple, quick, noninvasive way of monitoring clinical responses to drugs in clinical development and evaluating patient-specific responses to already approved and marketed therapies.  Specific target applications include, but are not limited to, the detection of metastasis following tumor surgery, monitoring of response and tumor progression during chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiation therapy, development of optimal hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatment protocols, and monitoring of transplantation patients on immunosuppressive drugs.

With cancer today, it is often difficult to determine if a particular patient is responding to their current therapeutic regimen.  Generally, patients are re-examined periodically to determine if a tumor has grown in size, reduced in size (i.e., partial response), disappeared (i.e. no sign of disease - complete response) or remained the same (stable disease).  If the tumor has grown in size or remained the same, treatment may be adjusted.  By measuring and monitoring tumor specific genetic markers in a patient’s urine pre-, peri- and post-chemotherapy or targeted therapy, it may be possible to more quickly determine whether a patient is responding to therapy.  Use of ctDNA diagnostics may permit more rapid and real-time therapeutic decisions on a patient-specific basis.  Approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases are diagnosed annually, and there are several hundred companies developing therapeutic agents in the U.S. alone.  We believe this indicates a large potential application to use ctDNA diagnostic technology for both drug development and the monitoring of therapeutic outcomes.

One of the largest costs associated with development of a new therapy is the size of human clinical studies required to identify the cohort of responders, and the resulting statistical power required.  By measuring specific genetic markers, it may be possible to pre-identify, and subsequently screen, for the most likely responders to the therapy, and to limit patient recruitment to this subset.  This strategy could significantly reduce the cost to develop a drug and improve development timelines.  We believe that there is a significant commercial potential for our urine-based cell-free molecular diagnostic technology to be incorporated into these clinical trial protocols, and ultimately into post-approval patient identification protocol.
Commercial Markets — External Focus

We will seek to license and/or partner with other companies who have vested interests or commercial strengths in the following areas in order to develop applicable diagnostic and/or monitoring tests using our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology.
Infectious Diseases — HPV

The rationale for screening for HPV is that high-risk subtypes cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer.  We have developed a urine-based HPV test capable of screening for known high-risk HPV types that are associated with the development of cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in females, worldwide.  Deaths due to cervical cancer are a significant global problem, especially in developing countries where screening practices are inadequate.

According to the ACS, India alone accounts for 27% (77,100) of total worldwide cervical cancer deaths.  A recent clinical trial conducted in rural India found that a single round of HPV DNA testing was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of developing advanced cervical cancer and associated deaths.  In the U.S., better patient compliance and screening guidelines reduced cervical cancer death rates to only 4,290 cases in 2011.  The major drivers of poor screening in these developing regions are cultural acceptance, limited screening resources and funding, and poor cytology proficiency.  Further exacerbating the compliance hurdles is that the primary screening mechanism involves an invasive cervical scraping procedure (e.g., Pap smear).  It is generally agreed that the early detection of cervical cancer leads to much higher recovery rates and lower rates of invasive disease.
There is a tremendous unmet need for a new noninvasive, simple, private, and cost effective test to simplify the HPV screening process for patients and, in turn, improve compliance.  We believe our urine-based HPV test has the potential to address these market needs.

Other areas beyond HPV detection and monitoring include those infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.  Cell-free nucleic acid assays that detect molecular targets in organisms can provide a quick, accurate, simple, and cost effective method for screening and monitoring disease.  Specific areas of interest include testing for molecular targets from organisms that cause Lyme disease, John Cunningham Virus, valley fever, and various fungal infections.  These organisms 
16

all tend to be difficult to identify with current technology, making differential diagnosis especially challenging, thus delaying the start of potentially curative anti-infective treatment.

Transplantation

According to government statistics, there are approximately 28,000 solid organ transplants performed in the U.S. annually.  Post-transplant monitoring for organ rejection episodes requires a highly invasive tissue biopsy.  Approximately ten such biopsies are taken over a period of one year per patient.  Because organ rejection is marked by the early death of cells, we believe that an early indication of rejection can be identified by measuring a unique series of genetic markers characteristic of the organ donor that can be easily detected in random urine specimens from the transplant recipient.  Providing early evidence of tissue rejection is key to the administration and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies used to prevent rejection.  Given the annual number of transplants performed in the U.S. and the annual number of corresponding biopsies performed per patient, this would equate to a market opportunity in the U.S. of roughly 300,000 urine-based tests per year.  Transplantation monitoring with our technology offers opportunities for partnering with companies developing drugs for controlling tissue rejection, developing cell transplantation, or developing novel transplantation technologies.  This illustrates the breadth of commercial potential of our cell-free molecular testing platform technology, and we intend to leverage such potential applications to maximize stockholder value.

Technologies for the collection, shipment and storage of urine specimens, and cell-free nucleic acid extraction

Successful implementation of our cell-free nucleic acid technology in molecular testing is tightly linked to the availability of techniques and procedures for cell-free nucleic acid preservation, purification, and analysis.  Our strategic plan includes the allocation of sufficient resources for the creation of robust, feasible, and inexpensive approaches to improve the efficiency of working with urine samples. In November 2016, we entered into a long-term Supply and Distribution Agreement with Boreal, merging our respective technologies to co-develop urine and blood ctDNA assay kits and systems. Through this partnership, we intend to address an unmet need in the liquid biopsy testing market by providing an assay platform to enable simple, routine, low cost sample processing that can be run by NGS laboratories of research institutions, cancer centers, and service facilities around the world. Boreal and our Company have each contributed proprietary technology and methods to enhance ctDNA detection capabilities from urine and blood to develop a series of cancer specific multigene panels planned for launch in 2017. 
Our investment in the research and development of new nucleic acid preservatives or methods, which improve the stability of urine as a cell-free nucleic acid specimen led to the development of a new urine collection and DNA preservation cup (“Next™Collect”). We are also developing a DNA extraction and isolation kit (“Next™Extract”) that will make it feasible to further automate extraction and isolation of DNA from urine. Upon the completion of such projects, it is our expectation that a simple and streamlined method can be “kitted” as a stand-alone product to provide academic researchers with reagents that they can purchase and utilize in their own laboratories. 
Our research and development program serves three primary purposes: it will (1) accelerate the rate of publications and development of the body of evidence supporting urine as a viable specimen and, therefore, market acceptance of urine-based ctDNA testing, (2) create an RUO product for direct sale, and (3) provide a foundation for our technology transfer programs to partner reference laboratories seeking to bring ctDNA testing technology in-house.

Expansion of Analytically Validated Instrumentation, Systems, and Platforms

A unique element of our cell-free nucleic acid testing method is its design, which is focused on “counting” the target molecules already enriched through our initial proprietary specimen collection, isolation, and amplification procedures. This molecular counting is currently achieved in our CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory by using Illumina MiSeq systems as the detection platform; however, this molecular counting is not limited to just this type of system. Alternative NGS systems, Mass Spectrometry-based systems, ddPCR, or MicroArray reading systems may also be used in conjunction with our front-end sample preparation technology. As we expand our menu of targeted biomarker tests, we will also broaden the available platforms that can be used as detectors. When coupled with the RUO kitting program referenced above, the benefit of multiple analytically validated detection systems will increase the addressable market for our technology transfer program and future commercial partnerships.
Our Business Strategy

We plan to leverage our cell-free nucleic acid technology to develop and market, either independently or in conjunction with partners, molecular diagnostic products in our core market, oncology, as well as other markets including 
17

infectious disease, transplantation, and prenatal diagnostics. Our primary focus is utilizing our core technology in measuring ctDNA in urine and blood with our proprietary platforms, and research use only kits and reagents. We look to commercialize our technology by providing testing services from our CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory in San Diego, California as well as by distributing RUO kits and systems to clinical research laboratories, leading cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies.

The U.S. Congress passed the CLIA in 1988 to regulate development, evaluation, and use of LDTs.  The CLIA states that laboratories must demonstrate how well an LDT performs using certain performance standards.  Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease, or for the assessment of health, must comply with all applicable CLIA regulations.  These regulations, which were finalized in 2003, establish standards to help ensure the quality and accuracy of laboratory testing.  While most common laboratory tests are commercial tests, manufactured and marketed to multiple laboratories, some new tests are developed, evaluated, and validated within one particular laboratory.  These LDTs are used solely within that laboratory and are not distributed or sold to any other laboratories or health care facilities.

We may pursue FDA review and approval for our products in the future.  Assuming we receive FDA clearance or approval for our products, we would plan to market such urine- and blood based test kits with clinical claims for use.  We also intend to complete business partnerships (out-license agreements) with diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., Europe, Asia Pacific and the rest of the world as appropriate given market conditions and opportunities.  This strategy would provide both short-term (license fees) and long-term (royalty) revenue streams.  Licensees of our technology will use our platform technology in the clinical development of their products, to monitor patients taking their marketed products (i.e., TNF inhibitors) and in certain situations to develop, market and sell our cell-free molecular diagnostic technology in predefined fields of use and geographic territories.  We plan to become a fully vertically integrated business in which we develop, manufacture, register, market, and sell our products.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, and forming the basis of our business strategy for 2017, we are addressing a gap between single-gene PCR assays that can be limited by sample availability and expensive, broad, multigene panels hindered by low clinical sensitivity for mutation detection. In 2017 we plan to introduce our first pan-cancer multigene panel and to offer key institutions, cancer centers and research laboratories the opportunity to bring our proprietary technology and RUO kits in-house for clinical research purposes. We believe this strategy, coupled with strong clinical results supporting the use of our ctDNA molecular diagnostic technology, will lead to broad market adoption of our technology and kits.
Research and Development

As of December 31, 2016, we had 31 dedicated scientists located in our office in San Diego, California. Our research and development team is composed of researchers and scientists (Ph.Ds.), laboratory associate scientists, and experts in clinical development and regulatory affairs of molecular diagnostics.  We plan to introduce new products to the market for use as LDTs testing services from our CLIA lab or as RUO kits for clinical research by third party institutions. Information and documentation systems infrastructure (e.g., design history files and firewalls) must be in place to support the confidentiality of multiple partnering programs and the rigorous scientific and regulatory oversight needed for products in the in-vitro diagnostics markets. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $15.0 million, $10.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property

We consider the protection of our proprietary technologies and products to be a critical element in the success of our business.  As of December 31, 2016, our wholly-owned and licensed intellectual property included over 120 issued patents and over 60 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad.  The pending applications include multiple international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT applications”) that will be used as the basis for multiple additional patent applications.
One group of patents and patent applications includes seven U.S. patents, with 39 counterpart patents in Japan, China, Hong Kong and Europe, including the major markets of the European countries.  These patents are directed to the detection of nucleic acid sequences in urine and nucleic acid modifications and alterations in urine.  This patent family includes claims directed to prenatal analysis of fetal DNA, the determination of the sex of a fetus and the detection of diseases such as Down Syndrome caused by genetic alterations.  Other patented claims are directed to detecting and monitoring cancer through urine-based testing, nucleic acid screening, and monitoring in cases of transplantation and infectious diseases, including infection by viruses and pathogens, and other potential diagnostic and genetic testing applications.  Members of this patent group expire between 2018 and 2026. Additional pending claims are directed to the preparation of cell-free nucleic acids, as well as detection of short cell-free nucleic acid molecules which, if granted, will expire between 2028 and 2033.

A second group is directed to the detection of specific gene mutations and indicators of disease.  These include NPM1 mutations, BRAF mutations, SF3B1 mutations, HPV, AML, and hairy cell leukemia.  The detection includes analysis of cell-free nucleic acid molecules.  This group includes U.S. patent numbers 8,222,370 B1, 8,501,924 B1, 8,642,261 B1, 9,222,137 B1, and 9,435,265 B1 as well as four pending U.S. patent applications.  There are also 19 pending non-U.S. and PCT patent applications.  Members of this patent group expire between 2025 and 2034.

A third group is directed to our molecular detection platform utilizing proprietary probe chemistry on optical detectors such as complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (“CMOS”).  This platform technology utilizes a conjugated probe and optical detection of analytes in medical diagnostics.  This group includes one issued patent in Japan and patents in the major markets of Europe, with pending applications in the U.S. and Hong Kong.  Members of this patent group expire beginning in 2022.

Applications are also pending to protect proprietary methods of collecting, extracting, detecting and enriching small concentrations of short nucleic acid sequences, and detecting and monitoring mutations in diseases, such as cancer, over time. Currently, this group includes one issued U.S. Patent with counterparts in the major markets of Europe, and more than 25 pending applications worldwide.

Wherever possible, we seek to protect our inventions by filing U.S. patents as well as foreign counterpart applications in select other countries.  Because patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for at least eighteen months after the applications are filed, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of inventions set forth in such patent applications.  Our planned or potential products may be covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case continued development and marketing of our products would require a license.  Required licenses may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.  If we do not obtain these licenses, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to design around the patents, or we could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses are not possible.

We may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, which are difficult to protect.  We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.  To the extent that our employees or our consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Manufacturing and Distribution

In 2017, we will continue offering laboratory testing services of LDTs from our CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory. Our primary customers for these LDT’s are pharmaceutical companies and third party laboratories. In addition, we plan to offer our Next™Collect urine collection and DNA preservation cup, Next™Extract DNA extraction and isolation kit, and ERTHOS™ mutation enrichment system and associated pan-cancer multigene panels for RUO. We are working to establish manufacturing, kitting and distribution partners for our proprietary and branded new product offerings.
Reimbursement

Medicare and other third-party payors will independently evaluate our technologies by, among other things, a cost/benefit analysis, assessing other available options and reviewing the published literature with respect to the results obtained from our clinical studies.  Currently, CPT codes are available for molecular testing, which we believe will allow our technologies to be billed following completion of a test that has been prescribed by a physician for a patient.  We believe that the existence of current CPT codes with applicability to our tests will help facilitate Medicare’s reimbursement process, as well as that for third party insurance providers.

In 2017, we plan to continue developing and publishing clinical evidence around the utility and performance of our testing platform to ensure favorable reimbursement. The reimbursement environment for molecular diagnostics is rapidly evolving and the trend for regulators and payors is to place increased value and emphasis on proprietary, single-source tests with strong evidence of clinical utility. Importantly, under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), advanced laboratory developed tests, those involving analysis of multiple biomarkers or unique algorithms, will likely receive special treatment under the PAMA reimbursement scheme. Payors will continue to look for three levels of evidence when they decide 
19

whether or not to cover a test. The first is analytical validity, which refers to the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the test results. The second is clinical validity, which is the correlation of the test results with the clinical outcomes of interest. The third is clinical utility, which refers to how use of the test influences clinical decision-making and/or improving patient outcomes, which is well-documented in publications of our data.
Government Regulation

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries will be a significant factor in the development, production and marketing of any products that we may develop.  The nature and extent to which such regulation may apply will vary depending on the nature of any such products and the policy of each country.  Virtually all of our potential products will require regulatory allowance or approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization.  We may submit and obtain FDA approval or clearance for some or all of our diagnostic products.  Pursuing and receiving FDA approval or clearance may be vital to maximizing our customer base and revenue potential for our numerous products.

FDA clearance for our products may be obtained through submission of a 510(k) statement of equivalency.  Another regulatory option, albeit more complicated and expensive, is to pursue FDA approval by submitting a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) application.  A 510(k) submission requires that we show equivalency of results in a clinical study with parallel comparison against an existing and FDA-recognized reference method (predicate device).

The FDA also regulates the sale of certain reagents, including our potential reagents, used by laboratories under the LDT rules to perform tests.  The FDA refers to such reagents as Analyte-Specific Reagents (“ASRs”).  ASR’s generally do not require FDA pre-market approval or clearance if they are (1) sold to clinical laboratories certified under the CLIA to perform high complexity testing and (2) are labeled in accordance with FDA requirements, including a statement that their analytical and performance characteristics have not been established.  Prior to, or in lieu of, FDA approval, we can sell our reagents to laboratories that meet the established criteria.  The FDA also regulates all promotional materials and specifically prohibits medical and efficacy claims.

Assuming that FDA approval or clearance is received for our products, a number of other FDA requirements would apply to our manufacturing and distribution efforts.  Medical device manufacturers must be registered and their products listed with the FDA, and certain adverse events, such as reagent failures, significant changes in quality control and other events requiring correction and/or replacement or removal of reagents must be documented and reported to the FDA.  The FDA also regulates product labeling, promotion and, in some cases, advertising, of medical devices.  We must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation that establishes extensive requirements for design control, quality control, validation, and manufacturing.  Thus, even with FDA approval or clearance, we must continue to be diligent in maintaining compliance with these various regulations, as failure to do so can lead to enforcement action.  The FDA periodically inspects facilities to determine compliance with these and other requirements.
Competition

The medical diagnostic industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition.  Our competitors include medical diagnostic companies, many of which have financial, technical, and marketing resources significantly greater than our resources.  In addition, there are a significant number of biotechnology companies working on evolving technologies that may supplant our technology or make it obsolete.  Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures.  We are aware of certain development projects for products to prevent or treat certain diseases targeted by us.  The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of our products or product candidates.

We believe that direct competition in the area of cell-free DNA detection and analysis is precluded by our growing patent estate.  However, there are other companies working in the area of cell-free nucleic acids and circulating tumor cell (“CTC”) collection and analysis in blood plasma that could compete in similar clinical areas, including disease detection, therapeutic response monitoring and minimal disease detection.  These companies include Roche Cobas, Guradant, Foundation Medicine, Illumina, Inc., Thermo Fisher, Sysmex-Inostics GmbH and numerous other smaller companies, both in the research and development and early commercial development phases.  We believe that the advantages of our proprietary enrichment methodologies overcome the challenges of multiplexing broad mutation content while avoiding non-specific wild-type amplification that restricts the limit of detection capability and related sensitivity associated with PCR and Hybrid Capture based technologies.
