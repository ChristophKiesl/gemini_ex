Organization and Reorganization
 
Enigma BVI was incorporated on February 22, 2017 in the British Virgin Islands with limited liability as an investment holding company. Upon incorporation, Enigma BVI issued 50,000 shares at $1 each. Prior to the reorganization, Enigma BVI was owned 57.5% by Mr. Ratanaphon Wongnapachant, 2.5% by Ms. Chanikarn Lertchawalitanon, and 40% by S-Mark Co. Ltd., a KOSDAQ-listed corporation and 100% shareholder of Digiwork Korea.
 
Digiwork (Thailand) Co. Ltd was incorporated in Thailand with limited liability on November 24, 2016. Digiwork was also owned 57.5% by Mr. Ratanaphon Wongnapachant, 2.5% by Ms. Chanikarn Lertchawalitanon, and 40% by S-Mark Co. Ltd.
 
On May 15, 2017, Enigma BVI, Digiwork and the shareholders of Digiwork entered into the abovementioned VIE Agreements, pursuant to which Enigma BVI has contractual rights to control and operate the businesses of Digiwork. The change in control of and the acquisition of Digiwork by Enigma BVI have been accounted for as common control transactions in a manner similar to a pooling of interests, and there was no recognition of any goodwill or excess of the acquirers’ interest in the net fair value of the acquirees’ identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost at the time of the common control combinations. Therefore, this transaction was recorded at historical cost with a reclassification of equity from retained profits to additional paid in capital to reflect the deemed value of consideration given in the local jurisdiction and the capital structure of Enigma BVI.
 
On May 15, 2017, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Enigma Technology International Corporation (“Enigma BVI”), and all the shareholders of Enigma BVI, namely, Mr. Ratanaphon Wongnapachant, Ms. Chanikarn Lertchawalitanon, and S-Mark Co. Ltd. (collectively the “Shareholders”), to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enigma BVI in exchange for the issuance to the Shareholders of an aggregate of 31,500,000 restricted shares of IWEB, Inc.’s common stock (the “Reverse Merger”). The Reverse Merger closed on May 15, 2017. As a result of the Reverse Merger, Enigma BVI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On May 15, 2017, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announcing the completion of the business combination between the Company and Enigma BVI in accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. As a result of the transaction, Enigma BVI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the former shareholders of Enigma BVI became the holders of approximately 84% of the Company’s issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis immediately after the transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein Enigma BVI is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.  The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.
 
In September 2018, the Company incorporated Marvelous ERA Limited in the British Virgin Islands as a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Marvelous ERA”). Marvelous ERA is the 70% majority owner of One Belt One Network Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“OBON BVI”), which was incorporated in October 2018. OBON BVI is the sole parent of One Belt One Network (HK) Limited, a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong SAR in October 2018.
 
In June 2019, OBON BVI, OBON Thailand and the shareholders of OBON Thailand entered into the abovementioned VIE agreements, pursuant to which OBON BVI has contractual rights to control and operate the business of OBON Thailand.
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world, including Thailand and the U.S. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in Thailand.
 
Substantially all of our revenues are generated in Thailand. The Company’s business and services and results of operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Our office in Thailand has been closed and all of the Company’s employees in Thailand have been working from home from March 23, 2020 to May 7, 2020. Since May 8, 2020, our office in Thailand has been reopened and in normal operation. The quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings have negatively impacted our business including our wifi installation project. Our suppliers have negatively been affected, and could continue to be negatively affected in their ability to supply and ship wifi related devices and parts to us if there is any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19. Our customers that have been negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase our products and services, which may materially adversely impact our revenue. Some of our customers may require additional time to pay us or fail to pay us at all, which could significantly increase the amount of accounts receivable and require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts. The outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted our supply chain and logistics and caused shortage of active installation workers and service providers for our project and might continue to impose negative impact to our business operations. Some of our customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs that we work with cannot weather the COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted.

The global economy has also been materially negatively affected by the COVID-19 and there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The Thailand and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which would seriously affect investment in infrastructures including building wifi network and related installation business.
 
While future economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
 
Further, as we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the event that we require additional capital. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the outbreak. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.
 
Consequently, our results of operations have been adversely, and may be materially, affected, to the extent that the COVID-19 harms the Thailand and global economy. Any potential impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
 
Our Business Strategy
