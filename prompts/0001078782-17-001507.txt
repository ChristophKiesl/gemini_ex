ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, under the name Recursos Montana S.A. The Company’s principal activity was as a pre-exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties then owned by the Company. During this time, the Company was deemed a “shell company” in the pre-exploration stage of our business and was ultimately unable to commence exploration activities.
 
On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., whereby the Company acquired 100% of Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock equal 51% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at the closing, and cash consideration to Tanaris in the aggregate amount of $350,000. Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. was the owner of certain rights in connection with the marketing and sale of smart lithium-ion batteries and battery technologies for various industrial vehicles markets and related applications. On March 6, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc.
 
On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (“HFOI”), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the “HFOI Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders (the “HFOI Shares”) and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock (the “HMMR Shares”). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd. was formed in the State of Delaware on June 13, 2014.
 
On April 13, 2016, our board of directors approved a Plan of Merger (the “Plan of Merger”) under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Section 92A.180 to merge (the “Merger”) with our wholly-owned subsidiary Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. to Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. The Plan of Merger also provides for a 1 for 1,000 exchange ratio for shareholders of both the Company and Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., which had the effect of a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of our common stock. Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 13, 2016 and, on April 14, 2016, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval.

On May 3, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved our merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. Accordingly, thereafter the Company’s name was changed and our shares of common stock began trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under our new ticker symbol “HMMR” as of May 27, 2016.

Current Operations
 
Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is an alternative telecommunications carrier providing diversified fiber optic networking solutions, as well as high capacity broadband wireless access networks, presently in the New Jersey [Southern and Central region] and the Metro Philadelphia area. Our goal is to provide network access to under-served markets along the transatlantic landing corridors, and ultimately other U.S. and potentially international locations, that contains the flexibility to deliver cutting edge solutions to data centers, carriers and other various communication providers, aggregators, enterprise and under-served residential broadband customers.
 
In 2017, the Company introduced triple play services, consisting of telephone, internet and video, to the Company’s Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate and Longport markets in New Jersey.
 
The Company’s Competitive Solution
 
 The Company provides its services over a combination of leased dark fiber and its last mile wireless technology that is deployed using the latest DOCSIS 3.0 standard, which is fundamentally what cable technology is based on. This strategy allows for the use of tried and tested methodology utilizing cable modems that are produced in bulk and are inexpensive off-the-shelf items. We operate our wireless broadcast solution in the 28 and 31 Ghz frequencies, providing as much as 2.5 Gbps of capacity per sector in the cell range [up to 10Gbps per tower]. We have and will continue to purchase dark fiber [wherever possible] on the terrestrial fiber backhaul networks as well as in the metro fiber rings. Fiber spurs will then be deployed from fiber breakout splitters to leased towers where the wireless broadband transmitters are located. A single transceiver to the customer provides all the bandwidth needed to delivery HDTV in both broadcast and Video-on-Demand mode, ultra-high speed internet service as well as fixed voice services to each residential dwelling unit or corporate office suite.

Quality of Service Assurance
 
 Due to the fact that the cable modems share in the pool of bandwidth per sector on each tower, the constant available bandwidth ensures that the subscriber enjoys the most optimized broadband and TV experience possible. When the network is at peak capacity which normally occurs around 5pm to 9pm at night, the system will automatically pull more capacity off the fiber backbone to ensure that a good experience is maintained at all times. Customers that receive service over our wireless system first go through a validation process referred to as Quality of Service Test that ensures that the signal strength and Line-of-Sight requirements of the system are met. This ensures that each customer the Company installs has already been pre-approved for high quality service.
Employees
 
We currently have 12 full-time employees and 4 full-time management consultants.
