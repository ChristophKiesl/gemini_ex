Strategic Developments
On January 27, 2020, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the Company to explore strategic alternatives for each of its businesses to unlock shareholder value. During 2020, we made significant progress on this initiative. Laureate completed the sales of its operations in Chile, Malaysia, and Australia & New Zealand and signed definitive agreements to sell Walden University, its higher education institution in the U.S., as well as its operations in Brazil and Honduras. The Company expects to close the Brazil and Honduras transactions during the first half of the year. The closing for the Walden transaction is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2021.
For Laureate’s institutions in Mexico and Peru, the board decided after a thorough evaluation of all strategic options, including a potential sale, to continue to operate these assets under Laureate management. The decision to focus on a regional operating model in Mexico and Peru at this time does not preclude further engagement with potential buyers for those businesses. Laureate does not intend to provide further interim updates unless and until it believes disclosure is appropriate. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our exploration of strategic alternatives and our activities related to previously announced divestitures may disrupt our ongoing businesses, result in increased expenses and present certain risks to the Company.” 
COVID-19 Update
On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19” or the “virus”) outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In order to prevent the spread of the virus in our student communities, we closed all of our physical campuses in March 2020 and quickly activated our business continuity plans. In a matter of a few short weeks, all of our students were effectively transitioned to an online learning environment, at scale, and our staff and faculty were effectively moved to a fully remote environment. We believe that our institutions have a competitive advantage in online and distance learning given the investments that we have made in digital learning platforms over the past three-to-five years and believe that we are well-positioned to continue to serve our students through the pandemic.
While our universities continue to deliver learning online, they also are focused on planning for a safe return to campus, when appropriate to do so. Most of our universities are expecting to adopt a phased approach, prioritizing classes that require the use of labs and other physical resources. Consistent with local regulations and health authority recommendations, we will implement a range of precautions to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, to ensure the safe return of activity on our campuses. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust based on what is most appropriate for each market.
General
We operate a portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru. These institutions, which we collectively refer to as the Laureate International Universities network, are leading brands in their respective markets and offer a broad range of undergraduate and graduate degrees through campus-based, online and hybrid programs. Collectively, we have approximately 336,500 students enrolled at five institutions with over 50 campuses included in our Continuing Operations as of December 31, 2020. Our institutions in Mexico and Peru operate within scaled country networks, which provide advantages in terms of shared infrastructure, technology, curricula and operational best practices. More than 75% of our students are enrolled in programs of four or more years in duration. As of December 31, 2020, the vast majority of our students were enrolled at traditional, campus-based institutions offering multi-year degrees, similar to leading private and public higher education institutions in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our students were effectively transitioned to an online learning environment in early 2020 and remained online throughout the remainder of the year. Our institutions are focused on planning for a safe return to campus, when appropriate to do so. See “—COVID-19 Update.”
Our programs are designed with a distinct emphasis on applied, professional-oriented content for growing career fields and are focused on academic disciplines that we believe offer strong employment opportunities and high earnings potential for our students. We continually and proactively adapt our curriculum to the needs of the market. In particular, we emphasize science, 
technology, engineering and math (STEM) and business disciplines, areas in which we believe that there is large and growing demand, especially in developing countries. Students pursuing degrees in Medicine & Health Sciences, Engineering & Information Technology and Business & Management, our three largest disciplines, constitute over 70% of our total post-secondary enrollments. We believe that the work of our graduates in these disciplines creates a positive impact on the communities we serve and strengthens our institutions’ reputations within their respective markets. Our focus on private-pay and our track record for delivering high-quality outcomes to our students, while stressing affordability and accessibility, has been a key reason for our long record of success.
We believe that the higher education markets in Mexico and Peru present an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for affordable, quality higher education in those markets. We believe that the combination of the projected growth in the middle class, limited government resources dedicated to higher education, and a clear value proposition demonstrated by the higher earnings potential afforded by higher education creates substantial opportunities for high-quality private institutions to meet this growing and unmet demand. By offering high-quality, outcome-focused education, we believe that we enable students to prosper and thrive in the dynamic and evolving knowledge economy.
In many developing markets, traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds) have historically been served by public universities, which have limited capacity and are often underfunded, resulting in an inability to meet growing student demands and employer requirements. In addition, in many of these same markets, non-traditional students, such as working adults and distance learners, have limited options for pursuing higher education. With strong brands and highly reputed institutions in Mexico and Peru, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to address these market opportunities.

Our institutions in Mexico and Peru offer traditional higher education students a private education alternative, with multiple brands and price points in each market and innovative programs and strong career-driven outcomes. Additionally, through targeted programs and multiple teaching modalities, we are able to serve the differentiated needs of non-traditional students in these markets.
Our program and level of study mix for 2020 was as follows:

Our Segments
We have two reportable segments, which are summarized in the charts below. The following information for our segments is presented as of December 31, 2020.
Our Industry
We operate higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru. These markets are characterized by what we believe is a significant imbalance between supply and demand. The demand for higher education is large and growing and is fueled by several demographic and economic factors, including a growing middle class, global growth in services and technology-related industries and recognition of the significant personal and economic benefits gained by graduates of higher education institutions. At the same time, the respective Mexican and Peruvian governments often have limited resources to devote to higher education, resulting in a diminished ability by the public sector to meet growing demand, and creating opportunities for 
private education providers to enter these markets and deliver high-quality education. As a result, the private sector plays a large and growing role in higher education.
Favorable industry dynamics in Mexico and Peru driving growth in the higher education sector include the following:
Large, Growing and Underpenetrated Population of Qualified Higher Education Students. In many countries, including throughout Latin America and other developing regions, there is growing demand for higher education based on favorable demographics, increasing secondary completion rates and increasing higher education participation rates, resulting in continued growth in higher education enrollments. While global participation rates have increased for traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds), the market for higher education in Mexico and Peru is still significantly underpenetrated, at approximately 30% and 47%, respectively, as compared to approximately 62% in the United States.
Strong Economic Incentives for Higher Education. According to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), in countries that are members of the OECD, the earnings from employment for an adult completing higher education were approximately 54% higher than those of an adult with only an upper secondary education. We believe that the cumulative impact of favorable demographic and socio-economic trends, coupled with the superior earnings potential of higher education graduates, will continue to expand the market for private higher education.
Increasing Role of the Private Sector in Higher Education. In both Mexico and Peru, the private sector plays a meaningful role in higher education, bridging supply and demand imbalances created by a lack of capacity at public universities. In Mexico, private education providers constitute 35% of the total higher-education market (44% in states in which we have operations). In Peru, private education providers constitute 72% of the total higher-education market. In addition to capacity limitations, we believe that limited public resources, and the corresponding policy reforms to make higher education systems less dependent on the financial and operational support of local governments, have resulted in increased enrollments in private institutions relative to public institutions.
Increasing Demand for Online Offerings. We believe that increasing student demand, new instruction methodologies designed for the online medium, and growing employer and regulatory acceptance of degrees obtained through online and hybrid modalities will continue to drive online learning in Mexico and Peru. Moreover, increasing the percentage of courses taught online in a hybrid educational model has significant cost and capital efficiency benefits, as a greater number of students can be accommodated in existing physical campus space.
Our Strengths and Competitive Advantages
We believe that our key competitive strengths that will enable us to execute our strategy include the following:
Scaled Platform Institutions Across Country Networks. Our scale within the countries in which we operate facilitates distinct advantages for our students and allows us to leverage our operating model across multiple brands in Mexico and Peru.
Our in-country networks facilitate competitive advantages related to:
•Curricula and Programs. We are able to leverage our curricula and resources, allowing for the rapid deployment of new programs. Increasing amounts of our curricula are being standardized, allowing us to lower the cost of program development by reusing and sharing content, while improving the quality of our programs.
•Best Practices. Through collaboration across our in-country networks, best practices for key operational processes, such as campus design, faculty training, student services and recruitment, are identified and then rolled out to the institutions within each country.
•Unified Systems. Our scale also permits increased investment in unified technology systems and an opportunity to leverage standardization of processes, centralization of common services (such as information technology, finance and procurement) and intellectual property, and implementing a common operating model and platform for content development, digital campus experiences, student services, recruitment and administrative services within each country.
Leading Intellectual Property and Technology. We have developed an extensive collection of intellectual property. We believe that this collection of intellectual property, including online capabilities, campus management, faculty training, curriculum design and quality assurance, among other proprietary solutions, provides our students a truly differentiated learning experience and creates a significant competitive advantage for our institutions over competitors. We have made significant investments to 
create unified technology systems across our in-country networks. These systems will provide data and insights on a scale that we believe will allow us to improve student experience, retention rates and outcomes, while also enabling a more efficient and lower cost educational delivery model.
Leading Online Technology. Our commitment to digital teaching and learning has been manifested through significant investments in core technologies, as well as in human resources, training and development activities. These investments have been instrumental in establishing a deep level of expertise in online education, facilitating the design and delivery of high quality, effective and differentiated online courses in the markets in which we operate.
Long-Standing and Respected University Brands. We believe that we have established a reputation for providing high-quality higher education, and our institutions are among the most respected higher education brands in their local markets. Our institutions have long-established histories and are ranked among the best in their respective countries. 
In addition, many of our institutions and programs have earned the highest accreditation available, which provides us with a strong competitive advantage in local markets. For example, medical school licenses are often the most difficult to obtain and are only granted to institutions that meet rigorous standards. Throughout Mexico and Peru we operate 12 medical schools and seven dental schools. We believe that the establishment of our medical and dental schools further validates the quality of our institutions and programs and increases brand awareness.
Commitment to Academic Quality. We offer high-quality undergraduate, graduate and specialized programs in a wide range of disciplines that generate strong interest from students and provide attractive employment prospects. We focus on programs that prepare our students to become employed in high demand professions. Our curriculum development process includes employer surveys and ongoing research into business trends to determine the skills and knowledge base that will be required by those employers in the future. This information results in timely curriculum upgrades, which helps ensure that our graduates acquire the skills that will make them marketable to employers. We also are committed to continually evaluating our institutions to ensure we are providing the highest quality education to our students. External assessment methodologies, such as QS Stars™, allows us to identify key areas for improvement in order to drive a culture of quality and continual innovation at our institutions.
Attractive Financial Model.
•Private Pay Model. Essentially all of our revenues for 2020 were generated from private pay sources, as there are no material government-sponsored student loan programs in Mexico or Peru. We believe that students’ and families’ willingness to allocate personal resources to fund higher education at our institutions validates our strong value proposition.
•Revenue Visibility Enhanced by Program Length and Strong Retention. The length of our programs provides us with a high degree of revenue visibility. The majority of the academic programs offered by our institutions last between four and five years, and more than 75% of our students were enrolled in programs of at least four years or more in duration as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we actively monitor and manage student retention because of the impact it has on student outcomes and our financial results. Our historical annual student retention rate, which we define as the proportion of prior year students returning in the current year (excluding graduating students), was 79% on average over the last five years. Given our high degree of revenue visibility, we are able to make attractive capital investments and execute other strategic initiatives to help drive sustainable growth in our business.
•Attractive Margin Profile with Significant Operating Leverage. Our scale within each country provides significant advantages, enabling us to operate efficiently with attractive margin levels. We focus on optimizing our operations at the country level through our in-county networks.
Our Strategy
While the countries in which we operate currently are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not presently believe that the pandemic will materially impact our long-term strategy and initiatives. See “—COVID-19 Update” and “—Employees and Human Capital Management—Health and Safety” for information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students, faculty and staff. That said, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—An epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency, such as the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.”
The execution of our strategy will be enabled by the following initiatives:
Integration of Campus-Based Operations in Mexico and Peru. Our institutions in Mexico and Peru serve approximately 336,500 students in a relatively homogenous operating environment, creating a unique opportunity to harvest the benefits of scale. We believe that by implementing best practices within each country we will enable closer collaboration and facilitate innovation and improved student experiences. We believe that this unification will enable us to be more nimble in our day-to-day operations and will allow us to extract valuable insights from more data across our network. Further, we believe that integration will enable further innovation and efficiency in our academic model and operations, and allow us to expand our market share.
Leverage and Expand Existing Portfolio. We will continue to focus on opportunities to expand our programs and the type of students that we serve, as well as our capacity in our markets to meet local demand, leveraging our existing platform to execute on attractive organic growth opportunities. In particular, we intend to add new programs and course offerings, expand target student demographics and, where appropriate, increase capacity at existing campuses and through hybrid online opportunities, open new campuses and enter new cities in existing markets. We believe that these initiatives will drive growth and provide an attractive return on capital.
•Add New Programs and Course Offerings. We will continue to develop new programs and course offerings to address the changing needs in the markets. New programs and course offerings enable us to provide a high-quality education that we believe is desired by students and prospective employers.
•Expand Target Student Demographics. We use sophisticated analytical techniques to identify opportunities to provide quality education to new or underserved student populations where market demand is not being met, such as non-traditional students (e.g., working adults) who may value flexible scheduling options, as well as traditional students. Our ability to provide quality education to these underserved markets has provided additional growth opportunities to our network and we intend to leverage our management capabilities and local knowledge to further capitalize on these opportunities in new and existing markets.
•Increase Capacity at Existing and New Campus Locations. We will continue to make demand-driven investments in additional capacity throughout our network by expanding existing campuses and opening new campuses, including in new cities. We employ a highly analytical process based on economic and demographic trends, and demand data for the local market to determine when and where to expand capacity. When opening a new campus or expanding existing facilities, we use best practices that we have developed over more than the past decade to cost-effectively expedite the opening and development of that location.
Expand Online and Hybrid Education Programs. We intend to increase the number of our students that receive their education through fully online or hybrid programs to meet the growing demands of students. Our online initiative is designed to not only provide students with access to innovative programs and modern digital experiences, but also to diversify our offerings, increase our enrollments and expand our digital solutions in a capital efficient manner, leveraging current infrastructure and improving classroom utilization.
The percentage of student credit hours taken online in our campus-based institutions was approximately 28% at the end of 2019. During 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our students were effectively transitioned to an online learning environment, at scale. Once our students, faculty and staff are able to safely return to campus, we expect that our students will transition back to a more traditional campus-based environment, with blended learning modalities. With a common learning management system implemented across our universities, we believe that we have the expertise to continue to expand online and hybrid offerings to meet the growing demand for this market opportunity, allowing us to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors.
We continue to accelerate the advancement of online education programs and technology-enabled solutions that deliver high-quality differentiated student experiences for our institutions at scale.
Our strategy for the online opportunity includes the following components:
•Hybrid Online Programs. Traditional 18-24 year old students attending campus-based institutions are increasingly seeking digital learning experiences that are blended with in-person learning. We provide those students with a hybrid learning experience, mixing face-to-face classroom experience with technology through our online platform, which we believe improves the student experience by providing them with a wide range of online 
courses, interactive discussions, virtual experiences, digital resources, and simulations that enhance their learning experiences both within and outside the classroom.
•Fully Online Programs. Many students require flexible learning modules to accommodate work and personal responsibilities. Often, these students are working adults who are looking to either complete an undergraduate or post-graduate degree, or who want to gain a credential to accelerate or change careers. Our fully online programs provide students with a high-quality curriculum experience to achieve their goals.
Our Segments and Institutions
Effective September 30, 2020 (giving effect to discontinued operations and the renaming of our segments), Laureate offers its educational services through two reportable segments: Mexico and Peru.
We determine our segments based on information utilized by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. See Note 7, Business and Geographic Segment Information, in our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our operating segments and financial information about geographic areas; see also “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Segment Results” and “—Overview—Factors Affecting Comparability—Seasonality” in this Form 10-K.
The following table presents information about the institutions as of December 31, 2020 and excludes institutions that are part of discontinued operations as of that date.

Reportable Segment(Enrollment) | | Higher Education Institution | | Year Joined Laureate Network | | Year Founded
Mexico | | Universidad del Valle de México (UVM) | | 2000 | | 1960 
(194,000) | Universidad Tecnológica de México (UNITEC) | | 2008 | | 1966
Peru | | Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC) | | 2004 | | 1994 
(142,500) | CIBERTEC | | 2004 | | 1983
 | Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN) | | 2007 | | 1994

Competition
We face competition in both of our reportable segments. We believe that competition focuses on price, educational quality, reputation, brand positioning, location and facilities.
The market for higher education in Mexico and Peru is highly fragmented and marked by large numbers of local competitors. The target demographics are primarily 18- to 24-year-olds in the countries in which we compete. Public institutions tend to be less expensive, if not free, but limited in capacity. The top public universities in these market are selective, and many of the other public universities are less focused on practical programs aligned around career opportunities. This creates market demand for private educational providers. We compete with other private higher education institutions on the basis of price, educational quality, reputation and location. We believe that we compare favorably with competitors because of our focus on quality, professional-oriented curriculum and the competitive advantages provided by our network. There are a number of private and public institutions in both of the countries in which we operate, and it is difficult to predict how the markets will evolve and how many competitors there will be in the future. We expect competition to increase as the Mexican and Peruvian markets continue to develop.
See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—The higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.”
Intellectual Property
We currently own, or have filed applications for, trademark registrations for the word “Laureate,” for “Laureate International Universities” and for the Laureate leaf logo in the trademark offices of all jurisdictions in which we operate institutions of higher learning. We have also registered or filed applications in the applicable jurisdictions in which we operate for the marks “Laureate Online International” and “Laureate Online Education.” In addition, we have the rights to trade names, logos and other intellectual property specific to most of our higher education institutions, in the countries in which those institutions operate.
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, including Discontinued Operations, we had approximately 37,000 employees, of which approximately 3,000 were full-time academic teaching staff and 14,000 were part-time academic teaching staff. As of December 31, 2020, for Continuing Operations only, we had approximately 22,000 employees, of which approximately 2,000 were full-time academic teaching staff and 9,000 were part-time academic teaching staff. Our employees at our institutions outside the United States are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, as is customary or required under local law in those jurisdictions. At various points throughout the year, we negotiate to renew collective bargaining agreements that have expired or that will expire in the near term. We consider ourselves to be in good standing with all of the labor unions of which our employees are members and believe that we have good relations with all of our employees.
Commitment to Ethics and Values
Acting ethically and in accordance with the law is at the very core of who we are. Maintaining our integrity is more important than any financial gain. We have incorporated as a benefit corporation and believe that long-term success is linked to the delivery of strong outcomes for all out stakeholders.
The Laureate Code of Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) is central to that effort. Our Code sets out principles of integrity and ethical behavior, and our responsibilities to each other, our students, suppliers, stockholders and the public. The Code covers such topics as accurate records, proper use of assets and information, conflicts of interest, and bribery and corruption. The Code sets a baseline: it does not cover every issue that may arise, but it provides basic principles and a methodology to help guide us in the attainment of this common goal. The Code establishes common standards for Laureate Education, Inc. and all of our institutions. We maintain an Ethics Hotline, which is a secure, confidential resource for Laureate employees, faculty members, students and others to ask a question or raise a concern related to the Code or other ethics or compliance issues.
Further, as a Company, we will continue to use our platform to actively be non-discriminatory in all we do, we will promote diversity, inclusion and equality across our workplace, and we will inspire a generation of graduates to continue advancing these principles in their work and throughout their communities.
Health and Safety
The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff has been, and remains, a high priority. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every sector and every business around the world, with higher education experiencing a significant impact. Shortly after the World Health Organization declared the global pandemic, millions of students needed to move away from their campus-based, face-to-face classes and abruptly switch to online learning. For many years, we have had the capacity to deliver high-quality, digital learning experiences, and we acted quickly to leverage our existing technologies and learning platforms to serve students outside of the traditional classroom setting. In addition to transitioning to fully online delivery, we also effectively moved other essential functions, including student support services and marketing and enrollment, to a fully remote environment. We have communicated with our students, faculty and staff regularly throughout the pandemic to ensure that they remain informed of our response. While Laureate universities continue to deliver learning online, they also are focused on planning for a safe return to campus, when appropriate to do so. Most of our universities are expected to adopt a phased approach, prioritizing classes that require the use of labs and other physical resources. Consistent with local regulations and health authority recommendations, we will implement a range of precautions to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, to ensure the safe return of activity on our campuses.
We also moved quickly to support our corporate workforce transitioning to an entirely remote, online environment. We launched “Excelling Remotely,” an initiative to share resources, best practice and inspiration for employees to ensure a successful transition to remote work. In addition, we established a COVID-19 Employee Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to those experiencing financial hardship as a direct result of the pandemic.
Our History
Since making our first investment in global higher education in 1999, we have focused on expanding access to differentiated higher education and learning opportunities to traditionally underserved areas of the world. In August 2007, we were acquired in a leveraged buyout by a consortium of investment funds and other investors. On February 6, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering and shares of our Class A Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “LAUR”.
Public Benefit Corporation Status
In October 2015, we redomiciled in Delaware as a public benefit corporation as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission to benefit our students and society. Public benefit corporations are a relatively new class of corporations that are intended to produce a public benefit and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. Under Delaware law, public benefit corporations are required to identify in their certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits they will promote and their directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware also are required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose publicly at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives.
Our public benefit, as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, is to produce a positive effect (or a reduction of negative effects) for society and persons by offering diverse education programs delivered online and on premises operated in the communities that we serve. By doing so, we believe that we provide greater access to cost-effective, high-quality higher education that enables more students to achieve their academic and career aspirations. Our Continuing Operations are outside the United States, where there is a large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality higher education. Our stated public benefit is firmly rooted in our company mission and our belief that when our students succeed, countries prosper and societies benefit. Becoming a public benefit corporation underscores our commitment to our purpose and our stakeholders, including students, regulators, employers, local communities and stockholders.

Industry Regulation
Continuing Operations
Mexican Regulation
Mexican law provides that private entities are entitled to render education services in accordance with applicable legal provisions. These provisions regulate the education services rendered by the federal government, the states and private entities and contain guidelines for the allocation of the higher education role among the federal government, the states and the municipalities, including their respective economic contributions, in order to jointly participate in the development and coordination of higher education.
There are three levels of regulation in Mexico: federal, state and municipal. The federal authority is the Federal Ministry of Public Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública). Each of the 31 states and Mexico City has the right to establish a local Ministry of Education, and each municipality of each state may establish a municipal education authority that only has authority to advertise and promote educational services and/or activities.
Some functions are exclusive to the Federal Ministry of Education, such as the establishment of study plans and programs for Basic and Mid-Superior education services. There are also concurrent functions, such as the granting and withdrawal of governmental recognition of validity of studies (Reconocimiento de Validez Oficial de Estudios) (“REVOEs,” for its acronym in Spanish).
The General Law on Education (Ley General de Educación) in Mexico classifies studies in the following three categories: (i) Basic Education, which includes pre-school (kindergarten), elementary school and junior high school (secundaria); (ii) Mid-Superior Education, which includes high school (preparatoria) and equivalent studies, as well as professional education that does not consider preparatoria as a prerequisite; and (iii) Superior Education, which includes the studies taught after preparatoria, including undergraduate school (licenciatura), specialties (especialidades), master’s studies, doctorate studies and studies for teachers (educación normal).
The REVOEs are issued either by the Federal Ministry of Education under the General Law on Education or by any of the state Ministries of Education under the applicable state law. REVOEs are granted for each program taught at each campus. If there is a change in the program or in the campus at which it is taught, the entity will need to get a new REVOE.
The Federal Ministry of Education has issued a set of general resolutions (Acuerdos) that regulate the general requirements for obtaining REVOEs. The main Acuerdos are (i) Acuerdo 243, issued on May 27, 1998, which sets the general guidelines for obtaining an Authorization or REVOE; (ii) Acuerdo 17/11/17, issued on November 10, 2017, which sets the procedures related to REVOEs for Superior Education studies; and (iii) Acuerdo 18/11/18, issued on November 27, 2018, which defines the different levels, models and educational options at Superior Education. The Federal Ministry of Education recommends to the local Ministries of Education the adoption and inclusion of the provisions contained in Acuerdo 243 and Acuerdo 17/11/17 in the local Law on Education and other applicable local laws and regulations.
Depending on each state, other requirements may apply; for example, in certain states, private institutions that provide educational services with REVOEs need to be registered with the corresponding local authorities.
Acuerdo 17/11/17 regulates in detail the provisions contained under the General Law on Education to grant REVOEs for Superior Education studies, regarding faculty, plans and programs of studies, inspection visits, procedures, etc. Acuerdo 17/11/17 also provides that private institutions that provide Superior Education services in accordance with presidential decrees or secretarial resolutions (acuerdos secretariales) issued specifically to them may maintain the obligations provided to them thereunder and may function under the simplified provisions of Acuerdo 17/11/17. Currently, Universidad Tecnológica de México, S.C. and Universidad del Valle de México, S.C. have secretarial resolutions that were issued in their favor before the issuance of Acuerdo 17/11/17. The obligations contained in these secretarial resolutions generally conform to the obligations provided under Acuerdo 17/11/17.
The regulatory authorities are entitled to conduct inspection visits to the facilities of educational institutions to verify compliance with applicable legal provisions. Failure to comply with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, the cancellation of the applicable REVOE and the closure of the education facilities.
Private institutions with REVOEs are required to grant a minimum percentage of scholarships to students. Acuerdo 17/11/17 requires private institutions to grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered during each academic term. Scholarships consist, in whole or in part, of payment of the registration and tuition fees established by the educational institution.
Private entities may also obtain the recognition of validity of their programs from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México or “UNAM”). The General Regulations of Incorporation and Validation of Studies issued by UNAM provide that programs followed in private entities may be “incorporated” to UNAM in order for UNAM to recognize their validity.
The UNAM regulations also require private entities incorporated to UNAM to grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered at such entity. The students entitled to have this benefit will be selected by UNAM. Some of our high school programs and one of our medical programs are incorporated to UNAM.
A new higher education bill was approved by the senate on December 9, 2020, and we currently anticipate that the house of representatives will consider the legislation in the spring of 2021. Should the bill be enacted, no foreseeable material changes are expected to impact the business.
Peruvian Regulation
We operate three post-secondary education institutions in Peru, two of which are universities and one of which is a technical-vocational institute. Peruvian law provides that universities and technical-vocational institutes can be operated as public or private entities, and that the private entities may be organized for profit. The Ministry of Education has overall responsibility for the national education system.
In 2014, the Peruvian Congress enacted a new University Law to regulate the establishment, operation, monitoring and closure of universities. The law also promotes continuous improvement of quality at Peruvian universities. The law created a new agency, the Superintendencia de Educación Superior Universitaria (“SUNEDU”), which is responsible for carrying out the governmental role in university regulation, including ensuring quality. While institutional autonomy is still recognized, and universities are permitted to create their own internal governance rules and determine their own academic, management and 
economic systems, including curriculum design and entrance and graduation requirements, all of these matters are now subject to review and evaluation by SUNEDU through its periodic review of universities as part of a license renewal process.
Under the new law, university licenses are temporary but renewable, and are granted by SUNEDU for a maximum of eight years. On November 24, 2015, the Board of SUNEDU promulgated regulations for the university licensing process. For licenses to be renewed, universities have to demonstrate to SUNEDU that they comply with, at a minimum, certain Basic Quality Conditions (“BQCs”) (i.e., that they have specified academic goals and that the degrees granted and plans of study are aligned with those goals; that their academic offerings are compatible with their planning goals (e.g., there is sufficient labor demand for careers offered); that there are only two regular semesters of studies per year; that they have appropriate infrastructure and equipment; that they engage in research; that they have a sufficient supply of qualified teachers, at least 25% of whom will need to be full-time; that they supply adequate basic complementary educational services (e.g., medical and psychological services and sports activities); that they provide appropriate placement office services; and that they have transparency of institutional information). Both UPC and UPN had their licenses renewed in 2017, in each case for a period of six years.
Technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the Ministry of Education, which grants operating licenses for not less than three nor more than six years, after which the Ministry conducts a revalidation process. The approval of new institute licenses is based on the evaluation by the Ministry of the institute’s institutional goals, the curricula of its education programs and their link with careers needed in the Peruvian economy, the availability of adequate qualified teachers, the institute’s infrastructure, the institute’s financial resources, and the favorable opinion of the National System of Assessment, Accreditation and Certification of Education Quality (“SINEACES”) regarding the appropriateness of the programs that the institute is offering. SINEACES is also responsible for the accreditation of programs and careers at all higher education institutions. On November 2, 2016, a new law regarding technical-vocational institutes (the “Institutes Law”) was enacted. Under the Institutes Law, technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the Ministry of Education, which grants operating licenses. The Institutes Law created two types of institutes: Higher Education Institutes (“Institutes”) and Higher Education Colleges (“Colleges”). Institutes are dedicated to technical careers and Colleges are devoted to technical careers related to education, as well as science and information Technology. Colleges grant Technical Bachelor Degrees and Professional Technical Degrees. Institutes and Colleges are subject to a mandatory license granted by the Ministry of Education, based on an evaluation to determine compliance with BQCs. BQCs include: an appropriate institutional management guaranteeing a proper relation with the educational model of the institution; appropriate academic management and proper program studies aligned with the Ministry of Education norms; appropriate infrastructure and equipment to develop educational activities; adequate teachers and staff which, at a minimum, should consist of 20% full-time staff; and appropriate financial and economic provisions. The Institutes Law provides that the process will last no more than 90 days and will grant a license for a five-year period to be renewed once expired. Unlike licenses, quality accreditation is voluntary, except for certain careers for which it might be mandatory as determined by law. Such accreditation will be taken into consideration for access to public grants for scholarships and research, among other things. Private Institutes and Colleges may be organized as for-profit or not-for-profit entities under Peruvian law. Not-for-profit Colleges’ and Institutes’ income is exempt from taxes on their educational activities. For-profit Colleges and Institutes are subject to income taxes but may qualify for a tax credit on 30% of their reinvested income, subject to a reinvestment program to be filed with the Ministry of Education for a maximum term of five years. The specific requirements of such programs were determined by regulations in August 2017. According to the schedule determined by the regulations, in May 2018, Cibertec was granted a license by the Ministry of Education for a five-year period.
In November 2018, Laureate Education Peru SRL acquired Instituto de Educación Superior Tecnológico Privado Red Avansys S.A.C. (“Avansys”). Avansys is an Institute that offers 25 degrees to approximately 3,000 students in a single campus located in downtown Lima in an educational cluster for Institutes. Avansys obtained its license from the Ministry of Education in April 2018, for a five-year period. Cibertec and Avansys merged from a corporate and tax perspective as of February 1, 2019 and changed its corporate name to Instituto de Educación Superior Cibertec SAC. (“IES Cibertec”). During November 2019, the Ministry of Education issued a license for both entities (like separate entities for regulatory purposes) to permit cross selling of degrees in campuses of both the former Avansys and/or Cibertec. A merged license for IES Cibertec will be required.
Discontinued Operations
Brazilian Regulation
The Brazilian educational system is organized according to a system of cooperation among federal, state and local governments. Higher education (i.e., undergraduate and graduate level education provided by public and private higher education institutions (“HEI”)) is regulated primarily at the federal level, particularly in terms of public policy goals, accreditation and academic 
oversight. The legislative influence of state and municipal governments is generally restricted to taxation, real estate and operational permitting issues.
With respect to the federal role, the National Educational Basis and Guidelines Law (“LDB”), provides the general framework for the provision of educational services in Brazil and establishes the duty of the federal government to:
•coordinate the national education policy;
•ensure national process of evaluation of higher education institutions, with the cooperation of evaluation agencies that have responsibility for this level of education; and to create an evaluation process for the academic performance of elementary, secondary and higher education in collaboration with educational institutions in order to improve the quality of education; and
•issue rules and regulations regarding higher education.
The responsibility of the federal government in regulating, monitoring and evaluating higher education institutions and undergraduate programs is exercised by the Ministry of Education (“MEC”), along with a number of other federal agencies and related offices.
MEC
MEC is the highest authority of the higher education system in Brazil and has the power to issue implementing rules (regulations, notices, and technical advisories governing the conduct of higher education), as well as to regulate and monitor the higher education segment. By exercising its duties, MEC has the power to confirm decisions from the National Board of Education (“CNE”) regarding the accreditation and reaccreditation of institutions of higher education, as well as legal opinions and regulatory proposals coming from the Board. MEC is also responsible for validating the criteria and methodology employed by the National Institute of Educational Studies Anísio Teixeira (“INEP”).
CNE-National Board of Education
CNE is a consultative advisory and deliberative body of MEC. It consists of the Board of Basic Education and the Board of Higher Education, each composed of 12 members appointed by the President of Brazil. The Board of Higher Education has the power to (i) analyze and issue opinions on the results of higher education quality assessment; (ii) deliberate on the reports submitted by MEC on programmatic accreditation and qualifications offered by higher education institutions, as well as on prior authorization from those offered by non-university institutions; and (iii) approve the accreditation and periodic reaccreditation of higher education institutions, based on official reports and quality assessments.
CNE is also responsible for matters relating to the implementation of higher education norms and advising MEC on related matters.
INEP-National Institute of Educational Studies Anísio Teixeira
INEP is a federal agency linked to MEC that is the primary statistical and information-gathering body for the entire Brazilian education system. The performance data that it collects and publishes is used by MEC, the legislature and the rest of the executive branch, as well as the public, to debate and make policy and programmatic decisions about education. INEP is responsible for the National Higher Education Evaluation System (“SINAES”) and will coordinate and execute on-site visits to Higher Education institutions in the process of accreditation/reaccreditation of institutions and undergraduate programs.
CONAES-National Commission on Higher Education Evaluation
CONAES is a committee under MEC supervision composed of 13 members, created to coordinate and monitor SINAES. To fulfill that duty, CONAES can establish guidelines to be followed by INEP in the development of evaluation tools, as well as submit the list of programs to be evaluated by the National Examination of Student Performance (“ENADE”).
SERES-Higher Education Regulation and Supervision Secretariat
In 2011, SERES - which operates as a MEC branch - became the specific agency directly responsible for regulation and supervision of public and private HEIs, as well as undergraduate courses and lato sensu graduate programs, for both face-to-face and distance learning modalities. Its mission is to elevate the quality level of all higher education through the establishment 
of guidelines for the expansion of HEIs and their courses, in accordance with national curriculum guidelines and proprietary quality parameters.
SERES plans and coordinates the policy-making process for higher education and has been granted the power to (i) accredit HEIs and their undergraduate courses; (ii) oversee HEIs and courses, in order to fulfill the educational legislation and to induce improvements in quality standards; and (iii) design actions and update curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs, as well as benchmarks for quality distance education, considering curricular guidelines and various forms of technology. SERES can also establish guidelines for the preparation of assessment instruments for higher education courses and ultimately manages the public system of registration and database of HEIs and higher education programs. Finally, SERES can apply the penalties provided for in regulation, following due process.
According to the LDB, higher education can be offered by public or private higher education institutions. A private institution of higher education shall be controlled, managed and maintained by an individual person(s) or legal entity, in either case referred to as the “mantenedora.” The mantenedora is responsible for obtaining resources to meet the needs of the duly authorized HEI, which in regulatory terms is referred to as the “mantida.” A mantenedora may be authorized to operate more than one mantida. In any case, the mantenedora is legally and financially responsible for all of its mantidas. Each of our HEIs in Brazil is maintained by a Laureate-controlled mantenedora.
Regarding their organizational and academic prerogatives, institutions of undergraduate learning can be:
•Colleges (faculdades): Colleges are institutions of public or private education offering degree programs in more than one area of knowledge that are supported by a single supporting entity and have specific administration and management. Colleges may offer programs at the following levels: traditional undergraduate programs, technological undergraduate programs, specialization and graduate programs (master’s and Ph.D. degrees). Colleges do not have minimum requirements for the qualifications of professors and their labor practices and cannot establish new campuses or create programs and new locations without the prior permission of MEC.
•University Centers (centro universitários): University centers are public or private educational institutions that offer a variety of programs in higher education, including undergraduate programs, extension courses and lato sensu graduate programs-master’s and Ph.D. degrees; they must also provide learning opportunities and career development for their professors. At least one third of the faculty of a university center must be composed of persons with master’s or doctorate degrees. In addition, at least one fifth of its professors must be composed of professors who work full time. University centers have the autonomy to create, organize and extinguish individual courses and degree programs, as well as relocate or expand locations in their existing programs in the municipality in which the university center’s headquarters is located, without the prior permission of MEC. Under certain circumstances, university centers are allowed to open campuses outside the municipality in which its seat is located; however, such campuses will not enjoy the same autonomy prerogatives.
•Universities (universidades): Universities are public or private institutions of higher education that offer several degree programs, extension activities and development of institutional research. Like the university centers, at least one third of the faculty of a university must be composed of persons with master’s or doctorate degrees. In addition, at least one third of a university’s faculty must be composed of professors who work full time. Similar to university centers, universities have autonomy to create, organize and extinguish individual courses and degree programs, as well as to relocate or expand locations in their existing programs in the municipality in which the university’s headquarters is located, without prior permission of MEC. Additionally, universities have the ability, upon prior authorization by MEC, to apply for accreditation of new campuses and courses outside the municipality in which the university’s seat is located, provided that they are within the same state as the seat, and, under certain circumstances, autonomy might be extended to them as well.
Among the HEIs in the Laureate International Universities network are one faculdade (Faculdade Internacional da Paraíba, located in João Pessoa, PB), six university centers (Centro Universitário FADERGS, located in Porto Alegre, RS; Centro Universitário dos Guararapes, located in Jaboatão dos Guararapes, PE; FMU Education Group (formed by Centro Universitario das Faculdades Metropolitanas Unidas – FMU and Centro Universitario FIAM-FAAM), located in São Paulo, SP; Centro Universitário Ritter dos Reis, located in Porto Alegre, RS; and Centro Universitario IBMR, located in Rio de Janeiro, RJ), and three universities (Universidade Potiguar, located in Natal, RN; UNIFACS-Universidade Salvador, located in Salvador, BA; and Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, located in São Paulo, SP). Originally standalone HEIs, Faculdades Porto-Alegrense and Faculdade dos Guararapes de Recife have been integrated, respectively, to Centro Universitário Ritter dos Reis and Centro Universitário dos Guararapes. Also included are Business School São Paulo, a professional degree-granting premium branch owned and operated by Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, and CEDEPE Business School, a professional degree-granting 
premium branch owned and operated by Guararapes. As noted below, each form of HEI is entitled to a different level of autonomy within the regulatory framework. In turn, we factor the respective levels of autonomy into the operational strategy for each HEI, as the requirement of prior or post-facto MEC approval can delay or nullify specific new campus expansion projects, new course offerings, and increases in the number of authorized seats per course.
Legislation provides for specific levels of didactic, scientific and administrative autonomy to universities, university centers and colleges in differing degrees with the aim of limiting outside influence by other institutions or persons outside of the HEI’s internal governance structure.
The LDB provides that the following powers are guaranteed to universities and university centers in the exercise of their autonomy: (i) to create, organize and terminate undergraduate programs in their facilities, subject to applicable regulations; (ii) to establish the curriculum, subject to applicable general guidelines; (iii) to plan and execute scientific research, artistic production and extracurricular activities; (iv) to quantify the available seats for each program, except in specific undergraduate programs where the total number of available seats in the entire system is controlled by MEC in conjunction with the input of the relevant professional associations; (v) to prepare and amend their bylaws in accordance with the general applicable standards; and (vi) to grant degrees, diplomas and other qualifications.
Although colleges have administrative autonomy, they do not enjoy academic autonomy and, therefore, are subject to MEC’s prior authorization to create new programs and degree programs.
Distance education. Distance Education, or Educação a Distância (“EaD”), in Brazil is primarily regulated by the LDB. The law defines EaD as an educational modality in which the didactic and pedagogical measurement in teaching and learning processes occur with the use of media, information and communication technologies, with students and teachers developing educational activities at a different place and/or time.
EaD programs can be offered at different levels and types of higher education, covering continuing education programs, undergraduate, specialization, master’s and Ph.D., as well as professional education (including technical, medium and technological level of higher education). Universities and university centers accredited to offer EaD programs may create, organize and terminate programs, upon notice to MEC. Colleges (‘faculdades’) must seek prior MEC authorization.
The new regulatory framework for distance education (Decree # 9.057/2017) significantly reduced the regulatory and operational hindrances to the expansion of undergraduate and postgraduate, allowing a specific accreditation to offer EaD programs exclusively, without the need of a prior face-to-face HEI accreditation, making it possible to create a HEI dedicated to EaD programs, with lower operational costs and reduced regulatory complexity. Further, another characteristic of EaD programs in Brazil-the mandatory presence of brick-and-mortar support facilities, or ‘polos’, for in-person activities such as professional practice labs and exams-has been relaxed, thus making full online programs possible.
Under the new regulation, the need for classroom activities to be developed at the polos will be determined by the pedagogical projects of the respective programs, according to an HEI’s own discretion. However, curriculum guidelines published by the National Board of Education may require activities to be developed in laboratory or professional settings, which may compromise some of this prerogative.
The decree also eliminated the need for prior polo accreditation, which becomes another prerogative of the accredited HEIs. However, a maximum number of new polos to be created annually by HEIs was stipulated, based on their institutional evaluation, or CI score (resulting from official onsite evaluations). HEIs with a CI score equal to 3 can create up to 50 new polos per year, whereas those with CI score of 4 can create 150 new polos. HEIs with a maximum CI score equal to 5 can create up to 250 new polos per year.
HEIs offering EaD programs, including their polos, are subject to inspection by MEC at any time, as to determine compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. EaD certificates or diplomas issued by accredited HEIs have national validity, with the same force and effect as those issued for face-to-face programs.
As a means of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, MEC issued a series of regulations allowing activities developed in the face-to-face programs to be provided online, though preserving certain peculiarities, such as their synchronous character. All planning to resume face-to-face classes is subject to the sanitary conditions assessed by the States and will follow the respective protocols.
Accreditation. The first accreditation of an institution of higher education is necessarily as a college. The accreditation as a university or university center is only granted after the institution has operated as a college for at least six years and has demonstrated that it has met satisfactory quality standards, including positive evaluation by the SINAES, as well as met legal 
requirements applicable to each type of institution of undergraduate learning, including minimum degree attainment and terms of faculty employment.
Following accreditation, colleges must obtain MEC permission to offer new undergraduate degree programs. As consequence of their autonomy, universities and university centers do not require MEC authorization to create programs in the city in which the university’s or university center’s headquarters are located. They need only inform MEC about the programs they offer for registration, evaluation and subsequent recognition. However, the creation of graduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry, nursing and psychology, whether by colleges, universities or university centers, are subject to the opinion of the proper professional associations.
Once a non-autonomous institution gets authorization to offer a particular program, it has to seek accreditation in the period between 50% and 75% of the program’s completion. Institutional and programmatic accreditation has to be renewed periodically in accordance with the regularly applicable MEC evaluation process.
Decree n. 9.235, published in December 2017, condensed various directives present in several normative instruments and set procedural standards and decision models for accreditation. The new regulation eliminated the need for a previous mandatory decision of MEC, which effectively granted wider autonomy to HEIs. Such autonomy, however, is tied to a performance score beyond the merely satisfactory grade in the official evaluation integrated with the accreditation process.
This increased autonomy primarily benefits university-like structures (i.e., universidades and centros universitarios). As already mentioned, Universidades are now allowed to have the same autonomy prerogatives at their satellite campuses as they already enjoy at their headquarters, such as program creation, seat openings, etc. They must, however, sustain above average performance scores and the same minimum proportion of faculty (one-third) working full time and/or with a master’s/Ph.D. at each campus receiving autonomy. Centros universitarios, once geographically limited to the headquarters municipality, are now allowed to expand statewide, although there will be no autonomy prerogatives for such units; their new programs and seat expansion initiatives will have to be authorized by MEC.
Evaluation. SINAES was established to evaluate HEI as institutions of higher education, traditional degree and technology degree programs and student academic performance, so as to improve the quality of higher education in Brazil. In practice, the CONAES conducts the monitoring and coordination efforts of SINAES. The results of the institutional and course evaluations are represented on a scale of five levels, and when facing unsatisfactory results, the HEI will be required to enter into an agreement with MEC to establish a remediation initiative. Failure to comply, in whole or in part, with the conditions provided in the term of commitment may result in one or more penalties imposed by MEC, including temporary suspension of the opening of the selective process for undergraduate programs and cancellation of accreditation or reaccreditation of the institution and the authorization for operation of its programs.
External evaluations of institutions of higher education are carried out by INEP in two instances, first, when an institution applies for its first accreditation, and second, by the end of each of SINAES’s evaluation, primarily based on the following criteria: (i) institutional development plan; (ii) social and institutional responsibility; (iii) infrastructure and financial condition; and (iv) pedagogical monitoring of student academic performance.
The evaluation of graduate programs is made by the Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement, which is responsible for establishing the quality standard required of master’s and doctoral programs, along with the identification and evaluation of the courses that meet this standard.
The evaluation of student academic performance is conducted by INEP, which requires each student to sit for the ENADE in order to verify the knowledge and technical skill of the student body. Each ENADE test is developed in accordance with the content and specific curriculum of each educational program. Students enrolled in undergraduate programs take the ENADE every three years. In this system, students are evaluated at the end of the last year of each program.
Transfer of control. Although changes of control exercised by Laureate do not ordinarily need MEC prior approval or review, due to the level of Laureate’s consolidated gross revenues throughout Brazil, current Brazilian law requires that every control transaction, with limited exceptions, that Laureate enters into must be submitted to the Brazilian anti-trust authority, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economico (the “CADE”), for approval. Such request for approval must be granted prior to the definitive closing of such transaction. CADE has the power to reject and/or alter any transaction or any part of a transaction that it deems to unduly restrict competition.
Incentive programs. Programa Universidade Para Todos (“PROUNI”) is a federal program of tax benefits designed to increase higher education participation rates by making college more affordable. PROUNI provides private HEIs with an exemption 
from certain federal taxes in exchange for granting partial and full scholarships to low-income students enrolled in traditional and technology undergraduate programs. All of our HEIs adhere to PROUNI.
HEIs may join PROUNI by signing a term of membership valid for ten years and renewable for the same period. This term of membership shall include the number of scholarships to be offered in each program, unit and class, and a percentage of scholarships for degree programs to be given to indigenous and Afro-Brazilians. To join PROUNI, an educational institution must maintain a certain relationship between the number of scholarships granted and the number of regular paying students. The relationship between the number of scholarships and regular paying students is tested annually. If this relationship is not observed during a given academic year due to the departure of students, the institution must adjust the number of scholarships in a proportional manner the following academic year.
An HEI that has joined PROUNI and remains in good standing is exempt, in whole or in part, from the following taxes during the period in which the term of membership is in effect:
•IRPJ (income tax) and CSLL (social contribution), with respect to the portion of net income in proportion to revenues from traditional and technology undergraduate programs; and
•Cofins (Contribution for the Financing of Social Security) and PIS (Program of Social Integration), concerning revenues from traditional and technology undergraduate programs.
A number of municipal and state governments have sought to replicate PROUNI by creating their own programs that, for example, offer tax incentives through a reduction in, or credits against, the ISS (Municipal Services Tax) in exchange for scholarships to targeted social groups or professions. Laureate owns and operates HEIs in several jurisdictions in which such local incentive programs are in force.
Student financing program. Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil (“FIES”) is a federal program established to provide financing to students enrolled in courses in private institutions of higher education that have achieved a minimum satisfactory evaluation according to SINAES and receive a grade of 3 or higher out of 5 on the ENADE.
Under this basic structure, FIES targets both of the government’s education policy goals: increased access and improved academic quality outcomes. The HEI receives the benefit of the FIES program through its participation in the intermediation of CFT-E (Certificado Financeiro do Tesouro) bonds, which are public bonds issued to the HEI by the federal government that the HEI may use to pay the national social security tax imposed by the INSS (National Social Security Institute) and certain other federal tax obligations. If the HEI is current with its taxes (i.e., it possesses a tax clearance certificate and is not otherwise involved in any tax-related disputes with the federal government that are not being defended in compliance with applicable security/bond requirements), then the HEI also has the option to sell the bonds for cash in a public auction conducted by one of the government-sponsored banks.
Following changes initiated in 2014, a new FIES reform was implemented by Law n. 13.530/2017, which amended the original FIES legal statute (Law n. 10.260/2001). The current FIES offer conditions were first consolidated for the 2018.1 candidate selection.
The traditional FIES financing program continues to be offered to candidates with a family income of up to three times the minimum wage, and while the previous 18-month grace period was eliminated, financing will have a zero interest rate. The risk is borne by a new guarantee fund-called FG-FIES-which may have initial public contributions of up to R$ 3 billion, and contributions from HEIs ranging from 13% for the first year, between 10% and 25% for the second to fifth year (according to delinquency-related variances), and at least 10% from the sixth year on.
The second financing offer-called P-FIES-originally had two variables, according to the funding sources (either the Constitutional/Regional Development Funds or the BNDES). The distribution of vacancies for this modality favors programs offered in corresponding regional limits and is operated strictly by financial agents, who bear the risks of the operation, but are entitled to charge for interest.
Further reforms were implemented in December 2019, following government claims that program sustainability should be a primary concern to the traditional FIES program, as well as to promote meritocracy as part of eligibility criteria. Therefore, better academic performance will be required from applicants.
On the other hand, there was considerable flexibilization for P-FIES, the most significant being to disregard the applicant’s family income as a condition to financing access. P-FIES will also free candidates from the usual selection via ENEM (Exame 
Nacional do Ensino Medio-the official, non-mandatory high school national examination promoted by MEC), as well as allow students to apply for financing at any time, and for private banks to offer credit lines, effectively untying P-FIES from the traditional FIES annual chronogram and original modelling.
Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, several measures to assist beneficiaries were implemented, such as temporary payment suspension and deadline extension for renewing contracts.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 4.3% of our students in Brazil participated in FIES, representing approximately 8.5% of our Brazil 2020 net revenues.
U.S. Regulation
U.S. institutions of higher education that are eligible to receive Title IV federal student aid funds must obtain and maintain approvals from the U.S. Department of Education (the “DOE”), the state(s) in which they are located and an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE, i.e., the U.S. regulatory triad. 
Walden University, our postsecondary educational institution in the United States, is subject to extensive regulation by the DOE, accrediting agencies and state educational agencies. The regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover substantially all of the operations of Walden University, including its educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, finances, results of operations and financial condition.
As an institution of higher education that grants degrees and diplomas, Walden University is required to be authorized by appropriate state educational agencies. In addition, the DOE regulates Walden University due to its participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the U.S. Higher Education Act (the “HEA”), or Title IV programs. Title IV programs currently include grants and educational loans provided directly by the federal government, including loans to students and parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the “Direct Loan Program”). The Direct Loan Program offers Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans. A significant percentage of students at Walden University rely on the availability of Title IV programs to finance their cost of attendance.
In addition to complying with specific requirements contained in the HEA and regulations issued thereunder by the DOE, in order to participate in Title IV programs, Walden University also is required to maintain authorization by an appropriate state educational agency or agencies and be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE.
We plan and implement our business activities to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies. Historically, Walden University has maintained eligibility to access Title IV funding.
State Education Authorization and Regulation
Walden University is required by the HEA to be authorized by applicable state educational agencies in the states in which it is located to participate in Title IV programs. To maintain requisite state authorizations, Walden University is required to continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs and various operational and administrative procedures. These standards can be different from and conflict with the requirements of the DOE and other applicable regulatory bodies. State laws and regulations are subject to change and may limit our ability to offer educational programs and offer certain degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE and may require the posting of surety bonds. Failure to comply with the requirements of applicable state educational agencies could result in us losing our authorization to offer educational programs in those states and in applicable state educational agencies forcing us to cease enrolling students in their state. Alternatively, the state educational licensing agencies could restrict the institution’s ability to offer certain degree or diploma programs. The loss of an authorization by the state in which the institution is based could also impact the ability of such institution to participate in Title IV programs.
Walden University is authorized by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, the applicable state educational licensing agency of its home state, to operate and to grant degrees or diplomas, which authorizations are required for students at the institution to be eligible to receive funding under Title IV programs. Additionally, we review the licensure or authorization requirements of other states to determine whether our activities in those states may constitute a presence or otherwise may require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies. Several states have asserted jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state, but that have some activity in the 
state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, conducting practica or sponsoring internships in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. 
In recent years, regional state compacts have created the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (“NC-SARA”), which is a voluntary agreement among member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. As of the date of this filing, all states except California participate in NC-SARA. NC-SARA requires each participating institution to have a federal composite score as measured by the DOE at the parent level of a 1.5 (or a 1.0 with justification acceptable to the state). Walden University does not participate in NC-SARA because the most recent federal composite score for Laureate as measured by the DOE is below 1.0. Accordingly, Walden University must apply for and comply with each state’s authorization requirements. Many states have established or are proposing legislation or regulations to create new or different criteria for authorization of “non-SARA” institutions, including requiring them to post bonds and/or meet composite score requirements. If Walden University does not meet these requirements, it may not enroll students in that state.
Additionally, the DOE recently revised its state authorization requirements pertaining to distance education. On November 1, 2019, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering post-secondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. The final regulations also eliminated or revised certain disclosure requirements applicable to institutions participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs. The DOE will also recognize, but not require, authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, if the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own general-purpose laws or regulations outside of the state authorization of distance education. These regulations became effective on July 1, 2020.
In recent years, the proprietary education industry has experienced broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of increased investigations and enforcement actions. State attorneys general and educational authorizing agencies in several states, as well as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions.
State Professional Licensure
Many states have specific licensure requirements that an individual must satisfy to be licensed as a professional in specified fields, including fields such as education and healthcare. These requirements vary by state and by field. A student’s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors, which may include, but are not limited to: the background and qualifications of the individual graduate; whether the institution or the program was approved by the applicable state agencies in the state in which the graduate seeks licensure; whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state; whether the institution or the program is accredited and, if so, by what accrediting agencies; and whether the institution’s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work. Several states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields, such as teaching and nursing. In several states, an educational program must be accredited by an accrediting agency affiliated with a professional association in order for graduates to be licensed in that professional field. In the field of psychology, an increasing number of states require approval by either the American Psychological Association (“APA”) or the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (“ASPPB”). To date, Walden University has been unable to obtain approval of its Ph.D. program in Counseling Psychology from the ASPPB or APA.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas, including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources and financial stability. To be recognized by the DOE, accrediting agencies must comply with DOE regulations, which require, among other things, that accrediting agencies adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions, conduct peer review evaluations of institutions and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review or review when necessary by its accrediting agencies to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation. Walden University is institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. Accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission is important to us for several reasons, one being that it enables eligible students at Walden University to receive Title IV financial aid. In addition, other colleges and universities depend, in part, on an institution’s accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers also rely on the accredited status 
of institutions when evaluating candidates’ credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs consider accreditation as assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.
In addition to institution-wide accreditation, there are numerous specialized accrediting agencies that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. Accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting agencies signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies. In addition to being accredited by regional and/or national accrediting agencies, Walden University also has the following specialized accreditations:
•the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs accredits the M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, M.S. in Marriage, Couple and Family Counseling, M.S. in Addictions Counseling, M.S. in School Counseling and Ph.D. in Counselor Education and Supervision programs;
•the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education accredits the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing and Doctor of Nursing Practice programs;
•the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs accredits the B.S. in Business Administration, Master of Business Administration, Doctor of Business Administration and Ph.D. in Management programs and granted Specialized Accounting Accreditation to the B.S. in Accounting and M.S. in Accounting programs;
•the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (formerly the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education) accredits the initial teacher preparation programs in the Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership;
•the Project Management Institute Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Program accredits the M.S. in Project Management program;
•the ABET accredits the B.S. in Information Technology program;
•the Council on Social Work Education accredits the master’s in social work program and the bachelor’s in social work program;
•the Council on Education for Public Health accredits the master’s in public health program; and
•the American Nurses Credentialing Center accredits continuing education certificates in nursing education, nursing informatics and nursing leadership and management.
Congressional Activity
The U.S. Congress must authorize and appropriate funding for Title IV programs under the HEA and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. Congress reauthorizes the HEA, which governs federal financial assistance for higher education, generally every five to ten years. The HEA was most recently reauthorized in August 2008. In addition to comprehensive reauthorizations of the HEA, Congress may periodically revise the law and other statutory requirements governing Title IV programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for federal fiscal year 2021 included a number of significant changes to federal student aid policy, including changes to the needs analysis applicable to certain Title IV programs, expanded eligibility for Pell Grants and a repeal of the limitation on lifetime subsidized loan eligibility for undergraduate students. It is likely that there will be bills introduced in the current 117th Congress to reauthorize and further amend the HEA. In addition to Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits under other federal programs. Congress has the authority to determine the funding levels for programs benefiting eligible veterans and military personnel. We cannot predict the timing and terms of any eventual HEA reauthorization, including any potential changes to institutional participation or student eligibility requirements or funding levels for particular Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, or the nature of any future revisions to the law or regulations related to these programs.
Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by the DOE. An institution must, among other things, be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state or states in which it is located and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting 
agency recognized by the DOE. The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit educational institutions have caused Congress to require the DOE to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit educational institutions. As a result, for-profit educational institutions, including ours, are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
Significant aspects of Title IV programs include the following:
Eligibility and certification procedures. Walden University must apply periodically to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control or expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers. The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution’s program participation agreement with the DOE. In addition, the DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution or make any other significant change. If the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. Walden University currently is provisionally certified to participate in Title IV programs on a month-to-month basis. The provisional certification is due to both Laureate’s failing composite score under the DOE’s financial responsibility standards (see below) and the DOE’s approval of Laureate’s initial public offering in February 2017, which it viewed as a change in control. In addition, the certification is month-to-month because Walden University’s most recent certification period expired, but remains in effect on a month-to-month basis while the DOE reviews the pending pre-acquisition review application relating to the acquisition of Walden University by Adtalem Global Education Inc. (“Adtalem”). Walden University also is subject to a letter of credit and is subject to additional cash management requirements with respect to its disbursements of Title IV funds, as well as certain additional reporting and disclosure requirements.
Administrative capability. DOE regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements; have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs; have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels; have various procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV program funds and for maintaining required records; administer Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; provide financial aid counseling to its students; refer to the DOE’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; submit all required reports and financial statements in a timely manner; and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, the DOE may require the institution to repay Title IV funds its students previously received, change the institution’s method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution’s receipt of those funds, place the institution on provisional certification status or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution’s participation in Title IV programs.
Financial responsibility. The HEA and DOE regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Walden University must satisfy to participate in Title IV programs. The DOE evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution’s annual audited financial statements, as well as when the institution applies to the DOE to have its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs recertified. The most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution’s composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the DOE based on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio, which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability and ability to borrow; (2) primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and (3) net income ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit or within its means. The DOE assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The DOE then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the 
institution. The composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further DOE oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with Title IV program requirements, meet all of its financial obligations including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements.
If the DOE determines that an institution does not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors, the institution is able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the DOE. This alternative basis could include, in the Department’s discretion, posting a letter of credit, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements, agreeing to receive Title IV program funds under an arrangement other than the DOE’s standard advance funding arrangement, such as the reimbursement method of payment or heightened cash monitoring, or complying with or accepting other limitations on the institution’s ability to increase the number of programs it offers or the number of students it enrolls.
The DOE measures the financial responsibility of Walden University on the basis of the Laureate consolidated audited financial statements and not at the individual institution level. Based on Laureate’s composite score for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the DOE determined that it and, consequently, Walden University, failed to meet the standards of financial responsibility. As a result, in a letter sent to Laureate on September 11, 2020, the DOE required Laureate to decrease its existing letter of credit to $83.6 million (10% of the Title IV program funds that the schools received during the most recently completed fiscal year), continued the institutions on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 and required Laureate to continue to comply with additional notification and reporting requirements, including submitting bi-weekly cash flow statements for Laureate and monthly student rosters of the institutions, which has been a requirement since April 2018. Although the DOE does not measure the financial responsibility of Walden University at the individual institutional level, the DOE has calculated an unofficial composite score for Walden University for state authorization purposes, and the score is 2.9 out of a possible 3.0.
Any requirement to provide, maintain or increase a letter of credit or other sanctions that may be imposed by the DOE could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and could affect our cash flows. The DOE has the discretion to increase our letter of credit requirements at any time. If Walden University is unable to meet the minimum composite score requirement or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility, and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility, then students at Walden University could lose their access to Title IV program funding.
On September 23, 2019, the DOE published final regulations regarding, among other things, events that the DOE considers early warning signs of financial difficulty, the occurrence of which may require an institution to provide the DOE with a letter of credit or other surety. These regulations became effective on July 1, 2020. The regulations also include provisions regarding the treatment of operating leases in the financial responsibility composite score methodology, more specifically define and require disclosures concerning the composite score’s inclusion of debt obtained for long-term purposes, and revise limited aspects of the composite score formula to account for changes in accounting terminology. For additional information regarding this rule and new regulations, see “—Borrower Defense-to-Repayment.”
When a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws from school, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has “earned.” The institution must return any unearned Title IV program funds to the appropriate lender or the DOE in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under DOE regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of the withdrawn students in the audit sample in the institution’s annual Title IV compliance audit for either of the institution’s two most recent fiscal years or in a DOE program review triggers this letter of credit requirement.
The “90/10 Rule.” A requirement of the HEA commonly referred to as the “90/10 Rule” provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenue, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues for any fiscal year from Title IV program funds. This rule applies only to proprietary post-secondary educational institutions, including Walden University. An institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if it exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years, and an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to addition conditions or sanctions imposed by the DOE.
Using the DOE’s formula under the “90/10 Rule,” Walden University derived approximately 76% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in each of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The ability of Walden University to maintain 90/10 rates below 90% will depend on our enrollments, any increases in students Title IV funding eligibility in the future, and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for the purposes of the 90/10 calculation. In recent years, several members of Congress have introduced proposals and legislation that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One such proposal would revise the 90/10 Rule to an 85/15 rule and would count DoD tuition assistance and GI Bill education benefits toward that limit. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, these actions could result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting the 90/10 Rule.
Student loan defaults. Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of federal student loans received under Title IV programs exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, the DOE calculates a rate of student defaults on such loans for each institution, known as a “cohort default rate.” Under current regulations, an institution will lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its three-year cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for three consecutive cohort years or 40% for any given year.
Walden University’s official cohort default rates for the 2017, 2016 and 2015 federal fiscal years were 6.8%, 6.9% and 7.3%, respectively. The average national student loan default rates published by the DOE for all institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 9.7%, 10.1% and 10.8%, respectively, and for all proprietary institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 14.7%, 15.2% and 15.6%, respectively.
Incentive compensation rule. Under the HEA, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds if such payments are based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. Failure to comply could result in monetary penalties and/or sanctions imposed by the DOE, which could result in lower enrollments, revenue, and net operating income. The law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, creating uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation, rendering development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish.
In addition, in recent years, other post-secondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as “qui tam” cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institutions’ compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals (a “relator”) on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the government’s recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages.
Substantial misrepresentation. The DOE has specific rules prohibiting substantial misrepresentations to students, members of the public, accrediting agencies and state licensing agencies, as well as the DOE. In the event that the DOE determines that an institution engaged in a substantial misrepresentation, it can revoke the institution’s program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution’s participation in Title IV programs, deny participation applications on behalf of the institution, or seek to fine, suspend or terminate the institution’s participation in Title IV programs. These regulations provide grounds for private litigants to seek to enforce the expanded regulations through False Claims Act litigation.
Compliance reviews. Walden University is subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the DOE, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, various state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans and accrediting agencies. In general, after the DOE conducts a site visit and reviews data supplied by an institution, the DOE sends the institution a program review report and affords the institution with an opportunity to respond to any findings. The DOE then issues a final program review determination letter, which identifies any liabilities.
Our institutions are subject to regulatory oversight and from time to time must respond to inquiries about their compliance with the various statutory requirements under which they operate. On September 14, 2020, Walden University received a letter from the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (referred to herein as “DOJ”) indicating that the DOJ is examining whether Walden University, in the operation of its Masters of Science in Nursing program (referred to herein as the “Nursing Program”), may have violated the Federal False Claims Act by misrepresenting compliance with its program participation agreement with the DOE, which agreement covers Walden University’s participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the U.S. Higher Education Act. The letter invites Walden University to provide information regarding a number of specific areas primarily related to the practicum component of its Nursing Program, but it makes no allegations of any misconduct or wrongdoing by Walden University. Further, on November 9, 2020, Walden University received notice from 
the Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”) that a public “Governmental Investigation” designation would be assigned to Walden University due to the DOJ inquiry and such designation became effective on November 9, 2020. On November 24, 2020, representatives of Walden University met with individuals from the DOJ to present the information requested. While Laureate is cooperating with the DOJ’s request to voluntarily provide information, it cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter. At this time, Laureate does not believe that this matter will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Further, consistent with the HLC’s policies and procedures, a Governmental Investigation designation by the HLC could delay or prevent the HLC’s approval of a substantive change application to approve the pending sale of Walden University. We continue to evaluate these regulatory developments and the potential impact, if any, on the pending sale of Walden University.
On September 8, 2016, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (“MOHE”) sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students as part of a program review that MOHE was conducting. On October 23, 2019, MOHE completed its program review and issued a final report that indicated no findings of noncompliance. As part of its report, MOHE made recommendations for Walden University to develop certain goals and benchmarks with respect to its doctoral programs.
As part of the DOE’s ongoing monitoring of institutions’ administration of Title IV programs, the HEA also requires institutions to annually submit to the DOE a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and DOE audit standards. In addition, to enable the DOE to make a determination of an institution’s financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with DOE regulations.
Borrower Defense-to-Repayment.
On November 1, 2016, the DOE published a rule that, among other provisions, established new standards and processes for determining whether a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (“Direct Loan Program”) borrower has a defense to repayment (“DTR”) on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses (the “2016 DTR regulations”). Among other topics, the 2016 DTR regulations established permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims would be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers’ claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the DOE of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. These aspects of the 2016 DTR regulations are applicable to loans disbursed under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2017 and before July 1, 2020.
On September 23, 2019, the DOE published final regulations regarding DTR, financial responsibility and certain other matters (the “2019 DTR regulations”). The 2019 DTR regulations became effective on July 1, 2020. Among other things, the 2019 DTR regulations modify the process and standards by which borrowers can assert a defense to the borrowers’ obligation to repay certain Title IV loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020. A borrower may assert a defense to repayment if he or she can establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the participating institution misrepresented a material fact on which the borrower reasonably relied when deciding to undertake the loan, so long as the misrepresentation “clearly and directly” relates to initial or continued enrollment at the institution, concerns the institution’s provision of educational services, and also results in financial harm to the borrower. The 2019 DTR regulations establish revised definitions for misrepresentation and financial harm and generally require a borrower to assert his or her defense to repayment within three (3) years from the date on which the student ceased to be enrolled at the institution. The 2019 DTR regulations also give the DOE five (5) years in which to seek recovery of the discharged amount from the institution, after a final written decision that a borrower is entitled to a defense to repayment. The 2019 DTR regulations also modify the “triggers” that the DOE considers early warning signs of financial difficulty, the occurrence of which may require an institution to provide the DOE with a letter of credit or other surety. The 2019 DTR regulations also include provisions regarding the treatment of operating leases in the financial responsibility composite score methodology, more specifically define and require disclosures concerning the composite score’s inclusion of debt obtained for long-term purposes, and revise limited aspects of the composite score formula to account for changes in accounting terminology.
DOE Distance Education Rulemaking Activities. On November 1, 2019, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and accreditation requirements, and those regulations became effective on July 1, 2020. For additional information regarding this new regulation, see” –State Education Authorization and Regulation.” On August 24, 2020, the DOE issued final regulations making changes to regulations that impact distance education programs in particular. The final regulations provide new definitions for, among other terms, correspondence courses, distance education, and academic engagement. Walden University offers both course-based distance education programs and direct assessment distance education programs through its Tempo Learning offerings. Under these new regulations, it is possible that students eligible for Title IV federal student aid funds who are enrolled in Walden University’s Tempo Learning 
programs will receive their funds on a more regular disbursement pattern that is better aligned with their individualized progression. The final regulations have an effective date of July 1, 2021, but the DOE will allow institutions to opt for early implementation of portions of these regulations.
Privacy of student records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and the DOE’s FERPA regulations require educational institutions to, among other things, protect the privacy of students’ educational records by limiting an institution’s disclosure of a student’s personally identifiable information without the student’s prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the DOE may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution’s receipt of further federal funds. In addition, Walden University is obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”), a federal law designed to protect consumers’ personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. Compliance with GLBA requirements also is a condition of Walden University’s continued Title IV Program participation. The GLBA and the applicable GLBA regulations require an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use and disclosure of student information. The institution must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a section of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts.
Potential effect of regulatory violations. If Walden University fails to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, the DOE could impose one or more sanctions, including requiring us to repay Title IV program funds, requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate our participation in Title IV programs or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution. Because Walden University is provisionally certified to participate in Title IV programs, the DOE may revoke its certification without advance notice or advance opportunity for us to challenge that action.
In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as current or former students or employees and other members of the public.
Regulatory Standards that May Restrict Institutional Expansion or Other Changes in the United States
Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations or other changes in the United States are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies.
Implementing new educational programs and increasing enrollment. The requirements and standards of state education agencies, accrediting agencies and the DOE limit our ability in certain instances to implement new educational programs or increase enrollment in certain programs. Many states require review and approval before institutions can add new programs. Walden University’s state educational agencies and institutional and specialized accrediting agencies that authorize or accredit Walden University and its programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution.
With respect to the DOE, if an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new educational program, the institution must generally apply to the DOE to have the additional educational program designated as within the scope of the institution’s Title IV eligibility. As a condition for an institution to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis, as in our case, the DOE can require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add or the extent to which an institution can modify existing educational programs. If an institution that is required to obtain the DOE’s advance approval for the addition of a new program fails to do so, the institution may be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program.
Change in ownership resulting in a change in control. The DOE and many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control. Under the DOE’s regulations, an institution that undergoes a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to the DOE to reestablish such eligibility. If an institution files the required application and follows other procedures, the DOE may temporarily certify the institution on a provisional basis following the change in control, so that the institution’s students retain continued access to Title IV program funds. In addition, the DOE may 
extend such temporary provisional certification if the institution timely files certain required materials, including the approval of the change in control by its state authorizing agency and accrediting agency and certain financial information pertaining to the financial condition of the institution or its parent corporation.
The types of and thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and accrediting agencies. Certain accrediting agencies may require that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in control, structure or organization for the institution to retain its accredited status. In addition, in the event of a change in control, structure or organization, certain accrediting agencies may require a post-transaction focused visit or other evaluation to review the appropriateness of its approval of the change and whether the institution has met the commitment it made to the accrediting agency prior to the approval. Other specialized accrediting agencies also require an institution to obtain similar approval before or after the event that constitutes a change in control under their standards. Many states include the transfer of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval. Some state educational agencies that regulate us may require us to obtain approval of the change in control to maintain authorization to operate in that state, and, in some cases, such states could require us to obtain advance approval of a change in control.
Walden University has filed a pre-acquisition review application with the DOE in connection with the contemplated acquisition of Walden University by Adtalem. Walden has also filed applications for approval of the change of ownership with its primary accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, and with various state educational agencies and programmatic accrediting agencies that require that such changes be approved prior to their occurrence.
