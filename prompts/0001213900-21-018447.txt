ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Formation
 
Samsara Luggage, Inc. (the “Company” or “Samsara”) was incorporated on May 7, 2007 under the name, “Darkstar Ventures, Inc.” under the laws of the State of Nevada. From the date of its formation until May 2011, the Company did not have any business activity except for the development of its website and locating companies through which it could offer products. Once its proprietary website was officially launched in July 2011, the Company engaged in the business of marketing eco-friendly health and wellness products, such as air and water filtration systems, organic baby products, and eco-friendly beds and linens through affiliate marketing arrangements.
 
On May 14, 2015, the founder of the Company, Chizkiyau Lapin, sold all of his shares of common stock of the Company, then constituting 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, to Mr. Avraham Bengio. Beginning in April 2016, the Company began to focus, through its wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewal Ltd. (“Bengio Urban Renewal”), in the area of real estate development, particularly on the urban renewal market in Israel. As a result of the business activities of Bengio Urban Renewal, the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, which was filed on November 14, 2016, stated that the Company was no longer a “shell” company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On March 17, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (the “Certificate of Change”) to effect a reverse split of Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-7,000 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split took effect at the open of business on Tuesday, March 23, 2021. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each seven thousand (7,000) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding was automatically combine into one (1) new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding shares common stock was reduced from 5,995,825,131 shares to 856,647 shares.
Merger Transaction
 
On November 12, 2019, the Company completed its merger with the Delaware corporation that was previously known as “Samsara Luggage, Inc.” (“Samsara Delaware”) in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 10, 2019, (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Samsara Delaware, and Avraham Bengio, pursuant to which Samsara Delaware merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). Following the completion of the Merger, the business of the Company going forward became the business of Samsara Delaware prior to the Merger, namely, the development and sale of smart luggage products.
 
The Company filed (1) Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in which the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from “Darkstar Ventures, Inc.” to “Samsara Luggage, Inc.” (the “Name Change”); and (2) a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in which the Company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company from 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock to 5,000,000,000 shares of common stock.
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company and Avraham Bengio entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to which the Company sold 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewal and all of the Company’s interest in Bengio Urban Renewal (including all debts and liabilities owed by the Company to Bengio Urban Renewal and the debts of Bengio Urban Renewal to the Company) to Avraham Bengio, the former CEO and principal shareholder of the Company (prior to the Merger).
 
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Samsara, $0.0001 par value, was converted into the right to receive 0.0654 shares of the Company’s common stock, such that the shareholders of Samsara Delaware were issued new shares of the Company representing approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock following the completion of the Merger. The exchange rate was determined through arms’-length negotiations between the Company and Samsara Delaware.

Business Strategy
 
Samsara designs, manufacturers, and sells high quality luggage products to meet the evolving needs of frequent travelers. The Company also seeks to present new technologies within the aluminum luggage industry, including an aluminum “smart” suitcase.
 
Samsara believes that aluminum is an untapped segment within the premium luggage market, with only few manufacturers currently in the industry. Samsara’s aluminum suitcase contains a 6061aluminum alloy that combines titanium, magnesium and zinc to create a lightweight and durable natural material. The structure of the suitcase is designed to provide both convenience and ample storage space. The suitcase contains an ergonomic design with a flat top that can be used as a desk allowing the user to work on the go. The suitcase also contains a variety of storage options, including an opening log and a wheel design that creates additional packing space. The suitcase’s interior includes packing bags, toiletry bag, garment bag, and gym bag, all illuminated by an interior LED light. The suitcase comes in two colors, black and gray.
 
Furthermore, the suitcase contains an anodized coating, which is an electrolytic process that increases the natural oxide layer of the suitcase. The coated surface provides extra protection and a long-lasting appearance. It provides strength without adding weight and protects the suitcase from scratches, corrosion and weather damage. The anodized coating also gives the suitcase its color.
 
The “smart” components of the suitcase include a LED light control inside the suitcase, and an alert system that informs the owner of the suitcase’s location if the suitcase is opened. Samsara’s proprietary mobile application connects to sensors in the suitcase for 24/7 connectivity. The suitcase’s battery status and LED interior light can be remotely monitored via the mobile application. The suitcase also contains a battery and charging port for charging laptops and mobile phones, that is USB-C compatible.
 
In 2020, Samsara implemented a new marketing strategy and online infrastructure, based on its digital assets and a direct-to consumer (D2C) approach. Most of the Company’s marketing is currently directed to the end consumer and Samsara’s promotional efforts are aimed at the digital world and online sales.
 
Due to COVID-19, Samsara postponed the launch of its Next-Gen line of suitcases that were presented in January 2020 at the SEC exhibition. The Company decided to make changes to its business plan and developed alternative product lines to create a new revenue stream during the Corona virus pandemic. These new products are all sold online by Samsara’s digital unit utilizing the Company’s digital assets.

Part 15 of the FCC Rules requires operation of electronic equipment not to cause harmful interference and to accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recommends that only TSA approved locks be used on luggage, to avoid risk of TSA agents breaking the lock for inspection. The European Union requires all electronic devices to comply with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (ROHS) regulations which restricts the use of specific hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products. BS EN 62471 gives universal best-practice recommendations for the photobiological safety of electric lamps and lighting systems, including LED lights. This standard specifies exposure limits, measurement techniques and classification systems to control photobiological and light hazards. The EU radio equipment directive establishes a regulatory framework for placing radio equipment on the market, setting requirements for safety and health, electromagnetic compatibility, and the efficient use of the radio spectrum. Additionally, smart luggage products are subject to airline regulations applicable to manufacturing materials, size and weight.
