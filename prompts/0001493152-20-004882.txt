Item 1. Business.
 
We are a diversified coal producing limited partnership formed in Delaware that is focused on coal and energy related assets and activities. We produce, process and sell high quality coal of various steam and metallurgical grades from multiple coal producing basins in the United States. We market our steam coal primarily to electric utility companies as fuel for their steam powered generators. Customers for our metallurgical coal are primarily steel and coke producers who use our coal to produce coke, which is used as a raw material in the steel manufacturing process.
 
We have a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31, 2019, we controlled an estimated 277.6 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves, consisting of an estimated 171.1 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 106.5 million tons of metallurgical coal. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we controlled an estimated 190.7 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. Periodically, we retain outside experts to independently verify our coal reserve and our non-reserve coal deposit estimates. The most recent audit by an independent engineering firm of our coal reserve and non-reserve coal deposit estimates was completed by Marshall Miller & Associates, Inc. as of December 31, 2019, and covered a majority of the coal reserves and non-reserve coal deposits that we controlled as of such date. We intend to continue to periodically retain outside experts to assist management with the verification of our estimates of our coal reserves and non-reserve coal deposits going forward.
 
We operate underground and surface mines located in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia and Utah. The number of mines that we operate will vary from time to time depending on a number of factors, including the existing demand for and price of coal, depletion of economically recoverable reserves and availability of experienced labor.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we produced approximately 3.2 million tons of coal from continuing operations and sold approximately 3.0 million tons of coal from continuing operations.
 
Our principal business strategy is to safely, efficiently and profitably produce and sell both steam and metallurgical coal from our diverse asset base in order to resume, and, over time, increase our quarterly cash distributions. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to expand and diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of long-term, cash generating natural resource assets. We believe that such assets will allow us to grow our cash available for distribution and enhance the stability of our cash flow.
 
Current Liquidity and Outlook
 
As of December 31, 2019, our available liquidity was $0.1 million. We also have a delayed draw term loan commitment in the amount of $25 million contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the financing agreement discussed below.
 
On December 27, 2017, we entered into a financing agreement (“Financing Agreement”) with Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Collateral Agent and Administrative agent, CB Agent Services LLC, as Origination Agent and the parties identified as Lenders therein (the “Lenders”), which provides us with a multi-draw loan in the original aggregate principal amount of $80 million. The total principal amount is divided into a $40 million commitment, the conditions for which were satisfied at the execution of the Financing Agreement and a $40 million additional commitment that was contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the Financing Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, we had utilized $15 million of the $40 million additional commitment, which results in $25 million of the additional commitment remaining. We used approximately $17.3 million of the initial Financing Agreement net proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding and terminate the amended and restated credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The Financing Agreement initially had a termination date of December 27, 2020, which was amended to December 27, 2022 per the fifth amendment to the Financing Agreement discussed further below.

Beginning in the later part of the third quarter of 2019, we have experienced significantly weaker market demand and have seen prices move lower for the qualities of met and steam coal we produce. This downward price trend has been exacerbated by the recent coronavirus pandemic. If we continue to experience weak demand and prices continue to lower for our met and steam coal, we may not be able to continue to give the required representations or meet all of the covenants and restrictions included in our Financing Agreement. If we violate any of the covenants or restrictions in our Financing Agreement, including the fixed-charge coverage ratio, some or all of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, and our Lenders may not be willing to make any loans under the additional commitment available under our Financing Agreement. If we are unable to give a required representation or we violate a covenant or restriction, then we will need a waiver from our Lenders under our Financing Agreement, or they may declare an event of default and, after applicable specified cure periods, all amounts outstanding under the Financing Agreement would become immediately due and payable. Although we believe our Lenders are well secured under the terms of our Financing Agreement, there is no assurance that the Lenders would agree to any such waiver. Failure to obtain financing or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could cause us to further curtail our operations and reduce spending and alter our business plan. We may also be required to consider other options are currently considering alternatives to address our liquidity and balance sheet issues, such as selling additional assets or seeking merger opportunities, and depending on the urgency of our liquidity constraints, we may be required to pursue such an option at an inopportune time.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we were unable to demonstrate that we have sufficient liquidity to operate our business over the next twelve months from the date of filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K and thus substantial doubt is raised about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an emphasis paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. The presence of the going concern emphasis paragraph in our auditors’ report may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our customers, vendors, lenders and employees, making it difficult to raise additional financing to the extent needed to conduct normal operations. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
 
We continue to take measures, including the suspension of cash distributions on our common and subordinated units and cost and productivity improvements, to enhance and preserve our liquidity in order to fund our ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures and meet our financial commitments and debt service obligations.

The Fifth Amendment (i) extended the maturity of the Financing Agreement to December 27, 2022, (ii) provided a $5.0 million term loan provided by the Lenders to us under the delayed draw feature of the Financing Agreement, (iii) extended the period by which an applicable premium payable to the Lenders will be calculated to December 31, 2021, (iv) modified certain definitions and concepts to account for our recent acquisition of properties from Blackjewel, (v) permitted the disposition of the Pennyrile mining complex and (vi) provided for the payment of additional fees to the Lenders, including a consent fee of $1.0 million, an amendment fee of $825,000 and an increase in the lender exit fee of 1.00% to a total exit fee of 7.0% of the amount of term loans made under the Financing Agreement that is payable at the maturity of the Financing Agreement.
 
On March 2, 2020, we entered into a sixth amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Financing Agreement. The Sixth Amendment, among other things, provides a consent by the Origination Agent to a $3.0 million delayed draw term loan and increases the lender exit fee payable by the Partnership to the Lenders upon the maturity date (or earlier termination or acceleration date) by an additional 1.0%.
 
Distribution Suspension
 
Pursuant to the Partnership’s limited partnership agreement, our common units accrue arrearages every quarter when the distribution level is below the minimum level of $4.45 per unit. Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and continuing through the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we have suspended the cash distribution on our common units. For each of the quarters ended September 30, 2014, December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, we announced cash distributions per common unit at levels lower than the minimum quarterly distribution. We have not paid any distribution on our subordinated units for any quarter after the quarter ended March 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2019, we had accumulated arrearages of $907.2 million.
History
 
Our predecessor was formed in April 2003 by Wexford Capital. We were formed in April 2010 to own and control the coal properties and related assets owned by Rhino Energy LLC. On October 5, 2010, we completed our IPO. Our common units were originally listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RNO”. In connection with the IPO, Wexford contributed their membership interests in Rhino Energy LLC to us, and in exchange we issued subordinated units representing limited partner interests in us and common units to Wexford and issued incentive distribution rights to our general partner. Through a series of transactions completed in the first quarter of 2016, Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (“Royal”) acquired a majority ownership and control of the Partnership and 100% ownership of the Partnership’s general partner.

On April 27, 2016, the NYSE filed with the SEC a notification of removal from listing and registration on Form 25 to delist our common units and terminate the registration of our common units under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The delisting became effective on May 9, 2016. Our common units trade on the OTCQB Marketplace under the ticker symbol “RHNO.”
 
We are managed by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. Our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our wholly owned subsidiary, Rhino Energy LLC, and its subsidiaries.
 
Coal Operations
 
Mining and Leasing Operations
 
As of December 31, 2019, we operated three mining complexes located in Central Appalachia (Tug River, Rob Fork and Jewell Valley). In addition during 2019, we operated one mining complex located in Northern Appalachia (Hopedale). In the Western Bituminous region, we operated one mining complex located in Emery and Carbon Counties, Utah (Castle Valley). During the year, we also operated a mining complex in the Illinois Basin, our Riveredge mine at our Pennyrile mining complex. (Please read above for additional information on the disposition of the Pennyrile mining complex).
 
We define a mining complex as a central location for processing raw coal and loading coal into railroad cars, barges or trucks for shipment to customers. These mining complexes include four active preparation plants and/or loadouts, each of which receive, blend, process and ship coal that is produced from one or more of our active surface and underground mines. All of the preparation plants are modern plants that have both coarse and fine coal cleaning circuits.
 
The following map shows the location of our coal mining and leasing operations as of December 31, 2019 (Note: the McClane Canyon mine in Colorado was permanently idled at December 31, 2013):

Our surface mines include area mining and contour mining. These operations use truck and wheel loader equipment fleets along with large production tractors and shovels. Our underground mines utilize the room and pillar mining method. These operations generally consist of one or more single or dual continuous miner sections which are made up of the continuous miner, shuttle cars, roof bolters, feeder and other support equipment. We currently own most of the equipment utilized in our mining operations. We employ preventive maintenance and rebuild programs to ensure that our equipment is modern and well-maintained. The rebuild programs are performed either by an on-site shop or by third-party manufacturers.

Central Appalachia. As of December 31, 2019, we operated three mining complexes located in Central Appalachia consisting of three active underground mines and three surface mines. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the mines at our Tug River and Rob Fork mining complexes produced an aggregate of approximately 1.1 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 0.5 million tons of metallurgical coal. Two of the underground mines at our Jewell Valley mining complex produced approximately 15,000 tons of mid-vol metallurgical coal during the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
Tug River Mining Complex. Our Tug River mining complex is located in Kentucky and West Virginia bordering the Tug River. This complex produces coal from two company-operated surface mines, which includes one high-wall mining unit. Coal production from these operations is delivered to the Tug Fork preparation plant for processing and then transported by truck to the Jamboree rail loadout for blending and shipping. Coal suitable for direct-ship to customers is delivered by truck directly to the Jamboree rail loadout from the mine sites. The Tug Fork plant is a modern, 350 tons per hour preparation plant utilizing heavy media circuitry that is capable of cleaning coarse and fine coal size fractions. The Jamboree loadout is located on the Norfolk Southern Railroad and is a modern unit train, batch weigh loadout. This mining complex produced approximately 0.9 million tons of steam coal and approximately 0.3 million tons of metallurgical coal for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
Rob Fork Mining Complex. Our Rob Fork mining complex is located in eastern Kentucky and produces coal from one company-operated surface mine and one company-operated underground mine. The Rob Fork mining complex is located on the CSX Railroad and consists of a modern preparation plant utilizing heavy media circuitry that is capable of cleaning coarse and fine coal size fractions and a unit train loadout with batch weighing equipment. The mining complex has significant blending capabilities allowing the blending of raw coals with washed coals to meet a wide variety of customers’ needs. The Rob Fork mining complex produced approximately 0.1 million tons of steam coal and 0.3 million tons of metallurgical coal for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We also have an estimated 111.1 million of proven and probable reserves in the Taylorville Field area in the Illinois Basin that remains undeveloped.
 
Other Non-Mining Operations
 
In addition to our mining operations, we operate various subsidiaries which provide auxiliary services for our coal mining operations. Rhino Services is responsible for mine-related construction, site and roadway maintenance and post-mining reclamation. Through Rhino Services, we plan and monitor each phase of our mining projects as well as the post-mining reclamation efforts. We also perform the majority of our drilling and blasting activities at our company-operated surface mines in-house rather than contracting to a third party.
Other Natural Resource Assets
 
Oil and Natural Gas
 
In addition to our coal operations, we have invested in oil and natural gas assets and operations.
 
In December 2012, we made an initial investment in a new joint venture, Muskie Proppant LLC (“Muskie”), with affiliates of Wexford Capital. In November 2014, we contributed our investment interest in Muskie to Mammoth Energy Partners LP (“Mammoth”) in return for a limited partner interest in Mammoth. In October 2016, we contributed our limited partner interests in Mammoth to Mammoth, Inc. in exchange for 234,300 shares of common stock of Mammoth, Inc.
 
In September 2014, we made an initial investment of $5.0 million in a new joint venture, Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC (“Sturgeon”), with affiliates of Wexford Capital and Gulfport Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: GPOR) (“Gulfport”). In June 2017, we contributed our limited partner interests in Sturgeon to Mammoth Inc. in exchange for 336,447 shares of common stock of Mammoth Inc. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 104,100 shares of Mammoth Inc. Our remaining shares of Mammoth Inc. were sold during 2019.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we recorded our investment in Mammoth Inc. as a current asset, which was classified as available-for-sale. We have included our investment in Mammoth Inc. in the Other category for segment reporting purposes for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Coal Customers
 
General
 
Our primary customers for our steam coal are electric utilities and industrial consumers, and the metallurgical coal we produce is sold primarily to domestic and international steel producers and coal brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 82.0% of our coal sales tons consisted of steam coal and approximately 18.0% consisted of metallurgical coal. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 45.0% of our coal sales tons that we produced were sold to electric utilities. The majority of our electric utility customers purchase coal for terms of one to three years, but we also supply coal on a spot basis for some of our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 73.2% of our total coal revenues from sales to our ten largest customers, with affiliates of our top three customers accounting for approximately 38.3% of our coal revenues for that period. The above percentages include coal sales from discontinued operations related to our Pennyrile operation.

Coal Supply Contracts
 
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 82% and 64%, respectively, of our aggregate coal tons sold were sold through supply contracts. We expect to continue selling a significant portion of our coal under supply contracts. As of December 31, 2019, we had commitments under supply contracts to deliver annually scheduled base quantities as follows:

Year | Tons | | Number of customers
-----+------+----------------+--------------------
 | | (in thousands) | | 
2020 | | 1,734 | | 12
2021 | | 400 | | 3 
2022 | | 250 | | 3 

 
Some of the contracts have sales price adjustment provisions, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, based on a variety of factors and indices.
 
Quality and volumes for the coal are stipulated in coal supply contracts, and in some instances buyers have the option to vary annual or monthly volumes. Most of our coal supply contracts contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat content, sulfur, ash, hardness and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or termination of the contracts. Some of our contracts specify approved locations from which coal may be sourced. Some of our contracts set out mechanisms for temporary reductions or delays in coal volumes in the event of a force majeure, including events such as strikes, adverse mining conditions, mine closures, or serious transportation problems that affect us or unanticipated plant outages that may affect the buyers.
 
The terms of our coal supply contracts result from competitive bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with customers. As a result, the terms of these contracts, including price adjustment features, price re-opener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, future regulatory changes, extension options, force majeure, termination and assignment provisions, vary significantly by customer.
 
Transportation
 
We ship coal to our customers by rail, truck or barge. A significant portion of our coal is transported to customers by either the CSX Railroad or the Norfolk Southern Railroad in eastern Kentucky and by the Ohio Central Railroad or the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad in Ohio. We use third-party trucking to transport coal to our customers in Utah. In addition, coal from certain Central Appalachia mines is located within economical trucking distance to the Big Sandy River and can be transported by barge. It is customary for customers to pay the transportation costs to their location.
 
We believe that we have good relationships with rail carriers, barge companies and truck companies due, in part, to our modern coal-loading facilities at our loadouts and the working relationships and experience of our transportation and distribution employees.
 
Suppliers
 
Principal supplies used in our business include diesel fuel, explosives, maintenance and repair parts and services, roof control and support items, tires, conveyance structures, ventilation supplies and lubricants. We use third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs and construction.
 
We have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration, for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods and to support the mining and coal preparation plants. We are not dependent on any one supplier in any region. We promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with those suppliers whose focus is on lowering our costs. We seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise.

Competition
 
The coal industry is highly competitive. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal producing regions of the United States and we compete with many of these producers. Our main competitors include Alliance Resource Partners LP, Contura Energy, Inc., Arch Coal, Inc., Blackhawk Mining, LLC, Murray Energy Corporation, Foresight Energy LP, and Wolverine Fuels, LLC.
 
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and the reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and international consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by factors beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, availability, quality and price of competing sources of fuel such as natural gas, oil and nuclear, and alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric power, solar power and wind power.
 
Regulation and Laws
 
Our operations are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters such as:
 

● | employee health and safety; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | governmental approvals and other authorizations such as mine permits, as well as other licensing requirements; 
● | air quality standards; 
● | water quality standards; 
● | storage, treatment, use and disposal of petroleum products and other hazardous substances; 
● | plant and wildlife protection; 
● | reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed; 
● | the discharge of materials into the environment, including waterways or wetlands; 
● | storage and handling of explosives; 
● | wetlands protection; 
● | surface subsidence from underground mining; 
● | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability; and 
● | legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners. 

 
In addition, many of our customers are subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impacts associated with the combustion or other use of coal, which could affect demand for our coal. The possibility exists that new laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may be adopted that may have a significant impact on our mining operations or our customers’ ability to use coal. Moreover, environmental citizen groups frequently challenge coal mining, terminal construction, and other related projects.

We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time. Violations, including violations of any permit or approval, can result in substantial civil and in severe cases, criminal fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits. None of the violations to date have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
 
While it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Nonetheless, capital expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years. We have accrued for the present value of estimated cost of reclamation and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. The accruals for reclamation and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the costs and timing of reclamation and mine closing procedures. Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if we later determined these accruals to be insufficient. Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for all domestic coal producers.
 
Mining Permits and Approvals
 
Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for coal mining operations. When we apply for these permits and approvals, we are often required to assess the effect or impact that any proposed production of coal may have upon the environment. The permit application requirements may be costly and time consuming, and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations in certain locations. In addition, these permits and approvals can result in the imposition of numerous restrictions on the time, place and manner in which coal mining operations are conducted. Future laws and regulations may emphasize more heavily the protection of the environment and, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated. Laws and regulations, as well as future interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs, or delays, interruptions or terminations of operations, the extent of any of which cannot be predicted. In addition, the permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years, and can be subject to judicial challenge, including by the public. Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all. We may experience difficulty and/or delay in obtaining mining permits in the future.
 
Regulations provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations which have outstanding environmental violations. Although, like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.
 
Before commencing mining on a particular property, we must obtain mining permits and approvals by state regulatory authorities of a reclamation plan for restoring, upon the completion of mining, the mined property to its approximate prior condition, productive use or other permitted condition.
 
Mine Health and Safety Laws
 
Stringent safety and health standards have been in effect since the adoption of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”), and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards and imposed comprehensive safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations and other matters. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) monitors compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the states where we operate also have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal industry are complex, rigorous and comprehensive, and have a significant effect on our operating costs.

The Mine Act is a strict liability statute that requires mandatory inspections of surface and underground coal mines and requires the issuance of enforcement action when it is believed that a standard has been violated. A penalty is required to be imposed for each cited violation. Negligence and gravity assessments result in a cumulative enforcement scheme that may result in the issuance of an order requiring the immediate withdrawal of miners from the mine or shutting down a mine or any section of a mine or any piece of mine equipment. The Mine Act contains criminal liability provisions. For example, criminal liability may be imposed for corporate operators who knowingly or willfully authorize, order or carry out violations. The Mine Act also provides that civil and criminal penalties may be assessed against individual agents, officers and directors who knowingly authorize, order or carry out violations.
 
We have developed a health and safety management system that, among other things, includes training regarding worker health and safety requirements including those arising under federal and state laws that apply to our mines. In addition, our health and safety management system tracks the performance of each operational facility in meeting the requirements of safety laws and company safety policies. As an example of the resources we allocate to health and safety matters, our safety management system includes a company-wide safety director and local safety directors who oversee safety and compliance at operations on a day-to-day basis. We continually monitor the performance of our safety management system and from time-to-time modify that system to address findings or reflect new requirements or for other reasons. We have even integrated safety matters into our compensation and retention decisions. For instance, our bonus program includes a meaningful evaluation of each eligible employee’s role in complying with, fostering and furthering our safety policies.
 
We evaluate a variety of safety-related metrics to assess the adequacy and performance of our safety management system. For example, we monitor and track performance in areas such as “accidents, reportable accidents, lost time accidents and the lost-time accident frequency rate” and a number of others. Each of these metrics provides insights and perspectives into various aspects of our safety systems and performance at particular locations or mines generally and, among other things, can indicate where improvements are needed or further evaluation is warranted with regard to the system or its implementation. An important part of this evaluation is to assess our performance relative to certain national benchmarks.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019 our average MSHA violations per inspection day was 0.44 as compared to the most recent national average of 0.61 violations per inspection day for coal mining activity as reported by MSHA, or 27.87% below this national average.
 
Mining accidents in the last several years in West Virginia, Kentucky and Utah have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national levels that have resulted in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining operations, particularly underground mining operations. For example, in 2014, MSHA adopted a final rule to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust. The rule had a phased implementation schedule. The second phase of the rule went into effect in February 2016, and requires increased sampling frequency and the use of continuous personal dust monitors. In August 2016, the third and final phase of the rule became effective, reducing the overall respirable dust standard in coal mines from 2.0 to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air. Additionally, in September 2015, MSHA issued a proposed rule requiring the installation of proximity detection systems on coal hauling machines and scoops. Proximity detection is a technology that uses electronic sensors to detect motion and the distance between a miner and a machine. These systems provide audible and visual warnings, and automatically stop moving machines when miners are in the machines’ path. These and other new safety rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.
 
In addition, more stringent mine safety laws and regulations promulgated by the states and the federal government have included increased sanctions for non-compliance. For example, in 2006, the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, or MINER Act, was enacted. The MINER Act significantly amended the Mine Act, requiring improvements in mine safety practices, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection and enforcement activities. Since passage of the MINER Act in 2006, enforcement scrutiny has increased, including more inspection hours at mine sites, increased numbers of inspections and increased issuance of the number and the severity of enforcement actions and related penalties. For example, in July 2014, MSHA proposed a rule that revises its civil penalty assessment provisions and how regulators should approach calculating penalties, which, in some instances, could result in increased civil penalty assessments for medium and larger mine operators and contractors by 300 to 1,000 percent. MSHA proposed some revisions to the original proposed rule in February 2015, but, to date, has not taken any further action. Other states have proposed or passed similar bills, resolutions or regulations addressing enhanced mine safety practices and increased fines and penalties. Moreover, workplace accidents, such as the April 5, 2010, Upper Big Branch Mine incident, have resulted in more inspection hours at mine sites, increased number of inspections and increased issuance of the number and severity of enforcement actions and the passage of new laws and regulations. These trends are likely to continue.

In 2013, MSHA began implementing its Pattern of Violation (“POV”) regulations under the Mine Act. Under this regulation, MSHA eliminated the ninety (90) day window to take corrective action and engage in mitigation efforts for mine operators who met certain initial POV screening criteria. Additionally, MSHA will make POV determinations based upon enforcement actions as issued, rather than enforcement actions that have been rendered final following the opportunity for administrative or judicial review. After a mine operator has been placed on POV status, MSHA will thereafter issue an order withdrawing miners from the area affected by any enforcement action designated by MSHA as posing a significant and substantial, or S&S, hazard to the health and/or safety of miners. Further, once designated as a POV mine, a mine operator can be removed from POV status only upon: (1) a complete inspection of the entire mine with no S&S enforcement actions issued by MSHA; or (2) no POV-related withdrawal orders being issued by MSHA within ninety (90) days of the mine operator being placed on POV status. Although it remains to be seen how these new regulations will ultimately affect production at our mines, they are consistent with the trend of more stringent enforcement.
 
From time to time, certain portions of individual mines have been required to suspend or shut down operations temporarily in order to address a compliance requirement or because of an accident. For instance, MSHA issues orders pursuant to Section 103(k) that, among other things, call for operations in the area of the mine at issue to suspend operations until compliance is restored. Likewise, if an accident occurs within a mine, the MSHA requirements call for all operations in that area to be suspended until the circumstance leading to the accident has been resolved. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (as in earlier years), we received such orders from government agencies and have experienced accidents within our mines requiring the suspension or shutdown of operations in those particular areas until the circumstances leading to the accident have been resolved. While the violations or other circumstances that caused such an accident were being addressed, other areas of the mine could and did remain operational. These circumstances did not require us to suspend operations on a mine-wide level or otherwise entail material financial or operational consequences for us. Any suspension of operations at any one of our locations that may occur in the future may have material financial or operational consequences for us.
 
It is our practice to contest notices of violations in cases in which we believe we have a good faith defense to the alleged violation or the proposed penalty and/or other legitimate grounds to challenge the alleged violation or the proposed penalty. We exercise substantial efforts toward achieving compliance at our mines. For example, we have further increased our focus with regard to health and safety at all of our mines. These efforts include hiring additional skilled personnel, providing training programs, hosting quarterly safety meetings with MSHA personnel and making capital expenditures in consultation with MSHA aimed at increasing mine safety. We believe that these efforts have contributed, and continue to contribute, positively to safety and compliance at our mines. In “Part 1, Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure” and in Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provide additional details on how we monitor safety performance and MSHA compliance, as well as provide the mine safety disclosures required pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
 
Black Lung Laws
 
Under the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, coal mine operators must make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease, some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease, and to fund a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the industry prior to January 1, 1970. To help fund these benefits, a tax is levied on production of $1.10 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 4.4% of the applicable sales price (rates effective January 1, 2020). This excise tax does not apply to coal that is exported outside of the United States. In 2019, we recorded approximately $1.5 million of expense related to this excise tax, which includes the amount paid for our Pennyrile operation that was discontinued in the third quarter of 2019.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes significant changes to the federal black lung program including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. We may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims that are covered through either insurance policies or state programs.

Workers’ Compensation
 
We are required to compensate employees for work-related injuries under various state workers’ compensation laws. The states in which we operate consider changes in workers’ compensation laws from time to time. Our costs will vary based on the number of accidents that occur at our mines and other facilities, and our costs of addressing these claims. We are insured under the Ohio State Workers Compensation Program for our operations in Ohio. Our remaining operations, including Central Appalachia and the Western Bituminous region, are insured through Rockwood Casualty Insurance Company.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”)
 
SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining, including the surface effects of underground coal mining. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of mining activities. In conjunction with mining the property, we reclaim and restore the mined areas by grading, shaping and preparing the soil for seeding. Upon completion of mining, reclamation generally is completed by seeding with grasses or planting trees for a variety of uses, as specified in the approved reclamation plan. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
 
SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans. The act requires that we restore the surface to approximate the original contours as soon as practicable upon the completion of surface mining operations. The mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of these reclamation obligations. Mine operators can also be responsible for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of long-wall mining and possibly other mining operations. In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a tax on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed prior to SMCRA’s adoption in 1977. The maximum tax for the period from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, has been decreased to 28 cents per ton on surface mined coal and 12 cents per ton on underground mined coal. However, this fee is subject to change. Should this fee be increased in the future, given the market for coal, it is unlikely that coal mining companies would be able to recover all of these fees from their customers. As of December 31, 2019, we had accrued approximately $20.6 million for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation of orphaned mine sites and abandoned mine drainage control on a statewide basis.
 
After a mine application is submitted, public notice or advertisement of the proposed permit action is required, which is followed by a public comment period. It is not uncommon for a SMCRA mine permit application to take over two years to prepare and review, depending on the size and complexity of the mine, and another two years or even longer for the permit to be issued. The variability in time frame required to prepare the application and issue the permit can be attributed primarily to the various regulatory authorities’ discretion in the handling of comments and objections relating to the project received from the general public and other agencies. Also, it is not uncommon for a permit to be delayed as a result of judicial challenges related to the specific permit or another related company’s permit.
 
Federal laws and regulations also provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed, refused or revoked if owners of specific percentages of ownership interests or controllers (i.e., officers and directors or other entities) of the applicant have, or are affiliated with another entity that has outstanding violations of SMCRA or state or tribal programs authorized by SMCRA. This condition is often referred to as being “permit blocked” under the federal Applicant Violator Systems, or AVS. Thus, non-compliance with SMCRA can provide the basis to deny the issuance of new mining permits or modifications of existing mining permits, although we know of no basis by which we would be (and we are not now) permit-blocked.

Surety Bonds
 
Federal and state laws require a mine operator to secure the performance of its reclamation obligations required under SMCRA through the use of surety bonds or other approved forms of performance security to cover the costs the state would incur if the mine operator were unable to fulfill its obligations. It has become increasingly difficult for mining companies to secure new surety bonds without the posting of partial collateral. In August 2016, the OSMRE issued a Policy Advisory discouraging state regulatory authorities from approving self-bonding arrangements. The Policy Advisory indicated that the OSM would begin more closely reviewing instances in which states accept self-bonds for mining operations. In the same month, the OSM also announced that it was beginning the rulemaking process to strengthen regulations on self-bonding. In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bond have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $41.6 million in surety bonds outstanding to secure the performance of our reclamation obligations. Of the $41.6 million, approximately $0.4 million relates to surety bonds for Deane Mining, LLC, which have not been transferred or replaced by the buyer of Deane Mining LLC as was agreed to by the parties as part of the transaction. We can provide no assurances that a surety company will underwrite the surety bonds of the purchaser of Deane Mining LLC, nor are we aware of the actual amount of reclamation at any given time. Further, if there was a claim under these surety bonds prior to the transfer or replacement of such bonds by the buyer of Deane Mining, LLC, we may be responsible to the surety company for any amounts it pays in respect of such claim. While the buyer is required to indemnify us for damages, including reclamation liabilities, pursuant to the agreements governing the sales of this entity, we may not be successful in obtaining any indemnity or any amounts received may be inadequate.
 
Air Emissions
 
The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations, which regulate emissions into the air, affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, on sources that emit various hazardous and non-hazardous air pollutants. The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other industrial consumers of coal, including air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates, mercury and other compounds. There have been a series of recent federal rulemakings from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, which are focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, in June 2015, the United States Supreme Court decided Michigan v. the EPA, which held that the EPA should have considered the compliance costs associated with its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, in deciding to regulate power plants under Section 112(n)(1) of the Clean Air Act. The Court did not vacate the MATS rule, and MATS has remained in place. In April 2016, EPA published its final supplemental finding that it is “appropriate and necessary” to regulate coal and oil-fired units under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. That finding was challenged in court, but the rule remained in effect. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit agreed to EPA’s request to delay proceedings while the EPA reviewed the supplemental finding to determine whether it should be maintained, modified, or otherwise reconsidered. In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed revised Supplemental Cost Finding for the MATS rule proposing to determine that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate Hazardous Air Pollutant (“HAP”) emissions from power plants under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA did not propose, however, to rescind or repeal the HAP emission standards and other requirements of the MATS rule, which would remain in place under the proposal. Installation of additional emissions control technology and additional measures required under laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans, or SIPs, could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.

In addition to the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations discussed below, air emission control programs that affect our operations, directly or indirectly, through impacts to coal-fired utilities and other manufacturing plants, include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | The EPA’s Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility’s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA’s Acid Rain Program by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or “scrubbers,” or by reducing electricity generating levels. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”), which requires the District of Columbia and 27 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. In September 2016, EPA finalized the CSAPR Rule Update for the 2008 ozone national air quality standards (“NAAQS”). The rule aims to reduce summertime NOx emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States. 
● | The EPA has adopted new, more stringent NAAQS for ozone, fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards. For example, in June 2010, the EPA issued a final rule setting forth a more stringent primary NAAQS applicable to sulfur dioxide. The rule also modifies the monitoring increment for the sulfur dioxide standard, establishing a 1-hour standard, and expands the sulfur dioxide monitoring network. Initial non-attainment determinations related to the 2010 sulfur dioxide rule were published in August 2013 with an effective date in October 2013. States with non-attainment areas had to submit their SIP revisions in April 2015, which must meet the modified standard by summer 2017. For all other areas, states will be required to submit “maintenance” SIPs. EPA finalized its PM2.5 NAAQS designations in December 2014. Individual states must now identify the sources of PM2.5 emissions and develop emission reduction plans, which may be state-specific or regional in scope. Nonattainment areas must meet the revised standard no later than 2021. More recently, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Significant additional emissions control expenditures will likely be required at coal-fired power plants and coke plants to meet the new standards. The EPA completed area designations for the 2015 ozone standards in July 2018. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and customers could be affected when the standards are implemented by the applicable states. Moreover, we could face adverse impacts on our business to the extent that these and any other new rules affecting coal-fired power plants result in reduced demand for coal. 


● | In June 2005, the EPA amended its regional haze program to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. Affected states were required to develop SIPs by December 2007 that, among other things, were to identify facilities that would have to reduce emissions and comply with stricter emission limitations. The vast majority of states failed to submit their plans by the December 2017 deadline. The EPA ultimately agreed in a consent decree with environmental groups to impose regional haze federal implementation plans or to take action on regional haze SIPs before the agency for 42 states and the District of Columbia. The EPA has completed those actions for all but several states in its first planning period (2008-2010). The continued implementation of this program has restricted and may continue to restrict construction of new coal-fired power plants where emissions are projected to reduce visibility in protected areas and may require certain existing coal-fired power plants to install emissions control equipment to reduce haze-causing emissions such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. Consequently, demand for our steam coal could be affected. However, in January 2018 EPA announced that it was revisiting the 2017 Regional Haze Rule revisions, and announced an intent to commence a new rulemaking. In September 2018, EPA released the Regional Haze Reform Roadmap directing EPA staff to take certain actions to ensure adequate support for states to enable timely and effective implementation of the regional haze program and announcing EPA’s intent to issue new guidance and continue exploring further regulatory EPA by July 2021, to address visibility impairment for the second implementation period, which ends in 2028.

Climate Change
 
One by-product of burning coal is carbon dioxide or CO2, which EPA considers a GHG and a major source of concern with respect to climate change and global warming.
 
On the international level, the United States was one of almost 200 nations that agreed on December 12, 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own GHG emission targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emission targets; however, the agreement does not set binding GHG emission reduction targets. The Paris climate agreement entered into force in November 2016; however, in August 2017 the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the U.S. to withdraw from the agreement, with the earliest possible effective date of withdrawal being November 4, 2020. Despite the planned withdrawal, certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement. These commitments could further reduce demand and prices for coal.
 
At the Federal level, EPA has taken a number of steps to regulate GHG emissions. For example, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) rules setting carbon pollution standards for power plants. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the CPP in February 2016. In June 2019, EPA finalized the proposed Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) Rule to replace the CPP, provide states with authority to regulate GHGs from coal-fired power plants, and establish heat rate improvements as the best system of emissions reduction. The ACE rule has been challenged in court and the final outcome of that litigation is uncertain. If the ACE Rule results in state plans to significantly reduce the level of GHG emissions from electric utility generating units, or if EPA implements more stringent regulations in the future, demand for coal will likely decrease. The EPA also issued a final rule for new coal-fired power plants in August 2015, which essentially set performance standards for coal-fired power plants that requires partial carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”). In December 2018, EPA proposed a rule amending its prior determination that carbon capture and sequestration is the best system of emission reduction. However, if that rule is not finalized, or if other legal actions require fossil fuel-fired power plants to use of carbon capture and storage technology, the demand for coal may decrease. In addition, passage of any comprehensive federal climate change and energy legislation could impact the demand for coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by North American electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.
 
Many states and regions have adopted greenhouse gas initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of greenhouse gases by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, ten northeastern states formed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (“RGGI”) aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. RGGI imposes a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide on all fossil-fuel fired electric generating facilities that are 25 MW or larger and allows for trades of carbon dioxide emissions in the participating states. The RGGI carbon dioxide trading program began with auctions for carbon dioxide allowances in September 2008. New Jersey rejoined RGGI in 2019 after leaving in 2011 and several additional northeastern states and Canadian provinces have joined as participants or observers since its inception. In 2014, RGGI states implemented a new CO2 cap of 91 million short tons, which declined 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020. It is likely that these regional efforts will continue.
 
The Western Regional Climate Action Initiative (“WCI”) seeks to identify, evaluate and implement collective and cooperative methods of reducing greenhouse gases in the subject regions to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. The participants consist of California and two Canadian provinces: Nova Scotia and Quebec. Additionally, in October 2019, California and Quebec entered into a cap-and-trade agreement. The Department of Justice then filed suit against California over its agreement with Quebec. That litigation is ongoing. If the agreement is upheld, and the cap-and-trade agreement stays in place, demand for coal-fired power may decrease.
 
Many coal-fired plants have already closed or announced plans to close and proposed new construction projects have also come under additional scrutiny with respect to GHG emissions. There have been an increasing number of protests and challenges to the permitting of new coal-fired power plants by environmental organizations and state regulators due to concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions. Other state regulatory authorities have also rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide. In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fired power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board. In addition, over 30 states have adopted mandatory “renewable portfolio standards,” which require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date. These standards range generally from 10% to 30%, over time periods that generally extend from the present until between 2020 and 2030. Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area. To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers, they may reduce the demand for coal-fired power, and may affect long-term demand for our coal.

If mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions are imposed, the ability to capture and store large volumes of carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants may be a key mitigation technology to achieve emissions reductions while meeting projected energy demands. A number of legislative and regulatory initiatives to encourage the development and use of carbon capture and storage technology have been proposed or enacted. For example, in October 2015, the EPA released a rule that established, for the first time, new source performance standards under the federal Clean Air Act for CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating power plants. The EPA has designated partial carbon capture and sequestration as the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units at power plants to employ to meet the standard. In December 2018, EPA proposed a rule amending its prior determination that carbon capture and sequestration is the best system of emission reduction. However, if that rule is not finalized, or if other legal actions require fossil fuel-fired power plants to use carbon capture and storage technology, the demand for coal may decrease. However, widespread cost-effective deployment of CCS will occur only if the technology is commercially available at economically competitive prices and supportive national policy frameworks are in place.
 
There have also been attempts to encourage greater regulation of coalbed methane because methane has a greater GHG effect than CO2. Methane from coal mines can give rise to safety concerns, and may require that various measures be taken to mitigate those risks. If new laws or regulations were introduced to reduce coalbed methane emissions, those rules could adversely affect our costs of operations.
 
These and other current or future global climate change laws, regulations, court orders or other legally enforceable mechanisms, or related public perceptions regarding climate change, are expected to require additional controls on coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers and may cause some users of coal to further switch from coal to alternative sources of fuel, thereby depressing demand and pricing for coal.
 
Finally, some scientists have warned that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If these warnings are correct, and if any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our customers operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
 
Clean Water Act
 
The Federal Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill material, into waters of the U.S. The CWA establishes in-stream water quality and treatment standards for wastewater discharges that are applied to wastewater dischargers through Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits. Regular monitoring, as well as compliance with reporting requirements and performance standards, are preconditions for the issuance and renewal of Section 402 NPDES permits. Individual permits or general permits under Section 404 of the CWA are required to discharge dredged or fill materials into waters of the U.S. including wetlands, streams, and other areas meeting the regulatory definition. Expansion of EPA jurisdiction over these areas has the potential to adversely impact our operations. Legal uncertainty exists surrounding the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the Clean Water Act. In 2015, EPA issued a rule to expand the definition for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands. That rule was challenged, and courts stayed the rule’s implementation in many states. In October 2019, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) repealed the 2015 rule. Challenges to the 2019 repeal have been filed. Should the 2019 repeal be vacated and the 2015 rule enforced in the states in which we operate, or should a different rule expanding the definition of waters of the United States be finalized, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.

Our surface coal mining and preparation plant operations typically require such permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds, stream impoundments, and valley fills. The EPA, or a state that has been delegated such authority by the EPA, issues NPDES permits for the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) issues dredge and fill permits under Section 404 of the CWA. Where Section 402 NPDES permitting authority has been delegated to a state, the EPA retains a limited oversight role. The CWA also gives the EPA an oversight role in the Section 404 permitting program, including drafting substantive rules governing permit issuance by the Corps, providing comments on proposed permits, and, in some cases, exercising the authority to delay or pre-empt Corps issuance of a Section 404 permit. The EPA has recently asserted these authorities more forcefully to question, delay, and prevent issuance of some Section 402 and 404 permits for surface coal mining in Appalachia. Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits.
 
For instance, even though the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the State of West Virginia have been delegated the authority to issue NPDES permits for coal mines in those states, the EPA is taking a more active role in its review of NPDES permit applications for coal mining operations in Appalachia. The EPA issued final guidance on July 21, 2011 that encouraged EPA Regions 3, 4 and 5 to object to the issuance of state program NPDES permits where the Region does not believe that the proposed permit satisfies the requirements of the CWA and with regard to state issued general Section 404 permits, support the previously drafted Enhanced Coordination Process (“ECP”) among the EPA, the Corps, and the U.S. Department of the Interior for issuing Section 404 permits, whereby the EPA undertook a greater level of review of certain Section 404 permits than it had previously undertaken. The D.C. Circuit upheld EPA’s use of the ECP in July 2014. Future application of the ECP, such as may be enacted following notice and comment rulemaking, would have the potential to delay issuance of permits for surface coal mines, or to change the conditions or restrictions imposed in those permits.
 
The EPA also has statutory “veto” power under Section 404(c) to effectively revoke a previously issued Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an “unacceptable adverse effect.” The Court previously upheld the EPA’s ability to exercise this authority. Any future use of the EPA’s Section 404 “veto” power could create uncertainty with regard to our continued use of their current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our revenues.
 
The Corps is authorized to issue general “nationwide” permits for specific categories of activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse environmental effects. We may no longer seek general permits under Nationwide Permit 21 (“NWP 21”) because in February 2012, the Corps reinstated the use of NWP 21, but limited application of NWP 21 authorizations to discharges with impacts not greater than a half-acre of water, including no more than 300 linear feet of streambed, and disallowed the use of NWP 21 for valley fills. This limitation remains in place in the NWP 21 issued in January of 2017. If the 2017 NWP 21 cannot be used for any of our proposed surface coal mining projects, we will have to obtain individual permits from the Corps subject to the additional EPA measures discussed below with the uncertainties and delays attendant to that process.
 
We currently have a number of Section 404 permit applications pending with the Corps. Not all of these permit applications seek approval for valley fills or other obvious “fills”; some relate to other activities, such as mining through streams and the associated post-mining reconstruction efforts. We sought to prepare all pending permit applications consistent with the requirements of the Section 404 program. Our five year plan of mining operations does not rely on the issuance of these pending permit applications. However, the Section 404 permitting requirements are complex, and regulatory scrutiny of these applications, particularly in Appalachia, has increased such that our applications may not be granted or, alternatively, the Corps may require material changes to our proposed operations before it grants permits. While we will continue to pursue the issuance of these permits in the ordinary course of our operations, to the extent that the permitting process creates significant delay or limits our ability to pursue certain reserves beyond our current five year plan, our revenues may be negatively affected.
 
Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired water body can receive and still meet state water quality standards, and to allocate pollutant loads among the point- and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body. Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an anti-degradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDLs and load allocations or any changes to anti-degradation policies for streams near our coal mines could limit our ability to obtain NPDES permits, require more costly water treatment, and adversely affect our coal production.

Hazardous Substances and Wastes
 
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Some products used by coal companies in operations generate waste containing hazardous substances. We are not aware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
 
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws regulating hazardous waste affect coal mining operations by imposing requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous wastes. In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material. While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.
 
In December 2014, EPA finalized regulations that address the management of coal ash as a non-hazardous solid waste under Subtitle D. The rules impose engineering, structural and siting standards on surface impoundments and landfills that hold coal combustion wastes and mandate regular inspections. The rule also requires fugitive dust controls and imposes various monitoring, cleanup, and closure requirements. The rule leaves intact the Bevill exemption for beneficial uses of CCR, though it defers a final Bevill regulatory determination with respect to CCR that is disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments. However, the D.C. Circuit vacated portions of the rule other than the Subtitle D decision. Other portions of the rule are also subject to legal uncertainty due to ongoing regulatory and judicial processes. Additionally, in December 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides for the establishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of coal combustion residuals and authorizes states to incorporate EPA’s final rule for coal combustion residuals or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. The costs of complying with these new requirements may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and could potentially increase our customers’ operating costs, thereby reducing their ability to purchase coal as a result. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of CCR, including coal ash, can lead to material liability to our customers under RCRA or other federal or state laws and potentially reduce the demand for coal.
 
Endangered Species Act
 
The federal Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits and may include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats. A number of species indigenous to our properties are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Based on the species that have been identified to date and the current application of applicable laws and regulations, however, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal from our properties in accordance with current mining plans.

Use of Explosives
 
We use explosives in connection with our surface mining activities. The Federal Safe Explosives Act (“SEA”) applies to all users of explosives. Knowing or willful violations of the SEA may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. In addition, violations of SEA may result in revocation of user permits and seizure or forfeiture of explosive materials.
 
The storage of explosives is also subject to regulatory requirements. For example, pursuant to a rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2007, facilities in possession of chemicals of interest (including ammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels) are required to complete a screening review in order to help determine whether there is a high level of security risk, such that a security vulnerability assessment and a site security plan will be required. It is possible that our use of explosives in connection with blasting operations may subject us to the Department of Homeland Security’s chemical facility security regulatory program. The costs of compliance with these requirements should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In December 2014, OSM announced its decision to propose a rule that will address all blast generated fumes and toxic gases. OSM has not yet issued a proposed rule to address these blasts. We are unable to predict the impact, if any, of these actions by the OSM, although the actions potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with our blasting operations.
 
Other Environmental and Mine Safety Laws
 
We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state and local environmental and mine safety laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. These additional laws include, for example, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The costs of compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Federal Power Act – Grid Reliability Proposal
 
Pursuant to a direction from the Secretary of the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking under the Federal Power Act regarding the valuation by regional electric grid system operators of the reliability and resilience attributes of electricity generation. The rulemaking would have required the FERC to impose market rules that would allow certain cost recovery by electricity-generating units that maintain a 90-day fuel supply on-site and that are therefore capable of providing electricity during supply disruptions from emergencies, extreme weather or natural or man-made disasters. Many coal-fired electricity generating plants could have qualified under this criteria and the cost recovery could have helped improve the economics of their operations. However, in January 2018, the FERC terminated the proposed rulemaking, finding that it failed to satisfy the legal requirements of section 206 of the Federal Power Act, and initiated a new proceeding to further evaluate whether additional FERC action regarding resilience is appropriate. Should a version of this rule be adopted in the future along the lines originally proposed, it could provide economic incentives for companies that produce electricity from coal, among other fuels, which could either slow or stabilize the trend in the shuttering of coal-fired power plants and could thereby maintain certain levels of domestic demand for coal. We cannot speculate on the timing or nature of any subsequent FERC or grid operator actions resulting from the FERC’s decision to further study the issue of grid resiliency.
Employees
 
To carry out our operations, our general partner and our subsidiaries employed 605 full-time employees as of December 31, 2019. None of the employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with these employees and since our inception we have had no history of work stoppages or union organizing campaigns.
