 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “HMH” and the “Company” refer to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, formerly known as HMH Holdings (Delaware), Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. 
 Our Company 
 We are a learning technology company committed to delivering connected solutions that engage learners, empower educators and improve student outcomes. As a leading provider of Kindergarten through 12th grade (“K-12”) core curriculum, supplemental and intervention solutions, and professional learning services, HMH partners with educators and school districts to uncover solutions that unlock students’ potential and extend teachers’ capabilities. HMH estimates that it serves more than 50 million students and three million educators in 150 countries.
 We focus on the K-12 market and, in the United States, we are a market leader. We specialize in comprehensive core curriculum, supplemental and intervention solutions, and we provide ongoing support in professional learning and coaching for educators and administrators. Our offerings are rooted in learning science, and we work with research partners, universities and third-party organizations as we design, build, implement and iterate our offerings to maximize their effectiveness. We are purposeful about innovation, leveraging technology to create engaging and immersive experiences designed to deepen learning experiences for students and to extend teachers’ capabilities so that they can focus on making meaningful connections with their students.
 On May 10, 2021, we completed the sale of all of the assets and liabilities used primarily in the HMH Books & Media segment, our consumer publishing business. The divestiture enables HMH to focus singularly on K–12 education and accelerate growth momentum in digital sales, annual recurring revenue and free cash flow while paying down a significant portion of our debt.
 Our diverse portfolio enables us to help ensure that every student and teacher has the tools needed for success. We are able to build deep partnerships with school districts and leverage the scope of our offerings to provide holistic solutions at scale with the support of our far-reaching sales force and talented field-based specialists and consultants. We provide print, digital, and blended print/digital solutions that are tailored to a district’s needs, goals and technological readiness. 
 On February 21, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Harbor Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Parent”), and Harbor Purchaser Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the “Purchaser”) providing for the acquisition of us by the Parent through a cash tender offer (the “Offer”) by the Purchaser for all of our outstanding shares of common stock, at a price of $21.00 per share of common stock (the “Offer Price”). The Parent and the Purchaser are beneficially owned by The Veritas Capital Fund VII, L.P. The completion of the Offer will be conditioned on at least a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock having been validly tendered into the Offer, receipt of certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. Following the completion of the Offer, the Purchaser will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, pursuant to the procedure provided for under Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, without any additional stockholder approvals. We currently expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2022. If the transaction is completed, it is expected that our common stock will be removed from listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market and from registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding this transaction.
 Market Overview 
 We operate predominantly within the U.S. K-12 education market, which represents over $750 billion of total spending annually. Specifically, we focus on the U.S. market for K-12 instructional materials and services, which we estimate to be approximately $10.0+ billion in size.

The U.S. Education market comprises approximately 13,500 K-12 public school districts, 130,000 public and private schools, 3.7 million teachers and 56.4 million total enrolled students across public, private and charter schools. From Fall 2022 to Fall 2029, total elementary and secondary school enrollment, an important driver of long-term growth in the K-12 Education market, is projected to increase by 0.7% to 56.8 million students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
 The primary sources of funding for public schools in the U.S. are state and local tax collections, with Federal funding historically accounting for approximately 8% of public education spending nationally. Consequently, general or localized economic conditions as well as legislative and political decisions which affect the ability of state and school districts to raise revenue through tax collections can have a significant impact on spending and growth in the K-12 Education market. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on tax revenues and other financial resources in some states, which could adversely affect state and local spending on public schools, although it is expected that federal pandemic relief funding will help to mitigate those impacts. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan Act collectively provided over $263.0 billion in one-time emergency support for education through an Education Stabilization Fund, including $189.5 billion exclusively designated for public K-12 education. Public K-12 education has been, and remains, a high priority for political leaders, historically accounting for more than one-fifth of all state and local government spending.
 
Education policy and curriculum choices have traditionally been local prerogatives in the U.S., but Federal law and policy also play an important role. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (“ESEA”), reauthorized in 2015 by the Every Student Succeeds Act (“ESSA”), requires that states, as a condition to receiving Federal education funds, adopt challenging academic content standards, administer annual student tests aligned to those standards, develop systems of accountability tied to specific goals for student achievement, and take measures to identify and support low performing schools. ESSA gives states more flexibility than they had under prior law, but still requires standards-based, largely assessment-driven accountability with a focus on the achievement of students in all demographic subgroups.
 
Title I, the largest program within ESEA, and other ESEA programs provide targeted funding for specific activities, such as early childhood education, school improvement, dropout prevention, and before- and after-school programs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. Generally, school districts are permitted to spend ESEA funds on instructional materials, including core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services.
 
Academic content standards, which are grade-level expectations for student learning, are established at the state level. States generally review and revise standards in each of the various subject areas every six to eight years, and the revision or adoption of new standards typically gives rise to the need for new instructional materials and services aligned to the new or revised standards. Content standards in English language arts and reading in many states are modeled to varying degrees after Common Core State Standards (“CCSS”) and in science after the Next Generation Science Standards (“NGSS”). Both the CCSS and NGSS are products of state-led collaborations. The promulgation of these model standards has led to greater consistency among states’ content standards but has not eliminated differences and the need for customized state-specific instructional materials.
 Internationally, we export and sell K-12 English language education products to premium private schools that utilize the U.S. curriculum, who are located primarily in Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.  
 Education net sales and billings are derived from Core Solutions and Extensions. Core Solutions products address the core curriculum market with grade-level, educational standards-aligned materials. Extensions products address the markets for supplemental programs, intervention programs, and professional learning.

Market Segments 
 Core Curriculum 
 Our core curriculum offerings cover state-level educational standards within a subject and include a comprehensive offering of teacher and student materials necessary to conduct grade-level instruction throughout the entire school year. Products and services include students’ print and digital resources and a variety of supporting materials such as teacher’s editions, formative assessments, whole group instruction materials, practice aids and ancillary materials. 
 Core curriculum programs traditionally have been the primary resource for classroom instruction in most K-12 academic subjects, and as a result, enrollment trends are a major driver of industry growth. Although economic cycles may affect short-term buying patterns, school enrollments, a driver of growth in the educational content industry, are highly predictable and are expected to trend upward over the longer term. 
 Demand for core curriculum programs is also affected by changes in state curriculum standards, which drive instruction, assessment, and accountability in each state. A significant change in state curriculum standards requires that assessments, teacher training programs, and instructional materials be revised or replaced to align to the new standards, which historically has driven demand for new comprehensive curriculum programs. 
 In the U.S., core curriculum is typically selected and purchased at the school district level and, in some cases, at the individual school level. In 19 states, before districts make their selections, programs are first evaluated at the state level for alignment to state academic standards and other criteria. These states are commonly referred to as “adoption states,” while states that do not have a state level review process are called “open states” or “open territory states.” The National Center for Education Statistics estimated the student population in adoption states represented approximately half of the U.S. public school elementary and secondary school-age population in 2021. In some adoption states, districts are required to select materials from the state-adopted list; in other adoption states, the state list serves as a recommendation, and districts are free to purchase and use any materials they choose, whether or not adopted by the state. Adoption states typically review materials in the various subject areas on a six- to eight-year cycle. School districts in those states tend to follow the state review cycle and replace core programs in the year or years immediately following state adoption. In open territory states, each individual school or school district evaluates and purchases materials independently, typically according to a five- to ten-year cycle. As a result, in individual adoption states, purchases of core instructional materials in a particular subject area tend to be clustered in a window of one to three years, while in individual open territory states they may occur over several years.
 Supplemental 
 Supplemental resources encompass a wide variety of targeted solutions that enrich learning and support student achievement beyond core curriculum. Supplemental resources can be print and/or digital, and can include software, workbooks, test-prep materials, formative assessment, games, and apps. Newer technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with more sophisticated algorithms are also driving the rise in supplemental computer-adaptive practice solutions that can both support teachers who are often time and bandwidth constrained, as well as improve personalization of learning for students. 
 Many teachers augment their core curriculum with supplemental resources for additional practice and personalized instruction around particular areas of need, such as Math, Reading, Writing, or Vocabulary. Supplemental materials are purchased by districts, schools, or individual teachers. These purchases are typically not tied to adoption schedules and leverage funding from local, state and federal sources. We estimate this market to be approximately $2.5 billion per year.
 6


Intervention 
 Intervention solutions are generally purchased by individual schools or districts. Demand for intervention materials is significant and growing in the United States. We estimate this market to be $1.5 billion per year. In the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress assessments conducted in 2019, more than 60 percent of public school students tested below proficiency in most grade levels in both literacy and mathematics. These students are strong candidates for intervention programs that are focused on improving outcomes and ensuring students perform at grade level. As demand for digital content and personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring. 
 Intervention products and services are funded through state and local funding as well as Title I and other federal funding allocations pursuant to the ESEA and IDEA. Title I provides funding to schools and school districts with high concentrations of students from low income families and is often used to purchase intervention products and services. 
 Professional Learning 
 The professional learning market includes consulting and support services to assist individual schools and school districts in raising student achievement, implementing new programs and technology effectively, developing effective teachers, principals and leaders, as well as school and school-district turnaround and improvement solutions. We believe all districts and schools contract for some level of professional services. These services may include support for up-front training, in-classroom coaching, institutes, author workshops, professional learning communities, leadership development, technical support and maintenance, and program management. 
 One important source of funding for professional learning in the K-12 market is Title II, Part A of ESEA, Supporting Effective Instruction. Title II, Part A focuses on the role of the profession in improving student achievement and requires that funds be used to support professional development that is sustained, job-embedded, data-driven, and personalized. There are also significant funding opportunities for professional learning as part of state programs, especially in states that have consolidated program funding and want solutions that are evidence-based. 
 The professional learning market, which is relatively fragmented in the United States, is expected to grow as the transition to digital learning in classrooms increases the need for technology training and implementation support for educators. We currently estimate the professional learning market to be approximately $3.5 billion per year. We believe that the use of interim data, differentiation, teacher content knowledge (in mathematics) and the use of technology in the classroom are the areas in which teachers and leaders are most seeking support. Also, demand for teacher training and professional development opportunities tied to the implementation of new or revised standards at the state level is expected to continue. In addition, the need for new teacher development over the next several years is expected to grow as we continue to see the “greening” of the teaching force, with approximately 345,000 new teachers hired every year along with an approximately 16% annual teacher turnover rate, a trend that may continue or accelerate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

By leveraging our leading position in the U.S. instructional materials market, we aim to engage our customers with solutions addressing the variety of instructional needs across the educational achievement spectrum. We believe that by integrating our solutions on a single platform, which uses a common student dataset, and by developing ongoing connections with the teachers who use our solutions, we will be well positioned to increase and sustain market share and grow our revenues.
 Seasonality 
 Schools typically conduct the majority of their purchases in the second and third quarters of the calendar year in preparation for the beginning of the school year. Thus, over the latest three completed fiscal years, approximately 69% of our consolidated net sales were realized in the second and third quarters. Sales of K-12 instructional materials are also cyclical, with some years offering more sales opportunities than others based on the state adoptions calendar. The amount of funding available at the state level for educational materials also has a significant effect on year-to-year net sales. Although the loss of a single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business, schedules of school adoptions and market acceptance of our products can materially affect year-to-year net sales performance. 
Competition 
 We sell our products in highly competitive markets. In these markets, product quality, innovation and customer service are major differentiating factors between companies. Other factors affecting competition include: (i) competitive pricing, sampling and gratis costs; (ii) digitization and innovative delivery; and (iii) educational effectiveness of the program. In addition to national curriculum publishers, we also compete with a variety of specialized or regional publishers that focus on select disciplines and/or geographic regions in the K-12 market. There are also multiple competitors in the supplemental and assessment markets offering content that school districts increasingly are using as part of their core classroom instructional materials. In addition, school districts in many states are able to spend educational funds on “instructional materials” that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. Our larger competitors include Savvas Learning Co. (formerly Pearson Education, Inc.), McGraw Hill Education, Stride Inc. (formerly K-12 Inc.), Cengage Learning, Inc., Scholastic Corporation, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Curriculum Associates, LLC, Benchmark Education, LLC, Accelerate Learning, Inc., and Amplify Education, Inc. Also competing in our market as a substitute are open educational resources. These resources are free, digital solutions that range from supplemental resources to full Core Solutions programs.

Printing and Binding; Raw Materials 
 We outsource the printing and binding of our products, with approximately 35% of our printing requirements handled by a small group of suppliers. We have procurement agreements that provide volume and scheduling flexibility and price predictability. We have a longstanding relationship with these parties. Approximately 16% of our printed materials (consisting primarily of teacher’s editions and other ancillary components) are printed outside of the U.S. and approximately 84% of our printed materials (including most student editions) are printed within the U.S. Paper is one of our principal raw materials. We purchase our paper primarily through one paper merchant and also directly through suppliers for limited product types. We maintain various agreements that protect against supply availability and unbound price increases. We manage our paper supply concentration by having primary and secondary sources and staying ahead of dramatic market changes. 
Distribution 
 We operate distribution facilities in Geneva, Illinois and Troy, Missouri from which we coordinate our own distribution process. We also utilize select suppliers to assist us with coordinating the distribution process for a limited number of product types. Additionally, some states require us to use in-state textbook depositories for educational materials sold in that particular state. We utilize various delivery firms, such as United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Freight, etc., to facilitate the principally ground transportation of products. 
Human Capital 
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,300 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be good.
Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Following Occupational Safety and Health Administration best practices in our distribution centers, we measure, document and post incident rates for safety transparency; host local employee safety committees at each distribution center; and hold quarterly distribution center safety committee meetings for cross-location collaboration. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and continue to implement additional safety measures in all our offices and facilities including: monitoring vaccine status and screening for symptoms indicative of COVID-19; requiring staff and visitors to wear masks if their vaccine status is unverified in order to seek to prevent community spread of COVID-19; continuing work from home flexibility; adjusting attendance policies and allowing occasional absence time to encourage those who are sick to stay home; increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures; requiring temperature screening of employees at our distribution facilities and twice-weekly testing for all unvaccinated employees at our distribution facilities; requiring physical distancing for employees who need to be onsite; providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies; modifying work spaces with plexiglass dividers and touchless faucets; and implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure. As of December 31, 2021, all HMH corporate offices were open on a voluntary basis and our distribution centers were open and operating at full capacity.  
 
Talent and Development: Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency. In 2021, we provided a company-wide employee engagement survey to all regular employees. We outperformed benchmarked peer companies, with engagement among our employees landing in the 86th percentile for all companies using Gallup’s Q12 Engagement Index, and in the 89th percentile among our peers. We additionally continue to provide all of our employees with a variety of training and development opportunities. All regular employees have access to Knowledge Network, HMH’s online learning management system offering over 13,500 on demand training courses and programs, live webinars and in-person training opportunities. More than 2,400 employees participated in training programs in 2021, including Unconscious Bias, Cybersecurity, Sales, Product and Change Management, with more than 42,500 courses completed across the Company for approximately 16,000 total

hours of completed course content. In 2021, we created a new Finance Enrichment Academy, focusing on accelerating the transformation of Finance talent through seven distinct curricula, and the expansion of the HMH Leadership Academy, offering four-month and six-month programs focused on developing critical leadership competencies and skills.
 
Diversity and Inclusion: We embrace the diversity of our employees, customers and stakeholders, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We take direct actions to attract, hire, and retain more diverse talent, nurture an inclusive workplace, and create opportunities for meaningful conversations about diversity. We aim to increase the diversity of our employee base by growing our diverse talent pipeline, including partnerships with organizations like SV Academy, HBCU Lifestyle, Handshake, HackerX, Circa, and Teach for America. We have a goal to build a highly engaged team by increasing retention year over year. As of December 31, 2021, we have established Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) goals regarding recruitment, engagement and retention of our employees who identify as people of color. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our domestic workforce was approximately 67% female and approximately 77% white, approximately 9% Hispanic or Latinx, approximately 8% Black or African American, approximately 5% Asian American, and approximately 1% two or more races or other. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of executive management roles were held by women and our executive management team was approximately 77% white, approximately 15% Black or African American, and approximately 8% Hispanic or Latinx. In 2021, we also conducted an optional company-wide employee survey regarding members and allies of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and/or Queer (LGBTQ+) community, and of the 2,030 employees who responded 7% consider themselves a member of the LGBTQ+ community. In addition, in 2021 approximately 1% of our domestic workforce includes a protected veteran population and approximately 1% of employees have voluntarily noted that they have a disability or previously had a disability.
 
As a learning technology company, we are committed to ongoing opportunities for education and growth. This includes formal and informal opportunities for meaningful conversations—from roundtable discussions to company-wide unconscious bias training. Learning and unlearning are lifelong practices that we must actively foster—in our schools, communities, and workplaces. Our cross-functional DEI Council’s work centers around four pillars—leadership, talent, culture, and business—and promotes social justice through Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), DEI trainings, and discussions on how to build an antiracist community. We have ERGs to support Black and African American, Latinx and Hispanic, LGBTQ+, Asian, disabled and neurodiverse, and female employees, in addition to ERGs focused on mental health and wellness. The ERGs hosted virtual activities throughout 2021.

We do not own any material patents, franchises or concessions, but we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in connection with our publishing businesses. We believe we have taken, and take in the ordinary course of business, appropriate available legal steps to reasonably protect our intellectual property in all material jurisdictions. 
 Environmental matters 
 We generally contract with independent printers and binders for their services, and our operations are generally not otherwise affected by environmental laws and regulations. However, as the owner and lessee of real property, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the remediation of contaminated sites and the handling and disposal of wastes. It is possible that we could face liability, regardless of fault, and can be held jointly or severally liable, if contamination were to be discovered on the properties that we own or lease or on properties that we have formerly owned or leased. We are currently unaware of any material environmental liabilities or other material environmental issues relating to our properties or operations and anticipate no material expenditures for compliance with environmental laws or regulations. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
 As a corporate citizen, we accept and promote a community responsibility to minimize our impact on the environment to ensure that we will be able to serve teachers, students and all readers for years to come. As such, we seek to make environmentally responsible choices in our business practices. We set objectives for continual improvement of our environmental and sustainability management procedures. In 2021, we made progress against our sustainability goals, and we strive to continually improve our efforts moving forward. Looking ahead, we are expanding our company-wide sustainability efforts, setting additional goals and measuring progress in other areas material to our business.
 Responsible Paper Usage
 One of our on-going sustainability focus areas is our approach to how we source, use and dispose of paper related to our products. In 2019, we strengthened and updated our Paper Sourcing and Usage Policy that reflects our continuing commitments to our environment and surroundings. Key 2021 progress highlights were: 98% of HMH purchased paper for education products was manufactured with no less than 10% recycled fiber.
Transportation 
 
A major aspect of our business involves the transportation of our products, and we work to promote environmentally friendly modes of such transportation. In 2021, HMH estimates that it saved 725,321 pounds of CO2 emissions by managing our carbon footprint by using intentional transportation methods, including consolidating shipments and shipping directly from vendors to end recipients when possible.
 
HMH participates in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) SmartWay program.  The EPA’s SmartWay program helps companies advance supply chain sustainability by measuring, benchmarking, and improving freight transportation efficiency. Through this program, HMH partners with the EPA to improve our shipping operations to achieve a more sustainable transportation process that directly facilitates a reduction in our carbon footprint. In 2021, HMH estimates that it saved 187,393 pounds of CO2 emissions by participating in the SmartWay program.
 
Waste Management and Recycling 
 
Whenever possible, we recycle our excess product and waste generated at our distribution centers and warehouses to avoid sending recyclable products and other waste to landfills.
 
•Donation is HMH’s preferred method of disposal for excess books and materials (rather than destruction), and prior to the divestiture of HMH Books & Media, HMH donated more than 161,400 books, including children and adult titles, to 45 nonprofit organizations during 2021.

•95% of the waste generated at HMH’s distribution centers and warehouses is recycled.
 
In our corporate offices, each employee has a recycling and a garbage bin.  We work to increase employee awareness regarding waste management and recycling with bins and signage. 
 
Energy Use
 
We continue to strive to reduce energy consumption at our HMH distribution centers, warehouses and related offices through: 
 
•Conversion to high efficiency fluorescent bulbs 
 •Conference rooms with motion sensor lighting
 •Energy-efficient HVAC and heating units
 •LED light fixtures in parking lots

Our values guide every aspect of our work. We believe that respecting and protecting human rights is fundamental to our work as a responsible company. We align with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights laws and standards and strive to embody these values in our culture. Our purpose-driven mission is strongly aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” We recognize the importance of evaluating and improving how our company, including our products and services, can contribute to education access and improved outcomes for learners. We also seek to embed respect for human rights across our business and with vendors and suppliers with whom we do business as set forth in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
At HMH, we believe in social justice. The critical work to improve DEI is an inward and outward process—we are constantly seeking new ways to better our own culture as we strive to better our world. We aim to create and cultivate an employee community, company culture and business strategy that reflects the diverse demographics and perspectives of our customers and employees.  Further, we embrace the diversity of our employees, customers and stakeholders, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level.  We take direct actions to nurture an inclusive workplace.
 
Our DEI Council is made up of a cross-functional, diverse group of employees that works and focuses on short-term and long-term initiatives with three main priorities in 2021: people manager training, mentoring opportunities, and building HMH as a model anti-racist company. The DEI Council supports our company-wide DEI efforts and takes actionable steps toward reaching our DEI goals. The council supports HMH’s ERGs, DEI trainings, and discussions on how to build HMH as a model antiracist community. In 2021, we launched HMH Mentoring, our re-imagined mentoring program, including the addition of group mentoring and the ability to choose to become a member of ERGs, in an effort to connect those with shared backgrounds and experiences. Last year, we also provided opportunities for education and growth, including formal and informal opportunities for meaningful conversations — namely, continued antiracism roundtable discussions and company-wide unconscious bias training for the majority of our employees. In addition, in support of growing our internal talent pipeline, in February 2021 we launched the Connected Leadership Engagement and Development Rotation Program (LEAD Connected), aimed at providing employees from historically marginalized backgrounds with growth and advancement opportunities.

As a learning technology company focused on empowering students and teachers, we believe it is our responsibility to build content and provide services and resources that foster a holistic understanding of our world and honor the diverse communities we serve. As an organization, we too are always learning and growing, and we will continue to be intentional about improvements we make as part of our continuous evolution. To that end, our Content Review Panel – a cross-disciplinary internal advisory board that focuses on equity, inclusion, and diversity in our solutions – reviews our content, striving for equitable, nonbiased, and sensitive treatment and representation for all individuals, communities, and experiences across all HMH programs, services, and platforms. In 2021, the Content Review Panel reviewed over 150,000 pieces of content. During 2021, we also established our Equity Advisory Council for Learning that partners with leading education scholars, practitioners, and advocates with HMH employees, forming a community of experts focused on the continuous improvement of our K-12 curriculum and materials in this area.
 
As outlined in our Content, Equity, Inclusion and Diversity pledge available on our website at https://www.hmhco.com/diversity-equity-inclusion/our-world, we are committed to producing curriculum in which all students can see themselves and the possibilities for their future success. Our programs are strongest when they resonate with learners, inspire connections and spark dialogue, and honor the unique qualities and experiences of every learner. 
 
In 2020, a cross-functional Supplier Diversity Council was formed to drive HMH’s Supplier Diversity Program forward. The council is focused on fostering meaningful partnerships with diverse suppliers in all areas of HMH’s business – aiming to establish new partnerships with small and diverse suppliers while also deepening relationships with diverse suppliers that HMH already works with. In 2021, this initiative continued to take shape with further definition of the diverse supplier categories in our program, the creation of a supplier portal where current and prospective suppliers can share their diverse certification(s) and the creation of a webpage on our company website available at https://www.hmhco.com/hmh-supplier-diversity.  As part of our commitment to supplier diversity, HMH is a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council.
