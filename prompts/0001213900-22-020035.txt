ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We primarily engage in studying, developing, manufacturing and selling bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers, amino acid water-soluble fertilizers, selenium-rich foliage fertilizers and other types of fertilizers in the PRC through our subsidiary, Jiangxi Kenongwo Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangxi Kenongwo”), a company incorporated under the laws of the PRC.



The main raw materials that are used in our organic fertilizers include bamboo charcoal, bamboo vinegar, rapeseed dregs and organic selenium. Bamboo charcoal is carbonized from bamboo and it is an excellent fertilizer carrier that can slowly release the fertilizer substance and at the same time reduce the pollution in the soil. Bamboo vinegar is a liquid obtained by condensing the water volatile organics in Moso bamboo, which is released during the high temperature pyrolysis through our patented technology. Fermented rapeseed dregs are the component of organic materials, which can significantly impact the quality of soil. Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is important for many bodily processes. By adding organic selenium into our fertilizers and applying them to the crops, selenium can be well absorbed and converted, making the final agricultural products rich of selenium. Our fertilizers also provide optimum levels of primary plant nutrients which including multi-minerals, proteins and carbohydrates that promote the healthiest soils capable of growing the healthy crops and vegetables. It can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as well as reduce the penetration of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil and thus avoid water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve fertility of soil, and the quality and safety of agricultural products.



We generate our revenue from the sales of our organic fertilizers, compound fertilizers, specific-function fertilizers and crop-specific fertilizers. We currently have one integrated factory covering a land area of 143,590 square feet in Yichun City, Jiangxi Province, PRC to produce our organic fertilizers, which has been in operations since 2017. We plan to expand our production capacity and build an automatic and standardized production line, equipped with fully automatic production machines for our fertilizers, including fermentation machines, granulation machines, drying and cooling machines, labeling machines, packaging machines and loading and unloading machines. Specifically, we plan to establish four automated production lines, including (1) the powder fertilizer production line, (2) the granular fertilizer production line, (3) the liquid water soluble fertilizer production line and (4) the powder water soluble fertilizer production line. As of the date of this report, (3) and (4) have been completed. In addition, we also installed the liquid raw material automatic storage tank system, the palletizing robot system and the raw material weighing and batching system. The estimated cost of building this production line is approximately RMB12 million (approximately $1.7 million). we plan to finance this amount in equity or debt. There is no assurance that we could raise that amount on satisfying terms. As a result, the implementation of this expansion depends on whether and when we could secure the financing.



We believe that our brand reputation and ability to tailor our products to meet the requirements of various regions of the PRC affords us a competitive advantage. We purchase the majority of our raw materials from suppliers located in the PRC and use suppliers that are located in close proximity to our manufacturing facilities, which helps us to control our cost of revenue.



China is the principal market for our products, which are primarily sold to farmers through distributors in over twenty-two provinces in China, including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hainan, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Guangxi, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Yunnan, Ningxia, Gansu, Henan, and Hebei provinces.



In 2019, the Company and two other individuals, Mr. Haijin Li and Mr. Weizhong Zhang, jointly formed Longyan Fuchi Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. (“Longyan”) pursuant to a cooperation agreement dated April 27, 2019 (the “Cooperation Agreement”). According to the Cooperation Agreement, the Company and Mr. Zhang together shall invest RMB540,000 (approximately $77,510) to Longyan, which, in exchange, will result in the Company and Mr. Zhang owning 25% and 20% equity interest in Longyan, respectively. As of the date of this report, the Company has invested RMB 200,000 (approximately $28,955) to and as a result owns 25% equity interest in Longyan. Longyan is an agricultural company with a primary focus on growing and selling passionfruit, in which the Company perceives excellent potentials in Fujian province. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, the Company shall jointly manage Longyan with Mr. Li and Mr. Zhang.



Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, our business operations were adversely impacted. In particular, the lockdown policy in China has caused delays in the logistics industry and consequently, the supply of our raw materials was impacted. In addition, the restrictions of face-to-face interactions have slowed down the process of our marketing, client meeting and new products launching activities. The spread of COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China. People’s daily life and businesses’ operations started going to normalcy. As a result, we believe these negative impacts are temporary. However, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the economy of China and the rest of the world and, as such, the extent of the business disruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.



China is the principal market for our products, which are primarily sold to our customers through distributors in over twenty provinces in China, including Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hainan, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Yunnan and Guangxi provinces

Industry Overview



Overview of the PRC Fertilizer Industry



According to Gulf Petrochemicals & Chemicals Association, China is the biggest fertilizer producer and consumer in the world. Total fertilizer consumption in China represents around a third of global fertilizer use. According to China Fertilizers Market - Growth, Trends, And Forecasts (2019–2024) (source: www.mordorintelligence.com), the China fertilizers market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.62% during the forecast period, 2019-2024. The market growth is restrained by the Chinese government’s zero-growth policy and environmental protection policy system for rural areas and the agricultural sector, in order to control the pollution and achieve green development. The national policies prohibit the use of pesticides, and require organic fertilizers to replace chemical fertilizers. In 2020, there was zero-growth in fertilizer and pesticide consumption. The policymakers are adjusting fertilizer consumption structure and promoting accurate fertilization, improved fertilization, and use of more micronutrients and secondary fertilizers, as compared to straight fertilizers, particularly nitrogenous fertilizers. This policy is expected to provide a fillip to the growth of the market for bio-fertilizers in China.
Increasing Demand for Organic and Bio-fertilizers



According to the Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China (MOA), the use of organic fertilizers as a replacement for chemical fertilizers is one of the key points of agricultural supply-side structural reform in China, and it has a restraining influence on the growth of the chemical fertilizers market in China. The key crops used in the country for the trial fertilizer-replacement program are fruits, vegetables, tea, and others. In May 2016, the “Soil Pollution Prevention Action Plan” was issued to provide strong support for the promotion of organic fertilizer in the country. The government accords great importance to the production of organic fertilizers, and implements a tax exemption policy (implemented in 2016) for bio-organic fertilizer products, providing further support for the development of the organic fertilizer industry in China. The rising number of product innovations and activities in the organic fertilizer market in China act as a restraint to the chemical fertilizers market. All the products we currently sell qualify as the type of organic fertilizers discussed in this section.











According to a press release by Ken Research dated January 23, 2020 (source: https://www.openpr.com/news/1905736/china-complex-fertilizer-market-is-driven-by-rise-in-net), the long term growth potential of the industry remains optimistic of fertilizer market in China as China’s food grain production is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3% during 2017-2022 from 621.1 million MT* in 2017 to 663.2 million MT by 2022. Additionally, government support to agriculture industry in China would act as another growth promoting factor to fertilizer industry in China. However, the emerging segment in the coming years would be the organic fertilizers with the government of China planning additional farm subsidies, elimination of certain land taxes, land reform initiatives to promote organically grown products.

Our Products



We are committed to ensuring the quality of our products and production is in compliance with GB/T19001-2016/ISO 9001: 2015 Standard Quality System, which is the standard system used by organizations to demonstrate their ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and regulatory requirements and to demonstrate continuous improvement. GB/T19001-2016 is the China national standard for quality management system requirements, including the examination standards and packaging standards. ISO 9001: 2015 is the international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system, covering a broad range of activities, services and products, from the procurement of raw materials to the release of final products. We aim to provide high-quality and environmental friendly organic fertilizer to our customers. Our organic fertilizers are the products of natural decomposition and are easy for plants to absorb and digest. Our core products are bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers, amino acid water-soluble fertilizers and selenium-rich foliar fertilizers. The main raw materials used in these products are bamboo charcoal, bamboo vinegar, rapeseed dregs and organic selenium, which are mainly obtained through calcination, distillation, extraction of moso bamboo and transformation of other plants. Our products can be divided into three categories based on their functions: general-function fertilizers, specific-function fertilizers and crop-specific fertilizers.

1. | General-Function Fertilizers - Bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our general-function fertilizers can be applied to all kinds of crops to promote their growth. Bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer is our flagship product under this category. Bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer is developed on the basis of plant nutrition, soil biology and physical characteristics of the bamboo charcoal. Bamboo charcoal, one of the main components of bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers, is carbonized from bamboo through our patented technology. We use bamboo charcoal, rapeseed dregs, bamboo vinegar liquid, amino acid, beneficial microbial flora and other metal ions (such as copper, iron, zinc and boron) as main raw materials and adopt international advanced production technology to compound them into the final product.



Growing in the natural environment, bamboo absorbs a large amount of water-soluble minerals such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. These minerals will be dissolved and condensed in the bamboo charcoal after the bamboo is smoldered under high temperature.






(Structure of bamboo charcoal)











Our bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer can promote the reproduction of a large number of probiotic strains around the roots of farm crops, and meanwhile prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms, thus making the fertilizer to has functions of nitrogen fixation, phosphorus-dissolving and kalium-dissolving, among others. Our bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer can also greatly improve the contents and effectiveness of the N, P, K, Ca, Fe and other elements in the soil. Bamboo charcoal itself can adsorb and passivate heavy metals and pesticide residues in the soil and therefore improve the quality of farm crops. In addition, bamboo charcoal can enhance the soil permeability, increase crop root activity, promote photosynthesis, maintain nutrient components in the soil, enhance crops’ resistance ability and prevent the occurrence of crop diseases and insect pests. When using our bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizer in acidic soil, the bamboo charcoal substance’s PH value can improve the acidity balance of the soil, making the soil more suitable for growing crops.



Our general-function fertilizer products also include bamboo compound fertilizer and water-soluble fertilizer with amino acid.




2. | Specific-Function Fertilizers
---+------------------------------




Our specific-function fertilizers are designed to provide specific benefits to crops. Our selenium-rich foliar fertilizers can promote the content of selenium in the final agricultural products. Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is important for many bodily processes. By adding organic selenium into our fertilizers and applying them to the crops, selenium can be well absorbed and converted. In addition, the major components in our amino acid water-soluble fertilizers are bamboo vinegar. We mixed bamboo vinegar and other microelements, making our fertilizers rich of nutrition while adding no sterols of any kind. Bamboo vinegar can enhance plants’ abilities to absorb nutrition from soil and degrade the fertilizer residues. These fertilizers can be applied to the soil or sprayed on crops aboveground directly or indirectly in order to supply nutrients, increasing crop yields and improving product quality.




3. | Crop-Specific Fertilizers 
---+------------------------------




We also provide fertilizers that are designed for specific crops based on soil tests. The use of soil tests can help determine the status of nutrients available to plants in soil, thus it develops fertilizer recommendations to achieve optimum crop production. For example, we have designed and manufactured special fertilizer products for blueberries, dragon fruits and jackfruits. The best soil for blueberries to grow is acidic with a PH scale of 4.3 to 5.3 and has an organic-material level of 8% to 12%. Our blueberry fertilizers can effectively resolve the imbalance between the PH scale and organic-material level.



China’s fertilizer market is highly commercialized and therefore we adopted a multi-level brand strategy to target different market segments with tailored products. At present, selenium-rich foliar fertilizer and bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers are marketed as high-end products, compound fertilizers as intermediate products, and amino acid water-soluble fertilizers as low-end products. We have so far developed nearly 20 kinds of products. In general, we believe our fertilizers have the following characteristics and advantages:




● | Increase the amount of probiotic strains and prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Help the soil fix nitrogen, dissolve phosphorus and dissolution and better release the nutrients in the soil; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adsorb and passivate heavy metals and pesticide residues in soil; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enrich the mineral content of the soil, increase the organic matters in the soil and therefor increase the crop yield rate; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance soil permeability, increase crop root activity and promote photosynthesis; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase significantly the protein, vitamin, and mineral contents of most fruits and vegetables; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase the water retention of soil to help plants to resist drought; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase aeration of the soil.

The machinery and vats for the line have been supplied by a local medical machinery manufacturer and the automated control systems were developed by us. Our access rights management system ensures that our proprietary ingredient mixes are protected at all times. Also, by linking the computer server with the electronic weights on each of the material input bins, the exact quantity of each element is delivered every time, thus maintaining quality and reducing waste. We also plan to establish an automatic production line controlled by a computer system to manage raw materials processing, which will control the process of fermenting and grinding raw materials, subject to our securing necessary financing to support this plan. Specifically, we plan to establish four automated production lines, including (1) the powder fertilizer production line, (2) the granular fertilizer production line, (3) the liquid water soluble fertilizer production line, and (4) the powder water soluble fertilizer production line). As of the date of this report, (3) and (4) have been completed. In addition, we also installed the liquid raw material automatic storage tank system, the palletizing robot system and the raw material weighing and batching system.
Sales and Marketing



We believe that our sales services, combined with the quality and reputation of our products will help us retain and attract new customers. Our salesmen are trained to work closely with distributors and customers to select suitable products and provide post-sales support. In addition, our salespersons share their knowledges in the fertilizer industry through organizing and opening agricultural technology training courses to the public.



China’s fertilizer market is highly commercialized and therefore we adopted a multi-level brand strategy to target different market segments with tailored products. At present, selenium-rich foliar fertilizer and bamboo charcoal biomass organic fertilizers are marketed as high-end products, compound fertilizers as intermediate products, and amino acid water-soluble fertilizers as low-end products.



We distribute and sell our products to our end-customers through several different channels, including professional markets, sales department of our company and distributors:




● | Professional Market: we built cooperation relationship with private agricultural companies and agricultural cooperative associations for sales;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sales Team: we have a team of 8 marketing leaders who are responsible for collecting and correlating marketing data from 27 provinces in the PRC and they are professionally trained to promote and deliver products to our customers;

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------












We currently sell our products through a carefully constructed network covering approximately 300 regional distributors in over 20 provinces across China. The distributors, in turn, sell the products to smaller local retail stores which then sell them to end users (typically farmers). We do not grant provincial or regional exclusive rights because there is currently no single distributor strong enough to warrant exclusive rights. We enter into non-exclusive written distribution agreements with selected distributors who demonstrate their local business experience and extensive regional sales network. The agreements do not specify the length of the engagement. The typical terms in a distribution agreement are regarding the sales amount of the products, the specification of the products, the means of transportation and the place of products’ delivery. Although our distributors and agents also work with other fertilizer manufacturers to sell their products, we have established our reputation in the market and approximately 30% of the products sold by our distributors and agents were supplied by us. We also plan to work with overseas distributors, such as the distributors in Malaysia, to sell our products, especially our high-purity bamboo vinegar and organic selenium products. 



By using various channels to sell and distribute our products to customers, we can directly serve our customers and end-customers by providing customer service and support.



Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our Strategies and Competitive Strength



We intend to build upon our proven ability to produce high-quality organic fertilizer and increase our presence and market share in the agriculture industry. The summary of our competitive strength is as follows:
Products with Selenium



Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is important for many bodily processes. Our factory is located in an area that has high level of selenium in soil and water which provides us the advantage of manufacturing selenium-rich fertilizer products. By adding organic selenium into our fertilizers and applying them to the crops, selenium can be well absorbed and converted, making the final agricultural products rich of selenium.
Nationwide Distribution Network



We have established our own distribution channels with approximately 300 distributors in over 20 provinces in China, enabling our products to be sold to retail stores across the country. We are continuing expanding our distribution network through developing more distributors and we plan to sell our fertilizers to more provinces in China.
Powerful Research & Development (“R&D”) Strength



It typically takes us three to six months from designing a product to putting it into production. Our R&D department is based on our intelligent greenhouse facilities which simulate the natural environment and soil conditions in different seasons. Our laboratory work, therefore, can accelerate the product development cycle. We are now able to design and provide customized fertilizers products based the specific crop, type of soil and weather conditions, allowing us to diversify our fertilizers to offer more options to our customers.
Automatic Production Line



Our automated production line for product processing is run by a central control system and only needs the input of control technicians. This central control system manages the process of producing products, including automatically feeding materials to machines, blending materials and controlling other manufacturing, packaging and stacking process. We also plan to establish an automatic production line controlled by a computer system to manage raw materials processing, including fermenting and grinding raw materials, subject to our securing of a future financing. Specifically, we plan to establish four automated production line, including (1) the powder fertilizer production line, (2) the granular fertilizer production line, (3) the liquid water-soluble fertilizer production line, and (4) the powder water soluble fertilizer production line). As of the date of this report, (3) and (4) have been completed. Also, our specialized bamboo charcoal production line is patented (patent number: ZL 2017 2 1264881.3).
After-sales Service

All of our R&D and execution personnel has entered into confidentiality agreements with us. Furthermore, it is contractually agreed that any work product is owned by the Company. We have further taken steps to restrict the number of persons involving in production. Instead of providing production personnel with the list of fertilizer ingredients, we give them the digit codes representing the ingredients to better protect the formula of our fertilizers.



Seasonality



We experience seasonality in our business, reflecting seasonal fluctuations in food productions and storages. For example, we generally experience higher transaction volumes during spring and fall. Our water-soluble fertilizers have a steady sale volume throughout the year, but our selenium-rich foliar fertilizers usually become more popular one month before the crops are ready to be harvested as that is the best time to apply the selenium-rich foliar fertilizers.
Employees



As of the date of this report, we have 57 full-time employees and 21 part-time employees. The departments cover, sales and marketing, administration, customer service, accounting, design, research and development and human resources. We are required under PRC law to make contributions to employee benefit plans for our PRC-based full-time employees at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of such employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local governments in China and we also are required to make contributions to the work-related injury insurance for the part-time employees. We maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material labor disputes in the past. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.
Environmental Law Compliance



We believe that our manufacturing facilities are currently operating under compliance with provincial and central environmental laws in the PRC. We plan to continue acquiring environmental-oriented equipment and incurring the expenditures we deem necessary for compliance with applicable laws. Expenditures relating to compliance for operating facilities incurred in the past have not significantly affected our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Insurance



We provide social security insurance including medical insurance, maternity insurance, workplace injury insurance, unemployment insurance and pension benefits for our employees. Consistent with customary industry practice in China, we do not maintain business interruption insurance, nor do we maintain product liability insurance or key-man life insurance.
Regulations on Fertilizer License



The examination and approval of fertilizer license is based on Article 25 of the Agricultural Law of the People’s Republic of China, the Management for the Administration of Fertilizer Registration (Order No. 32 and No. 38 by the Ministry of Agriculture), and the Requirements for Fertilizer Registration Materials (Publication No. 161 from the Ministry of Agriculture). Organic fertilizers are required to be registered with provincial agricultural department.



There are four examination and approval requirements for obtaining a fertilizer license: (1) a valid business license issued by Administration for Industry and Commerce, of which the business scope shall cover the industry of fertilizer; (2) products must comply with relevant requirements of laws, regulations and relevant national policies (such as safety and environmental protection); (3) product quality must comply with national standards, industry standards, local standards or enterprise standards approved by the quality supervision department; and (4) application materials must be true, legal, complete and effective.



Our products and services are subject to the regulation of the government agencies of China and Jiangxi Province.



To produce amino acid water-soluble fertilizers, a fertilizer registration certificate must be issued by the Agricultural Ministry of the People’s Republic of China. Our fertilizer registration certificate is numbered Nong Fei (2018) Zhun No. 7964, expiring in February 2023.



To produce powder or granular organic fertilizers, a fertilizer registration certificate of Jiangxi Province is required, to be reviewed and issued by Yichun Fertilizer Registration Review Committee. Our fertilizer registration certificate is numbered Gan Nong Fei (2017) Zhun No. C0035, expiring in October 2022.
