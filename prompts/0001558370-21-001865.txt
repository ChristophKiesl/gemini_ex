ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
We are a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments for patients suffering from severe neurological diseases. We focus on neurological diseases where we believe an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy approach that either increases or decreases the production of a specific protein can slow or reduce the symptoms experienced by patients, and therefore have a clinically meaningful impact. We have built a gene therapy platform that we believe positions us to be a leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and severe neurological disease. Our gene therapy platform enables us to engineer, optimize, manufacture and deliver our AAV-based gene therapies that have the potential to provide durable efficacy following a single administration. 
Additionally, we are working to identify novel AAV capsids, which are the outer viral protein shells that enclose the genetic material of the virus payload. Our team of experts in the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects severe neurological diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors for delivery of the virus payload to the targeted tissue or cells. Our manufacturing process employs an established system that we believe will enable production of high quality AAV vectors at commercial scale. In addition to our capsid optimization efforts, we leverage novel delivery paradigms,

established routes of administration, and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV gene therapies to target tissues, regions and cell types that are critical to the disease of interest. We believe we can achieve this directly, with targeted infusions to discrete regions of the brain or spinal cord, or systemically, in conjunction with our novel capsids.
Our business strategy focuses on discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing our gene therapy programs. As part of this strategy, we have developed core competencies specific to AAV gene therapy development and manufacturing and are beginning to build our commercial infrastructure. This business strategy also includes business development activities that may include in-licensing activities or partnering certain programs in specific geographies with collaborators, as we have demonstrated through our ongoing collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., which we refer to as Neurocrine. Since our inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, determining which neurological diseases to pursue, advancing our product candidates including delivery and manufacturing, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock and our strategic collaborations, including our prior collaborations with Sanofi Genzyme Corporation, or Sanofi Genzyme, and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. and AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company, which we collectively refer to as AbbVie, and our ongoing collaboration with Neurocrine.
Our pipeline of gene therapy programs is summarized in the table below: 

Our pipeline consists of wholly-owned programs for severe neurological indications, including Huntington’s disease; a monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS; and tau-related diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, and progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP. We may seek orphan drug designation, breakthrough therapy designation, or other expedited review processes for certain of our product candidates in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Additionally, we have partnered with Neurocrine on programs for severe neurological diseases including Parkinson’s disease and Friedreich’s ataxia. We refer to our collaboration with Neurocrine as the Neurocrine Collaboration.

As part of the Neurocrine Collaboration, we and Neurocrine have been developing VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, or the VY-AADC Program. VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) is currently being evaluated in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. In December 2020, the FDA notified Neurocrine that the FDA had placed a clinical hold on the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, and has subsequently informed Neurocrine of the information required to provide a complete response to the FDA. In February 2021, Neurocrine notified us of its termination of the Neurocrine Collaboration with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective August 2, 2021, or the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. Upon the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, the license granted by us to Neurocrine will expire and we will regain worldwide intellectual property rights to the VY-AADC Program in accordance with the collaboration agreement. We intend to support Neurocrine, the study sponsor and IND holder, on ongoing matters related to the completion of imaging and clinical assessments requested by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, or DSMB, and the provision of other information requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. The imaging requests include additional magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans from the participants in the Phase 1b trials and positron emission tomography, or PET, scans from the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial participants. We plan to determine the potential path forward for the VY-AADC Program based on, among other things, the additional information being collected by Neurocrine in response to the DSMB requests. 
VY-HTT01 is our clinical gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. VY-HTT01 is composed of an AAV capsid (AAV1) and a proprietary transgene that harnesses the RNA interference pathway to selectively knock down, or reduce, levels of HTT mRNA. 
In non-human primate studies, one-time administration of VY-HTT01 resulted in robust and durable reduction of HTT mRNA and protein with knock-down stabilization between six and twelve months, and widespread distribution of VY-HTT01 vector genome across the striatum and cortex. VY-HTT01 treatment demonstrated robust reduction of HTT mRNA and protein in the YAC128 and BACHD transgenic mouse models of Huntington’s disease, with significant improvements in motor function. We plan to present preclinical data from the IND-enabling studies at a medical conference in 2021.
In September 2020, we submitted an IND application to evaluate VY-HTT01 in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with Huntington’s disease. In October 2020, the FDA placed a clinical hold on our IND application pending the resolution of certain chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information requests. We have subsequently received written feedback from the FDA requesting additional information on specific CMC topics, including drug device compatibility and drug substance and product characterization. We expect to provide our complete response to the additional requests from the FDA regarding the IND application for VY-HTT01 in the first half of 2021. Subject to our resolution of the clinical hold and the clearance of our IND application, we expect to initiate our clinical evaluation of VY-HTT01.
We are pursuing additional product candidates in the preclinical stages of development, including treatment programs for Friedreich’s ataxia, ALS, tau-related neurodegenerative diseases, and other severe neurological diseases. We continue to evaluate additional severe neurological diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy through application of either a gene replacement or a gene knockdown approach and are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector. 
Finally, we have developed our real-time, intra-operative, MRI compatible device, the variable trajectory array guide, or V-TAG®, that can be used with other neuro-navigational systems for the administration of drugs and other surgical procedures, to avoid blood vessels and reduce the risk of potential hemorrhage during surgery, and to maximize drug coverage of the targeted structures. In July 2018, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or the CDRH, of the FDA, provided 510(k) clearance for V-TAG. We are currently working with ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (formerly known as MRI Interventions, Inc.), or CLPT, on process development and manufacturing of the device, and in March 2019, we transferred our premarket notification (510(k)) clearance for V-TAG to CLPT. Investigators have used an alternative MRI-compatible device called the ClearPoint® System in our Phase 1 and Phase 1b clinical trials and in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817). We currently plan to use either the V-TAG or the ClearPoint System in our Phase 1b clinical trial of VY-HTT01 for Huntington’s disease.

Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration
In February 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme to leverage our combined expertise and assets to develop AAV gene therapies for certain severe neurological diseases. Under the agreement, we received $65.0 million in upfront cash, a $30.0 million upfront equity investment, and an in-kind commitment of $5.0 million, totaling $100.0 million. At the inception of the agreement, we were eligible to receive up to $745.0 million in option and milestone payments while retaining U.S. commercial rights to most programs. Under the terms of the collaboration, we granted Sanofi Genzyme an exclusive option (i) to license, develop and commercialize ex-U.S. rights to VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for Parkinson’s disease, or the VY-AADC Program, VY-FXN01 for Friedreich’s ataxia, or the FA Program, VY-HTT01 for Huntington’s disease, or the Huntington’s Program, and a future program to be designated by Sanofi Genzyme, or the Future Program, which we refer to collectively as the Split Territory Programs; (ii) to license, develop and commercialize worldwide rights to VY-SMN101, our spinal muscular atrophy program; and (iii) to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States. Each of Sanofi Genzyme’s options to a Split Territory Program was triggered following the completion of the first proof-of-principle human clinical study, or POP Study, on a program-by-program basis.
In October 2017, Sanofi Genzyme notified us that it had decided not to exercise its option for the ex-U.S. rights to the VY-AADC Program. As a result, we were no longer entitled to receive $45.0 million and $60.0 million of regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Sanofi Genzyme, respectively, related to the VY-AADC Program. If we use certain Sanofi Genzyme technology in VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), Sanofi Genzyme is entitled to receive low-single-digit royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales by us, and we may be obligated to make certain regulatory milestone payments to a third-party licensor. 
In June 2019, we and Sanofi Genzyme executed a termination agreement to terminate the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration Agreement, or the Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement. Under the terms of the Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, Sanofi Genzyme relinquished its rights to the exclusive license options to the Huntington’s Program, the FA Program, and the Future Program. We have been relieved of our obligations to perform the research and development services under those programs through completion of the respective POP Studies. As a result, we gained worldwide rights to the Huntington’s Program, and ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program. In accordance with our Collaboration and License Agreement with Neurocrine, or the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program then passed to Neurocrine. Additionally, we and Sanofi Genzyme entered into the Amended and Restated Option and License Agreement related to certain AAV capsids, or the Amended Capsid Agreement. Under the Amended Capsid Agreement, Sanofi Genzyme obtains exclusive option rights to select up to two novel AAV capsids owned or controlled by us for exclusive use for up to an aggregate of two non-central nervous system, or CNS, indications.
Under the Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, we made a $10.0 million upfront payment to Sanofi Genzyme and an additional $10.0 million milestone payment to Sanofi Genzyme following the filing of our IND application for a product candidate incorporating certain intellectual property rights developed under or substantially related to, the Huntington’s Program, which we refer to as a Post-Termination HD Product. We have agreed to pay Sanofi Genzyme (i) 50% of any income received from sublicensing arrangements related to Post-Termination HD Products in excess of specified thresholds and entered into prior to (a) the filing of an IND application for a Post-Termination HD Product or (b) the dosing of the first patient in a clinical trial for a Post-Termination HD Product in the United States or certain European countries, respectively and (ii) a low-double digit percentage of any income received from sublicensing arrangements outside the United States related to products incorporating intellectual property rights developed under, or substantially related to, the FA Program, which we refer to as Post-Termination FA Products, that are in excess of a specified threshold and entered into prior to the dosing of the first patient in a clinical trial for a Post-Termination FA Product in the United States or certain European countries, in each case, subject to certain limitations. We have also agreed to pay low-single-digit royalties on net sales of Post-Termination HD Products. Under the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration Agreement, we had rights to certain in-kind services. As of the effective date of the Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, we waived our right to approximately $0.4 million in unused in-kind services, we have relinquished our rights to the spinal muscular atrophy program, and we no longer have the right to receive any option payments, regulatory or commercial milestone payments or royalties from Sanofi Genzyme under the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration Agreement.

AbbVie Tau Collaboration
In February 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, for the research, development, and commercialization of AAV and other virus-based gene therapy products for the treatment of diseases of the CNS and other neurodegenerative diseases related to defective or excess aggregation of tau protein in the human brain, including Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $69.0 million and were eligible to receive option exercise payments, future development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties prior to the termination of the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, effective August 3, 2020, the AbbVie Collaboration Termination Date. We expect to continue to advance the research and development efforts related to vectorized antibodies, including vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein, and we are currently evaluating our options for advancing these efforts individually or with other potential collaborators. 
In connection with the termination of the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, we were obligated to undertake certain transition activities, including transferring to AbbVie certain data and reports generated under the collaboration as well as any regulatory filing relating to certain compounds and product candidates investigated in the collaboration. All such activities were completed on or prior to September 30, 2020. As a result of the termination, we have been relieved of future research and development obligations under the collaboration. Exclusivity provisions restricting either party or any of its respective affiliates from directly or indirectly exploiting any vectorized antibody compound targeting a tau protein and restricting us, alone or jointly with any third party, from directly or indirectly exploiting specified antibodies targeting a tau protein have also terminated. Each party retains a royalty-free, exclusive license to the other’s interest in certain intellectual property rights developed by or on behalf of either party under the collaboration, or the Joint IP, to exploit antibodies it contributed to the collaboration as well as a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to the Joint IP for any other purpose. Further, AbbVie has granted us, effective as of the AbbVie Collaboration Termination Date, a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (though multiple tiers), exclusive license to AbbVie’s interest in the Joint IP to exploit research compounds or product candidates that were investigated under the collaboration and do not encode antibodies contributed by AbbVie or include active pharmaceutical ingredients owned by AbbVie or its affiliates, for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses. We are not obligated to repay the upfront payment we received from AbbVie in connection with entering into the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement but are no longer eligible to receive option payments, milestone payments or royalties thereunder.
AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration
In February 2019, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, for the development and commercialization of vectorized antibodies directed against pathological species of alpha-synuclein for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies. Under the terms of the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $65.0 million and were eligible to receive option exercise payments, future development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties prior to the termination of the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, effective August 3, 2020, the AbbVie Collaboration Termination Date. 
In connection with the termination of the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement, we were obligated to undertake certain transition activities including transferring to AbbVie certain data and reports generated under the collaboration as well as any regulatory filings relating to compounds and product candidates investigated in the collaboration. All such activities were completed on or prior to September 30, 2020. As a result of the termination, we have been relieved of future research and development obligations under the collaboration. Exclusivity provisions restricting either party or any of its respective affiliates from directly or indirectly exploiting any vectorized antibody compound targeting an alpha-synuclein protein and restricting us, alone or jointly with any third party, from directly or indirectly exploiting specified antibodies have also terminated. AbbVie retains a royalty-free, exclusive license to our interest in the Joint IP to exploit antibodies AbbVie contributed to the collaboration. We otherwise retain a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to AbbVie’s interest in the Joint IP. We are not obligated to repay the upfront payment we received

from AbbVie in connection with entering into the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration Agreement but are no longer eligible to receive option payments, milestone payments, or royalties thereunder.
We are evaluating our options for potentially advancing our alpha-synuclein program in the future.
​
Neurocrine Collaboration
In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of four programs including the VY-AADC Program, FA Program, and other undisclosed programs, or the Discovery Programs. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement became effective in March 2019 following expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $115.0 million and may receive future development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties. In connection with the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine also paid us $50.0 million as consideration for an equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock. In June 2019, in conjunction with the termination of the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration Agreement, we gained worldwide rights to the Huntington’s Program and ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program. Our ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program were transferred to Neurocrine pursuant to the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. To facilitate the transfer of the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine, we and Neurocrine amended the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and we received a $5.0 million payment from Neurocrine. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the products in each of these programs under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. Neurocrine is responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting these activities for each program, in accordance with an agreed budget.
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the VY-AADC Program, Neurocrine agreed to fund the clinical development of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817). After the data readout of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, we would have had the option to either: (i) co-commercialize VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) with Neurocrine in the United States under a 50/50 cost- and profit-sharing arrangement and receive milestones and royalties based on ex-U.S. sales, or (ii) grant Neurocrine full global commercial rights in exchange for milestone payments and royalties based on global sales. We were eligible to receive aggregate development milestone payments under the VY-AADC Program of up to $170.0 million. We were also eligible to receive royalties, based on future net sales of the collaboration product for the VY-AADC Program in and outside the U.S. as applicable, at a rate of mid-teens to thirty and low-teens to twenty, respectively.
On February 2, 2021, Neurocrine notified us that it has elected to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement solely with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective August 2, 2021, or the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in full force and effect for each other program thereunder. As a result of the termination, as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, the license granted by us to Neurocrine under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the VY-AADC Program will expire and we will regain worldwide intellectual property rights regarding the VY-AADC Program, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. We intend to support Neurocrine, the study sponsor and IND holder, on ongoing matters related to the completion of imaging and clinical assessments requested by the DSMB and the provision of other information requested by the FDA for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. We plan to determine the potential path forward for the VY-AADC Program based on the additional information being collected by Neurocrine in response to the DSMB requests. Subsequent to the VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, Neurocrine will no longer reimburse us for research and development activities related to the VY-AADC Program.
In addition to the upfront payment, we are eligible to receive aggregate development milestone payments under the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and under each of the Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million per program. We may also be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each collaboration product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestone payments across all programs of $1.1 billion. We are also eligible to receive royalties, based on future net sales of the collaboration products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (i) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens 

10



and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (ii) for each Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively. 
Mission and Strategy 
Our mission is to become the world leader in AAV gene therapy focused on treating severe neurological diseases by developing transformative therapies. Our strategy to achieve this mission is to: 

● | Optimize and advance our gene therapy programs. We have a deep pipeline of AAV gene therapy programs in various stages of development. Our most advanced clinical candidate, VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is being evaluated in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial which is currently on clinical hold by the FDA. We have completed preclinical studies and submitted an IND application for VY-HTT01, our clinical candidate for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. The IND was placed on hold pending the resolution of additional information requested on CMC topics. We have several additional gene therapy programs in preclinical development. We plan to advance these programs, either on our own or with collaborative partners, to clinical evaluation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Partner and collaborate to enhance our pipeline of gene therapy programs focused on severe neurological diseases. We believe that our leadership position in AAV gene therapy for severe neurological diseases and our gene therapy platform provide us with the necessary capabilities to evaluate and capitalize on external opportunities. As such, we plan to opportunistically expand our pipeline through acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transactions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuously invest in our AAV gene therapy platform. We plan to continuously invest in our gene therapy platform to maintain our leadership in AAV gene therapy for neurological diseases. Specifically, we intend to further develop and enhance our gene therapy platform by focusing on (i) vector engineering and optimization; and (ii) dosing and delivery techniques. We plan to continue generating novel AAV vectors by engineering and optimizing vectors best suited to a targeted disease. Leveraging our research efforts on our TRACER system and novel capsid discovery, we believe that our gene therapy platform will have the ability to optimally treat certain neurological diseases through systemic delivery of our AAV gene therapies. We expect to utilize established and novel techniques for dosing and delivery of our AAV gene therapies to improve transduction efficiency and immune response.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establish a leadership position in commercial-scale, high quality AAV manufacturing. We believe that manufacturing capacity and expertise are critical to successfully treating patients using gene therapy. We have built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at laboratory scale. We have established relationships with multiple current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, contract manufacturers. Previously, through our collaborations with MassBiologics, an FDA-licensed manufacturer affiliated with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, we initiated cGMP production activities. We announced additional agreements with Thermo Fisher Scientific and with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, established contract manufacturers that specialize in gene therapy and AAV vectors. We are using the baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells, originally invented and developed by several current and former members of our production team while at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, which we continue to improve upon. We believe that having oversight through these key relationships over our own commercial manufacturing process is critical to ensuring quality product with commercial yields.

● | Retain commercialization rights to our programs. We hold worldwide rights for our Huntington’s Program, ALS Program and our Tau Program. We have retained co-development and co-commercialization rights for the FA Program under our Neurocrine Collaboration, and we will recover worldwide rights for the VY-AADC Program as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. As these and other programs advance through late-stage clinical development, we intend to build our own sales and marketing infrastructure and leverage our partnerships to support our programs where we have retained

commercialization rights. Collaborations represent an important advance in our strategy to leverage our AAV gene therapy platform and programs through collaborative partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies that bring complementary expertise, capabilities, and experience, in addition to capital.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our intellectual property portfolio. We seek to have an industry leading intellectual property portfolio. To that end, we seek patent rights for various aspects of our programs, including vector engineering and construct design, our production process, and all features of our clinical products including compositions and methods of delivery. We expect to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by aggressively seeking patent rights for promising aspects of our gene therapy platform and product candidates.

AAV Gene Therapy for Neurological Diseases
Gene therapy is an approach whereby gene expression is directly altered in patients to address the underlying cause or predominant manifestations of disease. We believe that the targeted nature of gene therapy may enable powerful treatment options and provide these patients with meaningful and durable benefits. 



While AAV gene therapy can potentially be harnessed for multiple treatment methods, we are currently focused on gene replacement, gene knockdown and vectorized antibody approaches. Gene replacement is intended to restore the expression of a protein that is not expressed, expressed at abnormally low levels or functionally mutated with loss of function. Gene knockdown, or gene silencing, is intended to reduce the expression of a pathologically mutated RNA or protein that has detrimental effects. Vectorizing an antibody for delivery using AAV has the ability to increase exposure of large antibodies in brain parenchyma that otherwise cannot cross the blood-brain barrier in any meaningful way when administered passively. 
Our gene therapy approach uses AAV vectors which we believe are ideal vectors for gene therapy for several reasons: 
Broad Applicability. AAV is able to transduce, or transfer a therapeutic gene, into numerous cell types including target cells in the CNS. 
Safety. We believe AAV is safe and is not known to cause any disease in humans. 
Does Not Readily Integrate. AAV does not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, reducing the potential for oncogenesis, or the induction of cancer.
Scalability. AAV is able to be manufactured at commercial quality and scale. 
We believe that neurological diseases are well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy for the following reasons: 
Validated Targets. Many neurological diseases are caused by well-defined mutations in genes and these genes represent genetically validated drug targets for AAV gene therapy. 
Targeted Delivery. We believe advances in delivery techniques allow for direct delivery of AAV vectors to discrete regions in the brain, broader delivery throughout the spinal cord via the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, or systemically in conjunction with our novel capsids. 
Durable Expression. Long-term gene expression may be achievable in the CNS following one-time dosing and transfer of the therapeutic gene with an AAV vector. Neurons in the CNS are terminally differentiated, or no longer divide, eliminating the potential for cell division to dilute expression of the therapeutic gene. Repeated or continual dosing with direct injection of drugs into the CNS is complex, therefore a one-time AAV gene therapy has significant advantages. 
Immune Privileged Site. There is a reduced risk of harmful immune response or reduced efficacy due to localized delivery in a self-contained system. 

12



We are currently focused on gene replacement, gene knockdown, and vectorized antibody approaches, and we are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods such as gene editing to correct or delete a gene in the cell genome. 
The Voyager Gene Therapy Platform
We have built a gene therapy platform that we believe positions us to be the leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and severe neurological diseases. Our team of experts in the fields of AAV gene therapy and neuroscience first identifies and selects severe neurological diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors for delivery of the virus payload to the targeted tissue or cells. Finally, we leverage established routes of administration and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV gene therapies to target cells that are critical to the disease of interest either directly with targeted infusions to discrete regions of the brain, the spinal cord, or systemically. We believe that optimizing each of these parameters is a key factor for overall program success. We expect that our current and future pipeline programs will make use of technological advances generated with our gene therapy platform. 
Disease Selection 
We assess potential product programs based upon the following criteria: 
Unmet Need. There is a significant unmet medical need for the indication and substantial commercial potential. 
Target Validation. There is strong evidence that expression of a specific gene or protein, or lack thereof, is causing, or critical to, the disease state. 
Delivery Using AAV. There is strong evidence supporting the ability to target the relevant tissue and cells using an AAV vector to achieve sufficient target gene expression. 
Clinical Readouts. The clinical impact of an AAV gene therapy can be clearly measured, including through well-accepted clinical endpoints and the use of both existing and novel biomarkers. 
Scalability of Manufacturing. Sufficient AAV vector to supply late-stage clinical development and commercialization can be manufactured. 
In addition to the criteria above, we also look for groups of diseases where our knowledge can be transferred. For instance, we believe that some of the delivery parameters and imaging techniques that are employed in the VY-AADC Program can be applied to AAV gene therapy delivery for Huntington’s disease or other diseases where direct, targeted delivery to the brain is warranted. 
Vector Engineering and Optimization
We have advanced or intend to advance our multiple preclinical programs towards selection of lead clinical candidates using AAV vectors that we believe are best suited for each of our programs either through use of our existing capsids, through exercising a non-exclusive worldwide commercial license to capsid sequences covered by third parties, or by engineering or optimizing novel capsids. The key components of an AAV vector include: (i) the capsid; (ii) the therapeutic gene, or transgene; and (iii) the promoter, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene. 
Members of our team have co-discovered many of the known naturally occurring AAV capsids and have also created promising genetically engineered AAV capsids. Genetically engineered capsids have yielded vectors with desirable properties, such as higher biological potency and enhanced tissue specificity. We believe that there is an opportunity to further optimize AAV capsids to confer desired characteristics relating to properties such as tissue specificity and immunogenicity. We have a significant effort dedicated to designing and screening for novel AAV capsids using a number of different scientific approaches. We believe that the information generated by this work will enhance our ability to rationally design AAV capsids with specific properties for particular therapeutic applications. For example, we have identified several capsids that demonstrate significantly higher blood-brain barrier penetrance than 

13



naturally occurring AAV capsids in preclinical experiments conducted to date, and we are evaluating the possibility of leveraging these novel capsids in current and potential programs. 
In early 2019, we presented on our discovery and development of AAV capsids that cross the blood brain barrier, or BBB, after IV administration with improved transduction of the brain and spinal cord and enhanced cellular specificity using libraries under the control of either the neuron-specific synapsin, or SYN, promoter or the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, promoter to apply selective pressure for capsid variants that transduce the cell type of interest. As part of that effort, our scientists have developed a proprietary system called TRACER (Tropism Redirection of AAV by Cell Type-Specific Expression of RNA) to facilitate the selection of AAV capsids with BBB crossing and cell-specific transduction properties for particular therapeutic applications. The TRACER system is a broadly-applicable, functional RNA-based AAV capsid screening platform that allows for rapid in vivo evolution of AAV capsids with cell-specific transduction properties in wild-type animals. Multiple capsid variants have been identified with significant improvement of central nervous system transduction and BBB-penetrant properties over AAV9 in both mouse and non-human primate models following IV administration after three rounds of selection. These capsids are now in advanced stages of characterization for deployment in our gene therapy development programs. We are also applying the TRACER system towards further capsid variant libraries and selection for tropism and transduction in additional cell and tissue types. We expect to present data concerning our experiments conducted with these novel capsids in non-human primates at a scientific conference and other presentations in the first half of 2021.
With respect to the target DNA delivered through AAV gene therapy, we are selecting promoters that we believe have the appropriate activity and tissue, selectively for our specific gene therapy programs. We are also designing transgenes to provide optimal expression once delivered to the targeted cells. 
Manufacturing at Commercial Quality and Scale 
The ability to produce high quality AAV vectors at commercial-scale is a critical success factor in AAV gene therapy. While at the NIH, former members of our production team invented and developed a baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, which we use and have continued to improve. This system has a number of attributes that we believe will enable high quality commercial-scale manufacturing, including: 
High Yield. A single manufacturing run at 500-liter scale can yield many thousands of doses of an AAV gene therapy. 
High Purity. A relatively high percentage of AAV vectors contain the therapeutic DNA, reducing the number of empty capsids compared to alternative manufacturing approaches. In addition, the baculovirus/Sf9 system eliminates the risk of introducing mammalian cell derived impurities. 
Scalability. This process has been reproduced at volumes ranging from 0.02 liters to 250 liters. We believe the existing process is scalable to substantially higher volumes. 
We have built a state-of-the-art process research and development production facility for manufacturing research-grade AAV vectors onsite at our Lexington, Massachusetts location. We have also established multiple contract manufacturing relationships with companies specializing in the manufacture of gene therapy and AAV vectors.
Optimized Delivery and Route of Administration
Identifying the optimal route of administration and delivery parameters for AAV gene therapy, such as infusion volume, flow rate, vector concentration and dose and formulation for a specific disease, are critical to achieving safe and effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted location in the CNS. We aim to develop clinically feasible protocols that yield reproducible results across patients. For the VY-AADC Program and Huntington’s Program, we are pursuing direct injection into the brain, called intraparenchymal injection. For our ALS SOD1 program and the FA Program, we are evaluating multiple routes of administration including injection into the CSF within the cerebrospinal space, called intrathecal injection, as well as intravenous injection, intraparenchymal injection, and other delivery alternatives.

V-TAG®-guided Intraparenchymal Injection to the Brain
The surgical approach that we are using for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) is similar, in some respects, to the stereotactic approach used for deep brain stimulation, or DBS, a marketed device-based treatment for Parkinson’s disease. One primary difference with our approach is the ability to assist the physician in visualizing the delivery of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) to the putamen using real-time, intra-operative MRI to avoid specific blood vessels to reduce the risk of potential hemorrhages during the surgical procedure and to maximize the coverage of the putamen. 
Investigators in the Phase 1b clinical trial, the separate Phase 1 posterior trajectory trial, and the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) used the real-time, intra-operative, MRI system called the ClearPoint System® from CLPT. However, not all neuro-surgical units within the United States utilize this system and may employ other neuro-navigational systems that are not compatible with real-time MRI imaging. 


Consequently, we developed V-TAG® as our device for use as a real-time, intra-operative, MRI-compatible device that can be used with other neuro-navigational systems for this and other surgical procedures. In July 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. In March 2019, we transferred our premarket notification (510(k)) clearance to CLPT and continue to work with CLPT on the manufacturing and clinical supply of the device. We believe that our experience gained from the VY-AADC Program can be applied to AAV gene therapy delivery for our Huntington’s Program and possibly other projects as well.

Overview of Our Pipeline
We have leveraged our gene therapy platform to assemble a pipeline of novel AAV gene therapies for the treatment of severe neurological diseases with high unmet medical need. Depending on the disease, our current AAV gene therapies will use a gene replacement, gene knockdown, or vectorized antibody approach. Our goal is to address the underlying cause or the predominant manifestations of a specific disease by significantly increasing or decreasing expression of the relevant proteins at targeted sites within the CNS.

Parkinson’s Disease: VY-AADC Program
Disease and VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) Overview 
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 1 million people in the United States and 10 million people worldwide. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine and its function. Dopamine is a chemical “messenger” that is produced in the brain and is involved in the control of movement. Some chemicals, like dopamine, are made from other chemicals by proteins called enzymes. Dopamine is made in the brain when the enzyme AADC (aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase) converts the chemical levodopa to dopamine. Levodopa, AADC, and dopamine are each present at normal levels in healthy people.
When dopamine levels decrease in the brain and there is no longer enough to control movement, the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease including tremors, slow movement or loss of movement, rigidity, and postural instability, may occur. When this happens, a doctor may prescribe a levodopa medication, which is converted into dopamine by AADC in substantially the same way that naturally occurring levodopa is converted to dopamine.
As Parkinson’s disease worsens, there is less AADC enzyme in parts of the brain where it is needed to convert levodopa to dopamine. Therefore, the amount of dopamine that is produced from each dose of levodopa medicine may be reduced. When this happens, patients’ motor function may worsen and a less predictable response to medications may occur.
The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS, is a standard and widely used four-part clinical rating scale for Parkinson’s disease that evaluates cognitive, functional, and motor deficits, as well as medication-related complications. UPDRS Part III measures motor function by physician examination. The UPDRS is conducted when patients are taking their Parkinson’s disease medications (referred to as “on” medication) and when patients are not taking their Parkinson’s disease medications (referred to as “off” medication). In addition, a patient-completed Hauser diary records the patient’s motor response over the course of several days as ON time when they have good mobility with or without non-troublesome dyskinesia, or uncontrolled, involuntary movement; OFF time when they have poor mobility; and ON time with troublesome dyskinesia when they have uncontrolled movements. As shown in the figure below, diary ON time decreases, while OFF time and dyskinesias increase as patients progress from the early honeymoon period into later stages of Parkinson’s disease. 
Our investigational gene therapy VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) is designed to put the AADC enzyme into brain cells where it can convert levodopa to dopamine. To do this, the AADC gene is delivered inside a transporter called “adeno-associated viral vector,” which we refer to as AAV, much like a letter that carries the instructions the brain needs to make the AADC enzyme with the AAV as the envelope that carries the letter.

Overview of Progression of Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
​
VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) Phase 1b Trial (PD-1101)
In 2014, the University of California, San Francisco, or UCSF, initiated an open-label Phase 1b clinical trial to optimize the development of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817). The IND for the Phase 1b trial was filed by UCSF in July 2013 and was transferred to us in October 2015. In November 2017, we completed enrolling this open-label, dose-escalating PD-1101 Phase 1b trial of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817). The trial included 15 patients with Parkinson’s disease and was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of escalating doses of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817). In this trial, one-time administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) led to improvements in patients’ motor function, and patients were able to reduce their daily levodopa and other Parkinson’s disease medications. To date, administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) has been well-tolerated. In patients treated in this trial, there have been no vector-related serious adverse events reported. 
Patients in three cohorts of five patients each were treated with a single administration of ascending doses of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) administered under MRI guidance to the putamen, a region of the brain associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson’s disease. The primary endpoints of this trial are safety and tolerability of the treatment. This trial incorporated three key design features: 

● | Use of real-time, intra-operative MRI system during surgery to assist the physician in visualizing the delivery of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) to the putamen and to avoid specific blood vessels during the surgical procedure, with the goal of reducing the risk of hemorrhages.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Larger infusion volumes designed to increase coverage of the putamen with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Higher concentrations of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) vector compared to the previously completed UCSF Phase 1 trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondary endpoints of this trial, which are being used to assess the potential pharmacologic activity of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), include UPDRS, AADC positron emission tomography, or PET imaging, quality of life, a patient-completed Hauser diary monitoring good ON time without troublesome dyskinesia, and a behavioral test using intravenous levodopa treatment to measure changes in a patients’ sensitivity to levodopa as well as endpoints to measure motor functions. 
We have completed enrollment and the three-year follow-up for PD-1101. Data demonstrated that VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) has been generally well-tolerated and that administration with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) improved patients’ motor function and quality of life as measured by standard scores and measures used in Parkinson’s disease trials. Cohort 1 patients received a single administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) at a concentration of 8.3×1011 vector genomes per milliliter, or vg/ml, using an infusion volume of up to 450 µL per putamen, or up to 900 µL per patient, for a total dose of 7.5×1011 vg. Cohort 2 patients received a single administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) at a concentration of 8.3×1011 vg/ml, using an infusion volume of up to 900 µL per putamen, or up to 1,800 µL per patient, for a total dose of 1.5×1012 vg. Cohort 3 patients received a three-fold higher vg concentration of 2.6×1012 with the same infusion volumes of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) similar to those received by Cohort 2 patients (up to 900 µL per putamen), for a total dose of up to 4.5×1012 vg.
Administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) has been well-tolerated in all fifteen patients treated in the three cohorts with no reported vector-related serious adverse events, or SAEs. Fourteen of the 15 patients were discharged from the hospital within two days following surgery. As previously reported, one patient experienced two SAEs: a pulmonary embolism or blood clot in the lungs, and related heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat. Investigators determined that these SAEs were most likely related to immobility during the administration of the product; consequently, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis has been added to the clinical trial protocol.
Patients enrolled in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 were:

● | On average, 58 years of age with a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis for an average of 10 years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Candidates for surgical intervention including deep-brain stimulation due to disabling motor complications despite treatment with optimal anti-Parkinsonian medication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At baseline, the average patient diary ON time without troublesome dyskinesia was 10.5 hours and, average diary OFF time was 4.6 hours; both diary measures were normalized to a 16-hour waking day.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Average UPDRS-III (motor function) on medication score was 13.5 and UPDRS-III off-medication score was 37.1; average UPDRS-II (activities of daily living) on medication score was 3.9 and UPDRS-II off medication score was 16.5. Patients in Cohort 3 entered the trial with more severe dyskinesia at baseline than patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 based on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, with a mean score of 30.2 for Cohort 3 compared with a mean score of 19.2 and 17.4 for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At baseline, patients were treated with optimal levels of multiple dopaminergic medications including, in many cases, amantadine for the treatment of dyskinesia, or uncontrolled or involuntary movements. Patients’ average amount of Parkinson’s disease medications at baseline was 1,526 mg of oral LEDs per day.

VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) Phase 1 Posterior Trajectory Clinical Trial (PD-1102)
In the PD-1102 Phase 1 clinical trial, we explored a posterior, or back of the head, trajectory administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) to the putamen, compared to a transfrontal, or top of the head, delivery approach used in Cohorts 1 through 3 of the PD-1101 Phase 1b clinical trial described above. A posterior approach better aligns the infusion of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) with the anatomical structure of the putamen, which reduces the number of trajectories needed and potentially reduces the total procedure time and increases the total coverage of the putamen. Administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) with this posterior approach has been well-tolerated in the eight patients treated with no reported SAEs. Most patients were discharged from the hospital the day after surgery. We have 

18



completed enrollment and continue to follow patients in PD-1102. This trial utilized the same dose concentration as Cohort 3 of our Phase 1b clinical trial at a higher volume, yielding a total dose of up to 9.0×1012 vg compared with a total dose of up to 4.5×1012 vg in Cohort 3. 
The PD-1102 trial included eight patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. On average the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in PD-1102 were generally consistent with the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in PD-1101. In PD-1102, patients were on average 57 years of age with a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis for an average of nine years, and all patients were not responding adequately to oral medications and were candidates for surgical intervention due to disabling motor complications. At baseline, PD-1102 patients’ mean good ON time was 9.1 hours and mean OFF time when they have poor mobility was 6.8 hours.
Administration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) with the posterior trajectory resulted in a mean coverage of the putamen of 54% and reduced the infusion time by approximately two hours (from a mean of 5.2 hours to a mean of 3.1 hours) compared to PD-1101. In PD-1102, treatment with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) increased mean AADC enzyme activity in the putamen as measured by PET using [18F] fluorodopa, which we refer to as 18F-DOPA PET scan, by 85%. AADC enzyme activity in the putamen as measured by PET using 18F-DOPA reflects the capacity of neurons in the brain to convert levodopa to dopamine.
Recent Results from VY-AADC (NBIb- 1817) Phase 1b Clinical Development
At the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Virtual Congress 2020 held in September 2020, we and Neurocrine presented the final three-year data on all three cohorts of the PD-1101 Phase 1b clinical trial, as well as two-year data from the PD-1102 Phase 1 clinical trial. The results demonstrated that a one-time treatment with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) showed sustained improvement in motor function including greater “ON” time without troublesome dyskinesia, improvement in the UPDRS, Part III scores, and reduction in the amount of Parkinson’s disease medications required. 
In the three-year data from PD-1101 trial, the one-time treatment with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) showed sustained reduction in diary “OFF” time by an average of -0.15 to -1.91 hours (from an applicable baseline ranging from 4.28 to 4.93 hours) and improved “ON” time without troublesome dyskinesia by an average of 0.26 to 2.23 hours (from an applicable baseline ranging from 10.32 to 10.46 hours) across the cohorts, in each case, as reported in validated self-reported patient diaries by 15 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) also showed sustained improvement in motor function after three years, as measured by UPDRS Part III off medication scores, by -10.2 to -19.0 points (from an applicable baseline ranging from 35.8 to 38.2 points) across the cohorts, per clinician assessment. Requirements for Parkinson’s disease medications were also reduced in cohorts 2 and 3, in levodopa-equivalent daily doses, by an average of 322.0 and 441.2 mg/day, respectively, from applicable baselines of 1507.0 and 1477.0 mg/day. 
Two-year data from seven patients in the PD-1102 trial showed that VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) reduced diary-reported “OFF” time by an average of 3.2 hours and increased diary-reported good “On” time by 2.1 hours (from applicable baselines of 9.3 hours and 6.6 hours, respectively). In this study, patients treated with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) showed sustained improvement in motor function after two years, with improved UPDRS Part III off medication scores of -12.0 points (from an applicable baseline of 34.4). Requirements for Parkinson’s disease medications were also reduced, in levodopa-equivalent daily doses, by an average of 439.5 mg/day from a baseline 1500.9 mg/day. 
Preliminary safety data from both trials suggest that VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) was generally well-tolerated, with no study drug-related serious adverse events reported. The most common adverse events reported were headache, hypoesthesia, and musculoskeletal pain for patients enrolled in PD-1101, and upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, and depression for patients enrolled in PD-1102.

VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) RESTORE-1 and RESTORE-2 Program 
In December 2017, we submitted an IND for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) to the FDA. As part of the IND application for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section included data demonstrating comparability between VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) using our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process and VY-AADC 

19



(NBIb-1817) produced using a mammalian cell system consisting of triple-transfection of HEK293 cells, which was used in our two Phase 1 clinical trials. Both were produced under cGMP. Our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process is designed for production of AAV vectors at clinical and commercial scale, with the potential for increased yields and efficient scalability compared with mammalian-based systems. We have demonstrated that this production platform change resulted in comparable vector quality and activity. VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) manufactured in our baculovirus/Sf9 system is being used in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. In June 2018, the FDA granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation for the VY-AADC Program gene therapy treatment, which provides for an enhanced level of interactions between the company sponsor and the FDA throughout the development program. The designation was based on our Phase 1b clinical data with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817)). The FDA has also granted fast-track designation for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817).
In December 2018, we announced randomization of the first patient in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, sham-surgery controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for the treatment of moderate to advanced Parkinson’s disease in patients with motor fluctuations. We received written feedback from the FDA, including FDA guidance received during the Type B meeting, that in a disease such as Parkinson’s, two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are suggested. Based upon feedback received from the FDA, we and Neurocrine amended the RESTORE-1 clinical trial protocol to support a future registration filing, if successful, for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in the United States. The protocol amendments included increasing the planned enrollment to approximately 85 patients from the previously planned 42 patients, and adjusting future enrollment in the trial to randomize patients 2:1 to VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) or sham-surgery, respectively, as compared to the previous 1:1 randomization. The eligibility criteria remained substantially the same: the trial is potentially available to patients who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease for at least four years, are not responding adequately to oral medications, and have at least three or more hours of OFF time during the day as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary. The protocol amendments were anticipated to facilitate enrollment and patient convenience. 
A dose of up to 3.6 x 1012 vg, which we refer to as the maximum total bilateral dose, was selected for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. This dose is between the maximum total vector genome doses administered in Cohorts 2 and 3 from PD-1101 when considering the higher volume administered with the posterior trajectory and vector produced using the baculovirus system.


The primary efficacy endpoint of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial is the mean improvement from baseline to 12 months in good ON time as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary at 12 months compared to sham surgery. Secondary endpoints include mean improvement in diary OFF time, other motor function and quality of life measures from the UPDRS (UPDRS-II and -III scores), assessments from the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, or PDQ-39, and patient’s global function as measured by the proportion of participants with improvement on the Clinical Global Impression, or CGI, score. The trial will also measure non-motor symptoms from the Non-Motor Symptom Scale, or NMSS, as well as safety. 
Changes in patients’ daily doses of oral levodopa and related medications will also be recorded. Biomarker data collected during the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial include measurements of the coverage of the putamen, the specific region of the brain targeted with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), and measurements of AADC enzyme expression and activity in the putamen measured by positron emission tomography using 18F-DOPA.
In November 2020, the sponsor medical monitor and surgical core requested that the DSMB for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, review certain patient MRI abnormalities observed in some clinical trial participants in the ongoing clinical trial. Following this review, the DSMB requested additional information about magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities observed in trial participants and recommended a pause in the dosing of patients in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial pending review by the DSMB of these additional data. The DSMB informed Neurocrine that patient screening could continue for the trial and that the trial should remain blinded. Trial sites participating in the RESTORE-1 clinical trial were not screening, enrolling, or dosing patients at the time of this DSMB request as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the DSMB’s recommendation to pause the dosing of patients, we and Neurocrine decided to delay the planned resumption of patient screening in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 

20



clinical trial until Neurocrine had submitted the required expedited IND safety report related to these matters and the DSMB was able to complete its evaluation. 
In December 2020, the FDA notified Neurocrine that it had placed a clinical hold on the RESTORE-1 clinical trial. In January 2021, the FDA informed Neurocrine of the information required to provide a complete response to the FDA in connection with the clinical hold. Information required by the FDA includes an assessment of how the investigational product may have given rise to the adverse findings, a mitigation plan to manage the adverse findings, and supportive data to justify that a favorable benefit/risk profile remains for the product. 
The DSMB met to review additional patient data in January 2021 and has characterized the MRI abnormalities observed in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial as having uncertain clinical significance. The DSMB requested that Neurocrine obtain and provide additional information on past and current patients in the VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) clinical program. The clinical implications of this observation are currently unknown and are being evaluated. 
In February 2021, Neurocrine notified us of its decision to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration with respect to the VY-AADC Program, effective August 2, 2021. The Collaboration Agreement remains in full force and effect for each other program thereunder. Upon the termination of the VY-AADC Program, the license granted by us to Neurocrine will expire, and we will regain worldwide intellectual property rights to the VY-AADC Program in accordance with the collaboration agreement. We intend to support Neurocrine, the study sponsor and IND holder, on ongoing matters related to the completion of imaging and clinical assessments requested by the DSMB and the provision of other information requested by the FDA for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. We plan to determine the potential path forward for the VY-AADC Program based on the additional information being collected by Neurocrine in response to the DSMB requests.
Huntington’s Program: VY-HTT01
Disease Overview 
Huntington’s disease is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive decline of motor and cognitive functions and a range of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances. The average age of onset is 39 years, with patients typically dying approximately 15 to 20 years following diagnosis. According to the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, Huntington’s disease affects approximately 30,000 patients in the United States. Huntington’s disease is caused by mutations in the huntingtin, or HTT, gene. Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that an individual is at risk of inheriting the disease if only one parent is affected. More than 200,000 individuals in the United States are at risk for inheriting the mutant gene from an affected parent. While the exact function of the HTT gene in healthy individuals is unknown, it is essential for normal development before birth and mutations in the HTT gene ultimately lead to the production of abnormal intracellular huntingtin protein aggregates that cause neuronal cell death. Currently, there are no approved treatments targeting the underlying cause of the disease and only one drug, tetrabenazine, has been approved for the treatment of the specific motor symptoms of Huntington’s disease. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treating Huntington’s disease. Since HTT gene mutations that cause Huntington’s disease are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach designed to knock down expression of the HTT gene. In addition, the targeted cells for treatment primarily reside in discrete regions of the brain - the striatum and the cortex - that can be targeted with AAV gene therapy delivered directly into the brain. The mechanism of action of VY-HTT01 is knockdown of HTT gene expression in neurons in the striatum and cortex, thereby reducing the level of toxicity associated with mutated protein in these brain regions, and slowing the progression of cognitive and motor symptoms. We believe that we can use the same surgical approach for this program that has been used for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) delivery to the brain, allowing us to leverage prior clinical experience. 

21



Preclinical Studies 
In 2015, we entered into the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration and granted Sanofi Genzyme exclusive options to license, develop and commercialize VY-HTT01 outside the United States and to co-commercialize VY-HTT01 in the United States, among rights to other programs. Accordingly, Sanofi Genzyme’s Huntington’s disease gene therapy program was combined with our efforts at that time. Our collaborators at Sanofi Genzyme had completed significant preclinical work focused on AAV gene therapy for Huntington’s disease. Sanofi Genzyme’s preclinical studies in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease demonstrated the safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapy targeting the knockdown of the HTT gene in the CNS. 


As shown in the figure below, using an AAV vector delivered directly to the CNS, HTT gene expression was observed to be reduced by over 50%, on average, in the treatment group as compared to the control group. No signs of toxicity were reported.

In addition, significant functional benefit was observed in the treatment group, as measured by the rotarod test to assess motor function, and the Porsolt Swim Test to measure depressive behavior in mice. In the figure below, both normal or wild type mice, and mice with the HTT mutation, or YAC128, were evaluated following treatment with either an AAV vector targeting the knockdown of the HTT gene, labeled as AAV2/1-miRNA-Htt below, or a negative control vector, labeled as AAV2/1-Null below. As expected, knocking down HTT in the control mice was observed to have no functional impact, whereas knocking down HTT in YAC128 mice was observed to have significant functional benefit.

VY-HTT01 is our clinical gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. VT-HTT01 is composed of an AAV capsid (AAV1) and proprietary transgene that harnesses the RNA interference pathway to selectively knock down, or reduce, levels of HTT messenger RNA.
The extent of HTT mRNA suppression (greater than 50%) and high precision and efficiency of primary microRNA processing in our preclinical studies supported the selection of our lead clinical candidate. Additionally, preclinical data in large mammals have demonstrated that a single intraputaminal administration results in robust knockdown of HTT in the putamen.
Additional preclinical delivery studies have further optimized the dosing paradigm. In late 2018 and early 2019, we presented results demonstrating significant reduction of HTT mRNA at five weeks post-dosing in adult non-human primates using an MRI-guided surgical delivery of VY-HTT01 and a novel delivery paradigm targeting both the putamen and thalamus. Targeting the thalamus in addition to the putamen leverages more extensive and more preserved neuronal pathways to the cortex than delivery to the putamen alone. In adult non-human primates, at five weeks post-dosing, this novel dosing paradigm with VY-HTT01 resulted in well-tolerated and significant suppression of HTT in the striatum and in cortical neurons, which are critical in the progression of disease.
Recently, in non-human primate studies, a single administration of VY-HTT01 was well-tolerated and resulted in robust and widespread knockdown of HTT mRNA and protein with knock-down stabilization between six and twelve months and widespread distribution of VY-HTT01 vector genome across the striatum and cortex. VY-HTT01 treatment demonstrated robust reduction of HTT mRNA and protein in the YAC128 and BACHD transgenic mouse models of Huntington’s disease, with significant improvements in motor function. We plan to present preclinical data from the IND-enabling studies at a medical conference and other presentations in 2021.
VY-HTT01 Program Status 
In June 2019, we and Sanofi Genzyme executed the Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, under the terms of which Sanofi Genzyme relinquished its rights to the Huntington’s Program, including its rights to the exclusive license options to the Huntington’s Program. As a result, we gained worldwide rights to the treatment program for Huntington’s disease.

23



In September 2020, we submitted an IND application to evaluate VY-HTT01 in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with Huntington’s disease. In October 2020, the FDA placed a clinical hold on our IND application pending the resolution of certain chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information requests. We have subsequently received written feedback from the FDA requesting additional information on specific CMC topics, including drug device compatibility and drug substance and product characterization, and plan to provide our complete response to the FDA in the first half of 2021. If we are able to resolve the clinical hold and obtain clearance of our IND application, we expect to initiate our clinical evaluation of VY-HTT01.
Friedreich’s Ataxia Program: VY-FXN01
Disease Overview 
Friedreich’s ataxia is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. The typical age of onset is 10 to 12 years, and life expectancy is severely reduced with patients generally dying of neurological and cardiac complications between the ages of 35 and 45. According to the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance, there are approximately 6,400 patients living with the disease in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the disease. 
Friedreich’s ataxia patients have mutations of the FXN gene that reduce production of the frataxin protein, resulting in the degeneration of sensory pathways and a variety of debilitating symptoms. Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must obtain a defective copy of the FXN gene from both parents in order to develop the condition. One healthy copy of the FXN gene, or 50% of normal frataxin protein levels, is sufficient to prevent the disease phenotype. We therefore believe that restoring FXN protein levels to at least 50% of normal levels by AAV gene therapy might lead to a successful therapy. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We are developing an AAV gene therapy approach that we believe will deliver a functional version of the FXN gene to the sensory pathways through intravenous injection. We think this approach has the potential to improve balance, ability to walk, sensory capability, coordination, strength and functional capacity of Friedreich’s ataxia patients. Most Friedreich’s ataxia patients produce low levels of the frataxin protein, which although insufficient to prevent the disease, exposes the patient’s immune system to frataxin. This reduces the likelihood that the FXN protein expressed by AAV gene therapy will trigger a harmful immune response. 
Preclinical Studies 
We initially conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates and achieved high FXN expression levels within the target sensory ganglia, or clusters of neurons, along the spinal region following intrathecal injection. More recently, we conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates with IV injection and achieved target FXN expression levels within sensory ganglia and the heart. The levels of FXN expression observed using an AAV vector were, on average, greater than FXN levels present in control normal human brain tissue. FXN expression was also observed in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, another area of the CNS that is often affected in Friedreich’s ataxia, and that is often considered difficult to target therapeutically. 
Our Program Status 
As part of the Neurocrine Collaboration, we are developing VY-FXN01 for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia. VY-FXN01 is currently in preclinical development. We and Neurocrine are in the process of identifying a lead candidate that will comprise a capsid, promoter, and FXN transgene. We are completing AAV capsid biodistribution experiments to confirm capsid serotypes that effectively transduce disease target tissues in non-human primates following intravenous injection. Criteria for evaluating these capsids include safety, the overall level of transgene expression achieved, and the anatomic and cellular distribution of the transgene expression. Also, we have optimized the promoter for VY-FXN01 to achieve an acceptable therapeutic index for frataxin replacement. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of our vectors, we 

24



have conducted testing in a new genetic mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia. In this preclinical model of Friedreich’s ataxia, our gene therapy candidates durably improved sensory function and rescued the disease phenotype based on multiple functional tests. In physiological and behavioral assays, our gene therapy candidates demonstrated dose-dependent and durable responses for more than 10 months after a single administration, preventing central and peripheral disease progression. We also have a significant effort focused on better understanding the clinical course of Friedreich’s ataxia, identifying potential fluid biomarkers and selecting clinical endpoints for future clinical trials. If we and Neurocrine successfully identify a lead candidate for this program, we plan to complete IND enabling studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy.


ALS Program: VY-SOD102
Disease Overview 
ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to muscle atrophy, spasticity and weakness as well as impaired speech, swallowing and breathing, with many patients requiring ventilator support as the disease progresses. The average age of onset of ALS is 55 years, and median survival is approximately three years after initial symptoms appear. It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000 patients in the United States who are living with the disease. Familial, or inherited, ALS accounts for approximately 10% of ALS cases, and an estimated 20% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene. Therefore, there are an estimated 400-800 patients in the United States with ALS caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene. 
The normal function of the SOD1 protein is to catalyze the conversion of superoxide anion (O2-) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (O2). Mutations in SOD1 have been shown to lead to the formation of toxic aggregates of the SOD1 protein, resulting in the dysfunction and death of motor neurons. Patients with familial ALS caused by certain mutations in the SOD1 gene progress more rapidly than patients with other forms of ALS, although the reason for this more rapid progression is unknown. 
There are currently only two FDA-approved treatments for ALS, Riluzole by Sanofi, which has been shown to have only modest efficacy, prolonging life by a few months, and Edaravone, which has been shown to slow decline of daily functioning. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treating monogenic ALS caused by SOD1 mutations. Since the SOD1 gene mutations that cause ALS are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach that targets the knockdown of SOD1 gene expression. In addition, the primary target cells - motor neurons - reside within the spinal cord, which we believe can be effectively transduced with AAV gene therapy through intraparenchymal injection as well as other routes of administration. The mechanism of action of VY-SOD102 is knockdown of SOD1 expression in motor neurons, thereby potentially reducing the level of toxicity associated with mutated protein, and slowing functional decline and prolonging ventilator-independent survival. 
We believe that there is also the potential to leverage our approach for the treatment of other genetically defined forms of ALS. 
Preclinical Studies Targeting SOD1 for Monogenic ALS 
Results from our preclinical studies using intraparenchymal delivery of AAV vector to the spinal cord support targeting mutant SOD1 for the treatment of monogenic ALS. In the mini-pig, used as an animal model as it has a spinal cord similar in size to the human spinal cord, significant knockdown of SOD1 expression was observed following intraparenchymal spinal cord injection of an AAV vector carrying a transgene designed to inhibit SOD1 expression. This novel delivery approach with VY-SOD102 reduced SOD1 mRNA in the spinal cord on average by 70% and 50% in the 

25



cervical and thoracic regions, respectively, both regions critical for respiratory function, and 82% near the site of cervical injection. In addition, VY-SOD102 reduced SOD1 mRNA by 22% in the lumbar region. 


The knockdown of SOD1 has also been reported to provide significant survival benefits in animal models of ALS. As shown in the example below, mice with a SOD1 mutation treated with an AAV vector to knock down expression of the mutant human SOD1 gene extended median survival by 87 days compared to mice treated with a control vector.

----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These studies provide proof-of-principle for our approach to treating monogenic ALS due to SOD1 mutations with VY-SOD102. 
Our Program Status 
In late 2016, we identified VY-SOD101 as a lead clinical candidate after screening a series of capsids, microRNA expression cassettes, (a segment of DNA that contains the sequence that targets SOD1 gene expression selectively for knockdown), and encoded payloads. We screened more than 100 RNAi sequences, each represented by a 

26



bar in the graph below, and successfully identified multiple, highly-potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1, as highlighted by the yellow bars in the figure below: 
Overview of miRNA Target Sequences for Knockdown of SOD1
The most potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1 gene expression were evaluated in multiple microRNA expression cassettes and with a number of vector genome configurations. We have completed the necessary experiments to evaluate these potential lead candidates based upon criteria that include safety, selectivity, potency, and efficiency and precision of microRNA processing. 
In late 2017, we initiated additional preclinical studies to further optimize our ALS program’s therapeutic approach, including exploration of additional routes of administration and novel AAV capsids in large animal models. Based on these studies, we selected VY-SOD102 as our lead candidate. VY-SOD102, our clinical candidate for the treatment of a monogenic form of ALS, is composed of an AAV capsid and a proprietary transgene that harnesses the RNA interference pathway to selectively knock down, or reduce, levels of SOD1 mRNA. VY-SOD102 has the potential to durably reduce the levels of toxic mutant SOD1 protein in the spinal cord to slow the progression of disease. In late 2018 and early 2019, we presented data on VY-SOD102 administered with a novel delivery paradigm comprising a one-time infusion after laminectomy to the cervical region of the spinal cord. Preclinical data previously reported included significant reductions of SOD1 mRNA throughout the spinal cord of the Göttingen mini-pig, which has a spinal cord similar in length and diameter to the human spinal cord. This novel delivery approach with VY-SOD102 yielded well-tolerated and significant reduction of SOD1 mRNA throughout the spinal cord at four weeks post-dosing. In June 2019 in connection with the restructuring of our gene therapy relationship with Sanofi Genzyme, we decided to reallocate resources to our Huntington’s Program and new discovery efforts. We may seek a partner to advance our preclinical program for SOD1 prior to filing an IND application for advancing VY-SOD102 into clinical development. We are currently conducting preclinical studies to generate data with VY-SOD102 in non-human primates with alternative routes of administration. 
Tau Program
Disease Overview
In healthy individuals, tau is an abundant soluble cytoplasmic protein that binds to microtubules, which are key structural proteins in cells, to promote their stability and function. In Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, tau aggregates and forms insoluble tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. The progressive spread of tau pathology along distinct anatomical pathways in the brain closely correlates with disease progression and severity in a number of tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease, FTD, and PSP. In addition, mutations in the tau gene have been shown to cause inherited forms of tauopathies, including FTD and PSP. Because the extent of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies closely correlates with the severity of neurodegeneration, synapse loss, and cognitive 

27



deficits, attempts to prevent, reduce, or slow the development of tau pathology have become important therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
In previous preclinical studies in animal models, despite high weekly or biweekly systemic doses of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies administered over three to six months, only very low levels of antibody reached the brain, resulting in a modest reduction of tau pathology by ~40­–50%. This incomplete and modest reduction in tau pathology following treatment with very high and frequent systemic doses of these antibodies may pose therapeutic challenges in humans with various tauopathies. To address these limitations, our tau program attempts to develop AAV gene therapies to deliver monoclonal antibodies to the brain directed against tau as potential new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.
Our Program Status
The Tau program is currently in the preclinical stage. In February 2018, we entered into the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, for the research, development, and commercialization of AAV gene therapy products for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system and other neurodegenerative diseases related to defective or excess aggregation of tau protein in the human brain, including Alzheimer’s disease. The AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement was terminated in its entirety in August 2020. In connection with the termination, we were obligated to undertake certain transition activities, including transferring to AbbVie certain data and reports generated under, and any regulatory filing relating to certain compounds and product candidates investigated in the collaboration. All such activities were completed on or prior to September 30, 2020. As a result of the termination, we have been relieved of future research and development obligations under the collaboration. Exclusivity provisions restricting either party or any of its respective affiliates from directly or indirectly exploiting any vectorized antibody compound targeting a tau protein and restricting us, alone or jointly with any third party, from directly or indirectly exploiting specified antibodies targeting a tau protein were also terminated. Each party retains a royalty-free, exclusive license to the other’s interest in the Joint IP to exploit antibodies it contributed to the collaboration as well as a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to the Joint IP for any other purpose. Further, AbbVie has granted us, effective as of the AbbVie Collaboration Termination Date, a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (though multiple tiers), exclusive license to AbbVie’s interest in Joint IP to exploit research compounds or product candidates that were investigated under the collaboration and do not encode antibodies contributed by AbbVie or include active pharmaceutical ingredients owned by AbbVie or its affiliates, for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses. We are not obligated to repay the upfront payment it received from AbbVie in connection with entering into the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement but are no longer eligible to receive option payments, milestone payments or royalties thereunder.
Following the termination, we continue to advance the research and development efforts related to vectorized antibodies, including vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other virus vector genome that encodes one of more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein. We are currently evaluating our options for advancing these efforts individually or with other potential collaborators.
Future Programs 
We are evaluating additional severe neurological diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy through application of either a gene replacement or a gene knockdown approach and are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector. 
Collaborations and License Agreements
Neurocrine Collaboration
In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of certain of our AAV gene therapy products. Under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, upon the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of any required approvals or clearances including antitrust clearance, we agreed to collaborate on the conduct of four collaboration programs, which we refer to 

28



collectively as the Neurocrine Programs: the VY-AADC Program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, the FA Program for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia including the development of the VY-FXN01 product candidate, which together with the VY-AADC Program, we refer to as the Legacy Programs, and the Discovery Programs.

Collaboration and Licenses
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to the rights retained by us thereunder, we agreed to collaborate with Neurocrine on, and to grant, exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable, sublicensable licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights, for all human and veterinary diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses, for the research, development, and commercialization of gene therapy products, which we refer to as the Collaboration Products, under (i) the VY-AADC Program, on a worldwide basis; (ii) the FA Program, in the United States and, all countries in the world in which the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in effect with respect to the FA Program; and (iii) each Discovery Program, on a worldwide basis.

As a result of the June 2019 Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, we gained worldwide rights to the Huntington’s Program and ex-U.S. rights to the FA program. We subsequently transferred the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine pursuant to the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. To facilitate our transfer of the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine, we and Neurocrine amended the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and we received a $5.0 million payment from Neurocrine.
​
Pursuant to development plans to be agreed by the parties, which are overseen by a joint steering committee, or JSC, we have operational responsibility, subject to certain exceptions, for the conduct of each Neurocrine Program prior to the Transition Event for each Program, as described below, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the Collaboration Products. Neurocrine has agreed to be responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting these activities for each Neurocrine Program, in accordance with an agreed budget. If we breach our development responsibilities or in certain circumstances upon a change in control of us, Neurocrine has the right but not the obligation to assume the activities under such Neurocrine Program.
 ​
Upon the occurrence of a specified event for each Neurocrine Program, or a Transition Event, Neurocrine agreed to assume responsibility for development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for such Neurocrine Program from us and to pay milestones and royalties on future net sales as described further below. For each Legacy Program, we were granted the option, or a Co-Co Option, to co-develop and co-commercialize such Neurocrine Program upon the occurrence of a specified event, or a Co-Co Trigger Event. We agreed, upon our exercise of a Co-Co Option, to enter into a cost- and profit-sharing arrangement with Neurocrine, or a Co-Co Agreement, and (i) jointly develop and commercialize Collaboration Products for such Neurocrine Program, or Co-Co Products, (ii) share in its costs, profits and losses, and (iii) forfeit certain milestones and royalties on net sales in the United States during the effective period of the applicable Co-Co Agreement. The Transition Events are (i) with respect to the VY-AADC Program, our receipt of topline data for the ongoing RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817); (ii) with respect to the FA Program, our receipt of topline data for the initial Phase 1 clinical trial for an FA Program product candidate; and (iii) with respect to each Discovery Program, the preparation by us and the approval by Neurocrine of an IND application to be filed with the FDA by Neurocrine for the first development candidate in such Discovery Program. The Co-Co Trigger Events are (i) with respect to the VY-AADC Program, our receipt of topline data for the ongoing RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) and (ii) with respect to the FA Program, the achievement of milestones or metrics specified in the applicable development plan, as determined by the JSC.






Under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to exceptions specified, we and Neurocrine agreed that profits and losses under our Co-Co Option would be allocated (i) 50% to Neurocrine and 50% to us for a Collaboration Product from the VY-AADC Program and (ii) 60% to Neurocrine and 40% to us for a Collaboration Product from the FA Program; provided, however, that Neurocrine would have the right to elect, within a specified period following the acceptance for filing of a BLA from the FDA, to pay a $35.0 million rate-shifting fee to us to change the allocation for the VY-AADC Program to 55% to Neurocrine and 45% to us. The parties agreed that each Co-Co Agreement would provide us the right to terminate for any reason upon prior written notice to Neurocrine and Neurocrine the right to terminate in certain circumstances upon our change of control.

29



Governance
Our research and development activities under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement are to be conducted pursuant to plans agreed to by the parties, on a program-by-program basis, and overseen by the JSC, which is composed of an equal number of representatives from the parties. The JSC may delegate matters within its authority to subcommittees of the JSC. In addition, the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement establishes working groups to handle specified matters on a subject matter-by-subject matter basis. If a working group or subcommittee cannot agree on a matter within its purview within a specified time, such matter is to be referred sequentially to the JSC and then the executive officers of the parties. If the executive officers are not able to resolve the matter, then (i) with respect to each Legacy Program, subject to specified exceptions, (a) Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter prior to our exercise of our Co-Co Option with regard to such Co-Co Product or if such Co-Co Option expires or goes unexercised and (b) following the timely exercise by us of our Co-Co Option, depending on the subject of such matter, either Neurocrine, in certain instances, or the parties jointly or the JSC, in other instances, would have the right to resolve such matter, and (ii) with respect to Discovery Programs, subject to specified exceptions, Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter.
Candidate Selection
The parties have committed to agree on a list of up to eight target genes, or Targets, from which Neurocrine has the right to nominate Targets for the two Discovery Programs. The Targets nominated for the Discovery Programs must be approved by a consensus of the JSC or the executive officers. 
Manufacturing
Prior to the Transition Event for a Neurocrine Program, we are responsible for the manufacture of any Collaboration Products for the Program. Following the Transition Event, the parties shall negotiate the manufacturing and supply responsibilities, subject to the terms of any applicable Co-Co Agreement.

Financial Terms
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine has paid us an upfront payment of $115.0 million. In connection with the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine also paid us $50.0 million as consideration for an equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement provides for aggregate development milestone payments from Neurocrine to us for Collaboration Products under (i) the VY-AADC Program of up to $170.0 million; (ii) the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and (iii) each of the two Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million per Discovery Program. We may be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each Collaboration Product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestone payments across all Neurocrine Programs of $1.1 billion.



Neurocrine has also agreed to pay us royalties, based on future net sales of the Collaboration Products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (i) for the VY-AADC Program, from the mid-teens to thirty and the low-teens to twenty, respectively; (ii) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (iii) for each Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively. On a country-by-country and program-by-program basis, royalty payments would commence on the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product and terminate on the later of (a) the expiration of the last patent covering the Collaboration Product or its method of use in such country, (b) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product in such country and (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or the Royalty Term. Royalty payments may be reduced by up to 50% in specified circumstances, including expiration of patents rights related to a Collaboration Product, approval of biosimilar products in a given country or required payment of licensing fees to third parties related to the development and commercialization of any Collaboration Product. Additionally, the licenses granted to Neurocrine shall automatically convert to fully paid-up, non-royalty bearing, perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive licenses on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the Royalty Term applicable to such Collaboration Product in such country.

30



Intellectual Property
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and subject to specified exceptions therein, each party owns the entire right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made solely by its employees or agents in the course of the collaboration. The parties jointly own all rights, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made or invented jointly by employees or agents of both parties.
Exclusivity
During the term of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, neither party nor any of its respective affiliates is permitted to directly or indirectly exploit any AAV-based gene therapy products directed to a Target to which a Collaboration Product is directed, subject to specified exceptions, including the parties’ conduct of basic research activities.
​
Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement expires on the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire Royalty Term with respect to a Collaboration Product in all countries in the relevant territory or (ii) the expiration or termination of all Co-Co Agreements. Neurocrine may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program or country-by-country basis by providing at least (a) 180-day advance notice if such notice is provided prior to the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product to which the termination applies or (b) one-year advance notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product to which the termination applies. We may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to specified conditions, if Neurocrine challenges the validity or enforceability of certain of our intellectual property rights. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions. 

Upon termination in certain cases, Neurocrine has agreed to grant to us licenses to certain Neurocrine intellectual property, subject to a negotiation between the parties to establish royalty rates for use of such intellectual property. In the event of a breach by us with respect to a Neurocrine Program, if such termination were to occur after a Transition Event, then (i) if a Co-Co Agreement is in effect with respect to such program, Neurocrine can terminate the Co-Co Agreement for such program and we would no longer have co-development and co-commercialization rights with respect to the Collaboration Product and (ii) subject to any license agreements, Neurocrine would no longer have any obligations with respect to any Collaboration Products resulting from such program.
On February 2, 2021, Neurocrine notified us that it had elected to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement solely with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in full force and effect for each other program thereunder. As a result of the termination, as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, the license granted by the Company to Neurocrine thereunder regarding the VY-AADC Program shall expire and we shall regain worldwide intellectual property rights regarding the VY-AADC Program. The Company intends to support Neurocrine, the study sponsor and IND holder, on ongoing matters related to the completion of imaging and clinical assessments requested by the DSMB and the provision of other information requested by the FDA for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. We plan to determine the potential path forward for the VY-AADC Program based on the additional information being collected by Neurocrine in response to the DSMB requests.
License Agreement with University of Massachusetts
On January 30, 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Massachusetts, or UMass, pursuant to which UMass granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain of its licensed patents to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import certain licensed products in the field of human diseases that use gene therapy applications. Our license is subject to any rights that may be required to be granted to the 

31



government of the United States, and UMass reserves the right to use the licensed patents for education and research and, with our consent, for non-commercial patient care, without the payment of any compensation to us. 
In consideration for rights granted to us under the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.2 million to UMass. We are obligated to pay UMass (i) low-single digit royalty payments based on net sales of the licensed products, (ii) annual maintenance payments of $30.0 thousand, which are creditable against royalties payable in such period, (iii) minimum aggregate annual royalty payments that are creditable against royalties payable in such period, with the minimum aggregate amount payable being in the low-six digits for each of the first four years of this agreement and a minimum aggregate amount payable being in the mid-six digits for each year, thereafter, (iv) milestone payments of up to $1.8 million, per licensed product for the first five licensed products, based on the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and (v) a percentage of sublicensing income that decreases over time from low double digit percentages to a mid-single digit percentage. We also agreed to reimburse UMass approximately $0.7 million for patent related expenses incurred by UMass as of the effective date of the agreement over a two-year period. 
Under the agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and to introduce such licensed products into the commercial market, and further agreed to certain development milestones. 
The agreement will terminate on the date that is the later of (i) seven years after the first commercial sale of the last licensed product under the agreement or (ii) such time as there are no valid claims covering a licensed product. We have the right to terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days prior written notice, and we and UMass have the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to cure a written breach within 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. 
MassBiologics and UMass Collaboration Agreement
On October 20, 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with UMass and MassBiologics, pursuant to which we shall (i) fund certain projects that will be conducted by UMass or MassBiologics, (ii) fund certain educational programs of UMass, including post-doctoral research at our laboratories beginning in 2015 and an annual lecture series beginning in 2015 and (iii) collaborate with MassBiologics to establish scalable processes for manufacturing recombinant AAV vector products using cGMP. 
In November 2014, we agreed to the first project under this agreement whereby we funded approximately $2.9 million over a 16-month period for certain research and development services performed by MassBiologics. The project commenced in January 2015 and completed during 2016. We and UMass and/or MassBiologics may agree to conduct other projects in the future, the terms of which will be agreed upon at such time. 
This agreement will remain in effect for a period of five years and automatically renews for additional one-year periods. Either party has the right to terminate this agreement, once in each renewal period, for any reason upon providing the other party with 90 days written notice or in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that is not cured within 60 days of written notice. 
We will own all intellectual property rights generated under this agreement, either by our employees, UMass and/or MassBiologics employees, or jointly by our employees and UMass and/or MassBiologics employees, that cover AAV materials. We and UMass and/or MassBiologics, as applicable, will jointly own any intellectual property rights generated under this agreement jointly by our employees and the employees of UMass and/or MassBiologics, as applicable, that do not cover AAV materials. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop into products and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our gene therapy platform, product programs, product candidates and scientific expertise in the fields of 

32



gene therapy and neuroscience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
Manufacturing 
The manufacture of gene therapy products is technically complex, and necessitates substantial expertise and capital investment. Production difficulties caused by unforeseen events may delay the availability of material for our clinical studies. To meet the requirements of our current and planned future trials we have developed a proprietary manufacturing platform that provides a robust and scalable process for AAV production. We are using the baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells. We focus on developing internal processes and capabilities to produce high-yield and high-quality gene therapies. The process has been successfully transferred to our contract manufacturing organizations where it is used in manufacturing of clinical materials in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP. We have entered into agreements with Thermo Fisher Scientific and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies to further expand our manufacturing capabilities to support the development of our gene therapy programs. We have also built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at laboratory and pilot scale.
We presently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our program materials. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.

whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, improve and maintain the strength of our position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. 
We have 368 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 29 patent applications have been filed and are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 82 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 117 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us non-exclusive license rights to the technology with 40 applications pending. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods of designing novel AAV constructs, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are licensed by FDA for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 

38



FDCA. Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA clearance must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT) is responsible for gene therapy review and evaluation. CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, viral shedding, environmental assessments, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. FDA guidance documents provide the agency’s current thinking about a particular subject but are not legally binding. 
U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with cGMPs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, assessing the safety of the clinical research and identifying any potential risk to public health or the environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

39




● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues and including a vote by external Committee members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, and payment of associated user fees; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical tests, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. Previously, when a gene therapy study was conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation was to be submitted to and the study was registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines was mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines had voluntarily followed them. Under an FDA and NIH proposal in 2018, the role of the RAC, in reviewing gene therapy protocols would be entirely eliminated and sponsors would no longer be required to submit reports to NIH on such protocols. Going forward, NIH says the RAC will continue to function as an advisory board to NIH on emerging fields such as gene editing, synthetic biology and neurotechnology. 
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including recent final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for gene therapy INDs, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders as well as draft guidance in January 2021 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although the FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.

40



The IND and IRB Processes
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA requests certain changes to a protocol before the study can begin, or the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
Clinical Trials in Support of a Marketing Application
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic (or both) nucleic acid molecules performed at or sponsored by an institution that receives any NIH funding for such research also must be reviewed by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

● | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Guidelines on clinical trials with gene therapy products issued by OTAT state that the FDA has determined that the benefit-risk ratio of these products does not warrant their evaluation in healthy human subjects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

41



Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the European Union and other countries.

Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.



When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not 

42



interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.

Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Congress amended the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Under the amended section 505B, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral is required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an application or supplement to an application.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA, must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved 

43



application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2021 is $336,432. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The application also needs to be published and submitted in an electronic format that can be processed through the FDA’s electronic systems. If the electronic submission is not compatible with FDA’s systems, the BLA can be refused to file. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
Finally, for a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with good tissue practices, or GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidance that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. 

44



The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional non-clinical testing as a Phase 4 commitment. 
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
Post-Approval Requirements 
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Following approval, the manufacturing facilities are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA’s biologics team and such inspections may result in an issuance of FDA Form 483 deficiency observations or a warning letter, which can lead to plant shutdown and other more serious penalties and fines. Prior to the institution of any manufacturing changes, a determination needs to be made whether FDA approval is required in advance. If not done in accordance with FDA expectations, the FDA may restrict supply and may take further action. Annual product reports are required to be submitted annually. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. Systems need to be put in place to record and evaluate adverse events reported by health care providers and patients and to assess product complaints. An increase in severity or new adverse events can result in labeling changes or product recall. Defects in manufacturing of commercial products can result in product recalls. 
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

45



Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, less any time the applicant failed to act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
Market and Data Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2021, the FDA has approved 29 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.














Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.





Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are 

47



disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has ODD receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as not being able to supply the product for patients or showing clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In particular, the concept of what constitutes the "same drug" for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies, and the FDA has issued draft guidance suggesting that it would not consider two gene therapy products to be different drugs solely based on minor differences in the transgenes or vectors. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including both the Reference Product and Orphan Drug Exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. Thus, pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA—namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the 12-year period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application.
Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.




In addition, the ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, in addition to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 included in the ACA, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.

48



Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA. Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Oral argument in the case took place on November 10, 2020. On February 10, 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew DOJ’s support for this lawsuit. A ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court is expected sometime in 2021. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. To those ends, President Trump issued several Executive Orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products. It is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration. Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers. The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products). 
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription product and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 

49



Additional Regulation 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.

Review and Clearance of Companion Diagnostics in the United States 
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.
The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.

If FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device or delivery device (combination product) is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic or delivery device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic or delivery device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s CDRH Office.







Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing

clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. 

The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to fees for medical device product review. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee for review of a PMA is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414. 
A 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (i) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (ii) has different technological characteristics, and (a) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (b) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. On July 23, 2018, the CDRH of the FDA cleared the 510(k) for our V-TAG® device that is compatible for use with MRIs. 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials, e.g., a clinical trial application for each clinical trial for each EU country in which the trial is conducted; a clinical trial notification is required in Japan. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement for Biopharmaceutical Products 
Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
