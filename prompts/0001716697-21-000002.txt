ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
First Choice Bancorp, a California corporation, was organized on September 1, 2017 to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Choice Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. On December 21, 2017, the Bank received requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals for the Bank to reorganize into the holding company form of ownership pursuant to which the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Choice Bancorp. We are regulated as a bank holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Bank is regulated by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the “DFPI”) and, as a member bank, by the Federal Reserve. 
Our headquarters is located at 17785 Center Court Drive N., Suite 750, Cerritos, California 90703, and our telephone number at that location is (562) 345-9092. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the trading symbol of “FCBP” on May 1, 2018.
Acquisition and Expansion
    Effective July 31, 2018, we acquired Pacific Commerce Bancorp ("PCB") and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Pacific Commerce Bank, by merger in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of PCB have been included in the consolidated financial statements from August 1, 2018. 

Business of the Bank
The Bank was incorporated under the laws of the State of California in March 2005, is licensed by the DFPI, and commenced banking operations in August 2005 as a California state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Cerritos, California. The Bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary, PCB Real Estate Holdings, LLC, which was acquired as part of the acquisition of Pacific Commerce Bank and is used primarily to hold other real estate owned and other assets acquired by foreclosure. On October 1, 2018, the Bank became a state member bank of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, the Bank is subject to periodic examination and supervision by the DFPI and by the Federal Reserve as the Bank's primary banking regulators. In addition, the Bank's deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and, as a result, the FDIC has examination authority over the Bank.
The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals and businesses. Our primary market area is broadly defined as Southern California, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial Counties of California, with a particular focus on Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties. We operate eight full-service branches located in Alhambra, Anaheim, Carlsbad, Cerritos, Chula Vista, Downtown Los Angeles, Pasadena, and West Los Angeles, and two loan production offices located in Manhattan Beach and San Diego, California. We also maintain the brand name ProAmérica. 

Effective January 29, 2021, the Rowland Heights branch was sold to a third party financial institution who acquired certain branch assets and assumed certain branch liabilities, including deposit liabilities and the Bank’s obligations under the Rowland Heights branch lease. No loans were sold as part of this transaction. As of the date of sale, the Rowland Heights branch had total deposits of $22 million.

Strategy

Our strategic objective focuses on offering business-oriented loans and deposits products, financial solutions, and relationship banking services to customers throughout Southern California. Our value proposition is to provide a premier business banking experience through relationship banking by leveraging our depth of expertise, resources and the breadth of our products and services while maintaining disciplined credit underwriting standards and focusing on operational efficiency. We focus on originating high-quality loans and growing our deposit base through our relationship-based business lending. We pride ourselves on being “First in Speed, Service and Solutions.” 
Marketing Strategy

Our products and services are targeted to small- and medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations, business owners and entrepreneurs, and the professional community, including attorneys, certified public accountants, financial advisors, healthcare providers and investors, who desire personalized services of a local bank and access to top-level decision makers who know the individual community. The small- to middle- business market, generally defined as companies with revenues of less than $50 million, is our primary commercial banking target. At December 31, 2020, our capital enabled us to provide unsecured loans (defined as a loan not secured by a first deed of trust on real estate or cash collateral) and secured loans (defined as a loan secured by a first deed of trust on real estate or cash collateral) to a single borrower up to a maximum of $34 million and $56 million, respectively. 

We are locally-owned and operated, with a management team and Board of Directors charged with monitoring the financial needs of our communities and, as such, we are in a position to respond promptly to the requirements of potential new customers, as well as the changing needs of our existing customers.

Our strategy includes attracting and retaining experienced and proven bankers as relationship managers who are familiar with our market area, along with a full offering of products. This provides each of our customers with access to a strong trusted advisor, who can offer knowledgeable advice and an extensive suite of products, including the advanced treasury management products and specialized personnel for non-deposit products. Our approach is to staff offices with experienced bankers who are familiar with the area and preferably live or have worked in the area.
Products Offered

We offer a full array of competitively priced commercial loan and deposit products, as well as other services delivered directly or through strategic alliances with other service providers. The products offered are aimed at both business and individual customers in our target market.
Loan Products

We have a diversified mix of business loans primarily encompassing the following loan products: (i) construction and land development loans; (ii) residential real estate loans for business investment; (iii) real estate loans for owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial property; (iv) commercial and industrial loans and (v) U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans, guaranteed in part by the U.S. Government. 
Beginning in April 2020, we participated in the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), to provide loans to qualifying small business borrowers to assist them in paying eligible operational expenses, including payroll expenses. PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Beginning in July 2020, we participated in the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending program to offer non-forgivable loans to eligible borrowers. Loans originated under the program have a five-year repayment term, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 3%, interest payments are deferred for one year and principal payments are deferred for the first two years. The borrower must repay 15% of principal in the third and fourth years, and the remaining 70% is due in the final year. The program expired on January 8, 2021. 
In addition, we occasionally offer lines of credit, secured by a lien on real estate owned by our clients (or their principals), which may include their primary personal residence. However, such lines of credit generally are requested to accommodate the business and investment needs of that customer segment. 
We encourage relationship banking, obtaining a substantial portion of each borrower’s banking business, including deposit accounts. We will engage in transactional-based lending only for borrowers with strong sponsorship characteristics, experience and historical repayment performance. We do not originate residential mortgage loans. We may, from time to time, acquire single-family residential loans. At December 31, 2020, loans held for investment, net, totaled $1.86 billion.

Construction and Land Development Loans. We originate interim land and construction loans for commercial purposes, including hospitality and speculative residential. Land loans are primarily to allow the borrower time to complete entitlements or as bridge financing prior to construction. We also provide new construction and renovation loans. Land and construction loans are generally limited to experienced and financially supportive sponsorships, known to management, and in markets that support the development. We impose limits on the loan amount for land, acquisition and construction loans based on loan-to-cost ratios and loan-to-value ratios based on "as-is" and "as completed appraisal." Our loan-to-cost policy limits are typically 70% or less and loan-to-value limits are typically 65% or less based upon an as-completed basis for construction. There were no non-performing construction and land development loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no construction and land development loans on payment deferral at December 31, 2020. 
The following table presents the components of our construction and land development portfolio at the periods indicated: 

 | December 31, 2020 | | December 31, 2019
 | Amount | | % of Total | | Amount | | % of Total
 | (dollars in thousands)
Residential construction (single family 1-4 units) | $ | 78,628 | | | 39.78 | % | | $ | 86,798 | | | 34.79 | %
Commercial real estate construction | 64,228 | | | 32.49 | % | | 115,769 | | | 46.40 | %
Land acquisition & development | 54,778 | | | 27.73 | % | | 46,937 | | | 18.81 | %
Total construction and land development loans | $ | 197,634 | | | 100.00 | % | | $ | 249,504 | | | 100.00 | %


Real Estate Loans - Residential. We purchased residential real estate loans within our market that had been originated by unaffiliated third parties. We took a comprehensive and conservative approach to mortgage underwriting. These loans were carefully selected and audited by third parties for compliance with all applicable mortgage regulations. The typical loan is a five-year hybrid adjustable rate mortgage with an initial rate in the range of between 4.0% and 6.6%, which re-prices after five years to the one-year LIBOR plus a specified margin. As of December 31, 2020, our residential real estate portfolio had an average loan-to-value of the portfolio of 50%. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $27.7 million and $43.7 million of single-family residential real estate loans, representing 1.5% and 3.2% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts. There was one non-performing single-family residential real estate loan of $254 thousand, or 0.92% of the total single-family residential real loans at December 31, 2020. There were no non-performing single-family residential real estate loans at December 31, 2019. There were no single-family residential real estate loans on payment deferral at December 31, 2020.

Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") Loans. We originate commercial property and occasionally multi-family loans, principally within our market for both owner-users and investors. Typically, these loans are held in our loan portfolio and collateralized by the underlying property. The property financed must be supported by current appraisals at the date of origination and other relevant information, and the loan underwriting is managed with a loan-to-value policy limit between 65% and 75%, an in-house guidance limit of 65%, and minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25x. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as office buildings, warehouses and production facilities, hospitality properties (such as hotels and motels), mixed-use residential and commercial, retail, commercial land and multi-family properties.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, CRE loans totaled $712.6 million and $595.4 million, representing 37.7% and 43.3% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts. This includes $550.8 million and $423.8 million of CRE loans secured by non-owner occupied properties and $161.8 million and $171.6 million of CRE loans secured by owner occupied properties at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Non-performing CRE loans totaled $2.8 million and $4.4 million, or 0.39% and 0.74% of total CRE loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no CRE loans on payment deferral at December 31, 2020.
Commercial and Industrial ("C&I") Loans. Our C&I loans are generally made to businesses located in the Southern California region and surrounding communities whose borrowing needs are generally $10.0 million or less. These loans may be secured by a deed of trust on real estate or secured by a perfected commercial lien on non-real estate assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory or operating equipment. These loans may be revolving lines of credit, term equipment financing, amortizing or interest only, or lines of credit secured by general liens on accounts receivable, inventory or a borrower’s other business assets, which may include loans made to third parties. 
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, C&I loans amounted to $388.8 million and $309.0 million, representing 20.5% and 22.5% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts. We have non-performing C&I loans of $183 thousand and $229 thousand, which represented 0.05% and 0.07% of total C&I loans, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, two C&I loans on payment deferral totaling $2.8 million were reported as non-accrual and none were reported as TDRs pursuant to Section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES") Act.

We also make loans that provide funding for executive retirement benefit programs. These loans are frequently secured by at least 90% of cash equivalent collateral, typically the cash surrender value ("CSV"), of one or more life insurance policies. The amount of the acceptable loan to CSV is dependent upon the credit quality of the insurer. A decline in the credit quality of the insurer would require the borrower to pledge additional collateral or substitute the CSV of one insurer for another or reduce the loan principal balance. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, these loans totaled $48.6 million and $49.7 million and the ratio of aggregate unpaid principal balance to aggregate CSV for this portfolio was 97.5% and 99.4%.

Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans. We are designated as a Preferred Lender under the SBA Preferred Lender Program. We have both a SBA 7(a) loan program, generally at variable rates, and a SBA 504 loan program, generally with an initial fixed rate for a term of between 5 and 7 years. We originate SBA 7(a) loans with the intention of selling the guaranteed portion as soon as the loan is fully funded and the guaranteed portion may be sold. The SBA 7(a) loan program provides up to a 75% guaranty for loans greater than $150,000, an 85% guaranty for loans $150,000 or less and, in certain circumstances, up to a 90% guaranty. The maximum SBA 7(a) loan amount is $5 million, with the exception of CARES Act PPP loans. The guaranty is conditional and covers a portion of the risk of payment default by the borrower, but not the risk of improper closing and servicing by the lender. The SBA 504 loan program is not guaranteed by the SBA, as there is a junior lien loan that is funded separately by the SBA. The SBA 504 loan program consists of real estate backed commercial mortgages where we have the first mortgage and the SBA has the second mortgage on the property. Generally, we have a less than 50% loan-to-value ratio on SBA 504 loan program loans at origination date. Our SBA 504 loans are typically made to manufacturing companies, wholesalers and retailers, hotels/motels, and other service businesses for the purpose of purchasing real estate, refinancing real estate, and property improvements or business equipment needs. SBA 504 loans can have maturities of up to 25 years. Typically, non-real estate secured loans mature in 10 years or less. In addition to real estate, collateral may also include inventory, accounts receivable and equipment. SBA loans are personally guaranteed. We generally sell the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans and often the senior lien portion of SBA 504 loans in the secondary market and, for certain loans, retain the servicing responsibility. Consideration for the sale includes the cash received as well as the related servicing asset. We receive servicing fees ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% for the services provided. The portions of the SBA 7(a) loans not sold but collateralized by real estate are monitored by collateral type and included in our CRE stress testing. Excluding PPP loans, our SBA portfolio represents 15.1% of total loans held for investment, net of discounts at December 31, 2020. 
SBA PPP Loans. We participated in the PPP and had gross outstanding balances of $326.7 million, or $320.1 million, net of deferred fees of $6.6 million at December 31, 2020. Borrowers who used the funds from their PPP loans to maintain payroll and pay for certain eligible non-payroll expenses may have up to 100% of their loans forgiven by the SBA. The SBA began approving forgiveness applications relating to PPP loans we originated in 2020 and making payments as forgiveness was approved in the fourth quarter of 2020. At December 31, 2020, approximately $73 million of PPP loans were forgiven by the SBA or repaid by the borrowers. Net deferred fees of $1.8 million was accelerated to income at the time of SBA forgiveness or borrower repayment. 
In 2021, we are participating in the First Draw and Second Draw PPP Loan Programs signed into law on December 27, 2020 as part of the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act ("Economic Act"), which was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (also known as "PPP Round 3"). Unless otherwise extended, PPP Round 3 is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2021. The maximum loan amount for First Draw borrowers is $10 million and is $2 million for the Second Draw borrowers. Like the 2020 PPP, loans originated in PPP Round 3 are fully guaranteed by the SBA and are subject to potential forgiveness by the SBA.

    Non-performing SBA loans totaled $3.3 million and $6.6 million, which represented 0.58% and 3.73% of total SBA loans, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. There was one SBA 7(a) loan of $542 thousand on payment deferral at December 31, 2020. 
 Main Street Lending Program. We participated in the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program in 2020. The program was intended to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, the Company originated loans to borrowers meeting the terms and requirements of the program, including requirements as to eligibility, use of proceeds and priority, and sold 95% participation interests in these loans to Main Street Facilities, LLC, a special purpose vehicle ("SPV") organized by the Federal Reserve to purchase these interests. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company originated 32 loans under the Main Street Lending Program totaling $172.2 million in principal and sold participation interests totaling $163.6 million to the SPV, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.1 million. The program expired on January 8, 2021.
Deposit Products

As a full-service commercial bank, we focus deposit generation on operating and transaction accounts, including noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand, and money market accounts. We also offer time deposits and savings accounts. We market deposits by offering the convenience of “online banking,” “remote deposit capture” products, and mobile banking technology, which allows checks to be deposited from a mobile device. We also offer “e-statements” which allows customers to receive statements electronically. To assist in our marketing efforts, we hire seasoned business development officers and focus on generating noninterest-bearing demand deposits.
Our ability to gather deposits, particularly low-cost core non-volatile deposits, is an important aspect of our business and a significant driver of franchise value as a cost efficient and stable source of funding to support our growth. At December 31, 2020, we had total deposits of $1.63 billion, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $820.7 million, or 50.2% of total deposits. This compares to $1.31 billion of total deposits, including $626.6 million of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, or 47.7% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019. Our total deposit cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.34% compared to 0.81% for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
    As of December 31, 2020, our 10 largest deposit relationships totaled $460.1 million, or 28% of total deposits; this compares to $370.9 million, or 28.2% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019. In addition, we have 109 deposit relationships with aggregate balances over $2 million, including our 10 largest depositors, which total $1.00 billion, representing 61% of total deposits at December 31, 2020.

For customers that want full FDIC insurance on time deposits in excess of $250,000, we offer the CDARS® program which allows us to place the time deposits with other participating banks to maximize the customers’ FDIC insurance. In December 2018, the FDIC issued a final rule under Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act that exempted well-capitalized and well-rated institutions for treating reciprocal deposits as brokered deposits up to the lesser of 20% of its total liabilities or $5 billion. At December 31, 2020, our Community Bank Leverage Ratio ("CBLR") of 10.28% qualified us as a "well-capitalized" financial institution. At December 31, 2020, our reciprocal CDARS® deposits totaled $25.1 million, representing 1.3% of total liabilities. We also had one-way CDARS® 
deposits which are considered brokered deposits. At December 31, 2020, our one-way CDARS® deposits totaled $16.5 million, representing 1.01% of total deposits. 
In addition to the CDARS® program, we offer the Demand Deposit MarketplaceSM ("DDM") program which provides additional FDIC insurance for customers with non-interest bearing or interest-bearing deposits. The deposits are processed through the DDM deposit network into other member banks in increments of less than the FDIC insured maximum in order to provide the customer full FDIC insurance coverage. We receive an equal dollar amount of deposits ("reciprocal deposits") from other DDM member banks in exchange for the deposits we place into the DDM network. These reciprocal deposits are considered non-brokered deposits and recorded as interest checking deposits and money market accounts in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020. The DDM reciprocal deposits totaled $165.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits. Generally, we limit the use of brokered deposits to long-term (maturity dates in excess of one year at the time of placement) and callable deposits. Because the deposits pay a fixed interest rate for a longer period of time, they provide us with protection against increasing deposit costs as a result of rising interest rates. Furthermore, because the deposits can be called by us, they also provide us with the ability to decrease deposit cost if there is a fall in market interest rates. During 2020, we also participated in the Insured Cash Sweep ("ICS") deposit program. Through this ICS deposit program, we have the ability to place deposits through the networks for which we receive no matching deposits ("one-way" deposits). These one-way ICS deposits are considered brokered deposits and recorded as interest-bearing non-maturity deposits in the consolidated balance sheets. Total brokered non-maturity deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $78.7 million and $48.1 million, representing 4.8% and 3.7% of total deposits. Total brokered time deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $101.1 million and $50.4 million, representing 6.2% and 3.8% of total deposits. 

We participate in the Time Deposit Program administered by the California State Treasurer. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, time deposits from the State of California totaled $10.0 million and $25.1 million. These deposits are included in our aforementioned 10 largest deposits. In connection with our participation in this program, we purchased $11.0 million and $27.5 million in letters of credit issued by FHLB as collateral at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Treasury Management Services. Treasury Management products play an integral role in growing our deposit base by providing our customers with the tools to bank efficiently and conveniently. These products and services are a critical component in attracting complex business and specialty deposit customers, such as 1031 Exchange companies, property management companies, developers, attorneys, accountants, manufacturers and real estate contractors that have specialized deposit service needs. The Treasury Management services we offer include automatic transfer (sweep) of funds between accounts, automated clearing house services (e.g., ACH origination, direct deposit, direct debit and electronic cash concentration and disbursement), commercial cash vault services, lockbox, zero balance accounts, current and prior day transaction reporting, bank statement retrieval, reconciliation services, fraud prevention tools and account analysis. 
Online Banking. We offer banking services online from our secure website – www.firstchoicebankca.com. Our online banking systems allow customers the ability to access their accounts 7-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day to obtain account information and complete many common transactions including electronic bill pay, data download, transfer funds, view images of canceled checks, view deposits, view account statements, issue stop payment requests, and transfer funds via Zelle® (available for consumer accounts only). Commercial online customers can view their accounts online, transfer funds internally, place stop payments, initiate wire transfers, initiate Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) debits and credits, pay state and federal taxes electronically, export information to Quicken®, QuickBooks®, or Excel Spreadsheets and utilize robust reporting tool features. We also offer ACH and Check Positive Pay antifraud services which allows a business to review their ACH debit transactions and their issued checks daily and then provides them with the ability to pay or reject any item.
    Mobile Banking. We offer mobile banking services to consumer and business customers. Our mobile banking applications allow customers to access their account information, make transfers, deposit checks, manage their debit card security and pay bills while on the go and from the convenience of their registered mobile device.

Remote Deposit. We also offer qualified commercial customers a remote deposit capture (“RDC”) product that allows businesses to process check deposits from the convenience of their location. 
Specialty Deposit Group.  Our Specialty Deposit Group was established to focus on banking large complex business customers. The dedicated service team manages new and existing specialty relationships and provides ongoing analysis, monitoring and support. Targeted specialty niches include but are not limited to escrow companies, 1031 exchange accommodators, contractor retention escrows, receivership, healthcare, and property management companies.

Other Services. In addition to a full complement of lending and deposit products and related services, we provide customers, through other providers, access to Automated Teller Machines (“ATMs”) using their Visa® EMV Debit Cards; bank-by-mail, courier services, domestic and international wires, credit cards and documentary collection. We reimburse customers for surcharges for any transactions conducted on another bank’s ATMs.
Market Area and Competition

Our primary market area includes the seven Southern California counties composed of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial. The economic base of the area is heavily dependent on small- and medium-sized businesses. Our relationship management team consists of experienced bankers involved with the business communities in their market areas. Their business development efforts are augmented by referrals from our Board of Directors and existing customers. The members of our management team, in particular, are well experienced in business lending, supporting middle-market banking needs, and generating value-added banking services to small- and medium-sized businesses.

The banking business in California is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits and is dominated by a relatively small number of major financial institutions with many offices operating over a wide geographic area, including institutions based outside of California. The increasingly competitive environment faced by banks is a result primarily of changes in laws and regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers and the emergence of non-regulated financial technology companies. We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, as well as with finance companies, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, money market funds and other non-financial institutions. Larger financial institutions offer certain services (such as trust services or wealth management) that we do not offer. These institutions also have the ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns. By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such institutions also have substantially higher lending limits than we have.

Our ability to compete is based primarily on our ability to develop a relationship, built upon customer service and responsiveness to customer needs. Our “preferred lender” status with the SBA allows us to approve SBA loans faster than many of our competitors. We distinguish ourselves with the availability and accessibility of our senior management to customers and prospects. In addition, our knowledge of our markets and industries assists us in locating, recruiting and retaining customers. Our ability to compete also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain our senior management and experienced relationship managers.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements and is exempted from certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company:
•we may present as few as two years of audited consolidated financial statements and two years of related management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;
•we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
•we are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
•we are not required to give our shareholders non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements relating to executive compensation and the number of years of financial information presented and, in the future, we may take advantage of any or all of these exemptions for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering which would be December 31, 2023, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt, and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In addition to the relief described above, the JOBS Act provided an optional extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have irrevocably opted to decline this 
extended transition period, which means that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as any consolidated financial statements that we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies.
Human Capital
    At December 31, 2020, we had 186 full time equivalent (“FTE”) employees. We have been named as one of American Banker's Best Banks to Work For by American Banker and Best Companies Group for the three most recent consecutive years, including 2020. 
We have assembled a diverse and experienced staff of dedicated and qualified professionals who are committed to delivering the highest levels of customer service. The majority of our senior management team has at least 15 years of banking experience, and several key personnel have more than 30 years of banking experience. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements with us. 
We believe that diversity encourages innovation and problem-solving, and our team's differences give us a competitive advantage. Our goal is to foster a culture in which those differences are valued and respected. We are proud of our cultural- and gender-diverse workforce, with a majority of our active employees identifying as ethnic minorities approximately 37% identify as Asian and 32% identify as Hispanic at December 31, 2020, and approximately 66% of our workforce and 43% of our executive management team are made up of women. In 2020, we appointed a female director to our Board of Directors (“Board”) and hope to continue to increase diversity on our Board to align with our culture of a diverse workforce. We have achieved this level of diversity and inclusion through concerted efforts to raise awareness about gender roles, religion, disability, ethnicity and sexual orientation and all other characteristics protected by federal, state and local laws, by using formal and mandatory training. We promote the fair inclusion of minorities, women and other protected classes in our workforce by publicizing employment opportunities, creating relationships with minority and women professional organizations and educational institutions, creating a culture that values the contribution of all employees, and encouraging a focus on these objectives when evaluating the performance of managers. In addition, we are certified as a Minority Depository Institution (MDI), as a majority of our Board of Directors are minorities and the communities we serve are comprised predominantly of ethnic minorities. 
As our workforce continues to grow, we know that diversity, equity and inclusion are the keys to ensuring we can continue to best serve our clients. Our focus is to support a culture of acceptance and to provide the necessary tools to all employees to be well-equipped for success, including ongoing diversity and leadership training, policies that support diversity and prohibit discrimination, continual implementation of innovative technology and an emphasis on teamwork. We believe our employees are our best asset, and investing in our people will help them and the Company to grow and thrive. 
In addition to the charities and community programs we support through donations, we have a dedicated volunteer time program that encourages our employees to volunteer with local charities and community organizations of their choice. We also provide opportunities for directors and employees to volunteer in support of local community development organizations and initiatives.
We are committed to providing our employees and customers with a safe environment in which to work and transact. Although the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges to maintaining employees and customers' safety we continue to be opened for business. We launched a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak that included an internal coronavirus resource page, we encouraged employees to work remotely where possible during the pandemic and reimbursed them for certain home office expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 60% of non-branch employees working remotely. We did not furlough or lay-off any employees as a result of the pandemic. We also provided free COVID-19 testing, expanded our leave policies and enhanced access to 401(k) funds. Our banking centers are open for business, while our online banking network is continuously available for digital banking transactions. 
Regulation and Supervision
    Banks and bank holding companies are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations.  Most banking regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of shareholders.  
    The following is a summary of certain statutes, regulations and regulatory guidance affecting the holding company and the Bank.  This summary is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes, regulations and guidance, all of which are subject to change in the future, nor does it fully address their effects and potential effects on the Company and the Bank.
Regulation of the Holding Company Generally
    The holding company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. As a bank holding company, it is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”) and, therefore, is subject to supervision, regulation and inspection by the Federal Reserve. The holding company is also subject to certain provisions of the California Financial Code which are applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, because the holding company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, it is subject to the SEC’s disclosure and periodic filing requirements as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol “FCBP” and, accordingly, we are also subject to the rules of Nasdaq for listed companies.
    The holding company is required to file annual reports and other information with the Federal Reserve regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, including securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and management advisory and data processing services, among others. 
    The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Acquisitions by the Bank are subject instead to the Bank Merger Act, which requires the prior approval of an acquiring bank’s primary federal regulator for any merger with or acquisition of another bank. Acquisitions by both the holding company and the Bank also require the prior approval of the DFPI pursuant to the California Financial Code.
    The holding company and the Bank are deemed to be “affiliates” of each other and thus are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as well as related Federal Reserve Regulation W which impose both quantitative and qualitative restrictions on transactions between affiliates. The Bank is also subject to laws and regulations requiring that all extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and related parties must, among other things, be made on substantially the same terms and follow credit underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank.
    A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must commit resources as necessary to support such subsidiaries. Under certain conditions, the Federal Reserve has the authority to restrict the payment of cash dividends by a bank holding company as an unsafe and unsound banking practice and may require a bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to purchasing or redeeming its own equity securities. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the holding company’s payment of dividends to the shareholders in such circumstances. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate the debt of bank holding companies.
    The holding company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Regulation Y, Appendix C) (the “Policy Statement”) and, therefore is not subject to consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Relief Act”) was signed into law. Among the Relief Act's key provisions are targeted tailoring measures to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks, including increasing the threshold for institutions qualifying for relief under the Policy Statement to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion (up from the prior $1 billion threshold). Under the Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies, such as First Choice Bancorp, have additional flexibility in the amount of debt they can issue and are also exempt from the Basel III Capital Rules. The Policy Statement does not apply to the Bank and the Bank must comply with the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the Prompt Corrective Action Provisions regulations as described below.
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) which addresses, among other issues, (i) corporate governance and disclosure issues, including the controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, (ii) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, (iii) auditing and accounting, (iv) forfeiture of bonuses and profits made by directors and senior officers in the 12-month period covered by restated financial statements, (v) a prohibition on insider trading during black-out periods, (vi) disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions, and (vii) accelerated share transaction filing requirements for officers and directors. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley increased penalties for non-compliance with the Exchange Act of 1934. SEC rules, promulgated pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley, impose obligations and restrictions on auditors and audit committees 
with the intention of enhancing their independence from management, and include extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules.
Regulation of the Bank Generally
As a state-chartered member bank, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations by the Federal Reserve and to state regulation by the DFPI. 
Community Bank Leverage Ratio. Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Growth Act”) directed federal banking agencies to draft regulations establishing a new CBLR pursuant to which banks and their bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9%, are eligible to opt into the CBLR framework. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital rules (generally applicable rule) and, if applicable, will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Accordingly, a qualifying community banking organization that exceeds the 9% CBLR will be considered to have met: (i) the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the generally applicable capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements in order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements. A qualifying community banking organization that elects to be under the CBLR framework generally would be exempt from the current capital framework, including risk-based capital requirements and capital conservation buffer requirements. A banking organization meets the definition of a “qualifying community banking organization” if the organization has:
•A leverage ratio of greater than 9%;
•Total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion;
•Total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than sold credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or less of total consolidated assets; and
•Total trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets.
Even though a banking organization meets the above-stated criteria, federal banking regulators have reserved the authority to disallow the use of the CBLR framework by a depository institution or depository institution holding company, based on the risk profile of the banking organization.
On April 6, 2020, the federal banking regulators, implementing the applicable provisions of the CARES Act, issued interim rules which modified the CBLR framework so that: (i) beginning in the second quarter 2020 and until the end of 2020, a banking organization that has a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and meets certain other criteria may elect to use the CBLR framework; and (ii) community banking organizations will have until January 1, 2022, before the CBLR requirement is reestablished at greater than 9%. Under the interim rules, the minimum CBLR will be 8% beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and 9% thereafter. The interim rules also maintain a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 1% below the applicable community bank leverage ratio.
The Bank has opted into the CBLR framework, beginning with the Call Report filed for the first quarter of 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Bank's CBLR was 10.28% which exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under the CBLR framework and the Bank was considered to be ‘‘well-capitalized.’’
Prompt Corrective Action Provisions. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more of the prescribed minimum capital ratios. As discussed above, a qualifying community banking organization, such as the Bank, that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital.
For community banking organization that do not qualify for, or qualify for but fall out of or do not opt into, the CBLR framework, the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories: “well capitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of 10%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 8%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 5%); “adequately capitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 4.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 4%); “undercapitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of less than 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 
6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4.5%; or Leverage Ratio of less than 4%); “significantly undercapitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 3%; or Leverage Ratio less than 3%); and “critically undercapitalized” (tangible equity to total assets less than or equal to 2%). A bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice merits a downgrade, but no bank may be treated as “critically undercapitalized” unless its actual tangible equity to assets ratio warrants such treatment. 

    At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations. For example, a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would cause the bank to be “undercapitalized.” Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks, which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements (including a guarantee by the parent holding company, if any). “Significantly undercapitalized” banks are subject to broad regulatory authority, including among other things capital directives, forced mergers, restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits, restrictions on asset growth and activities, and prohibitions on paying bonuses or increasing compensation to senior executive officers without FDIC approval. Even more severe restrictions apply to “critically undercapitalized” banks. Most importantly, except under limited circumstances, not later than 90 days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank.
    In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, termination of insurance on deposits (in the case of a bank), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or removal and prohibition orders against “institution-affiliated” parties.

    Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions. Those guidelines relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan underwriting and documentation, compensation, and liquidity and interest rate exposure. In general, the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an institution fails to meet the requisite standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and could institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or followed.
    The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Legislation and regulations enacted and implemented since 2008 in response to the U.S. economic downturn and financial industry instability continue to impact most institutions in the banking sector. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which was enacted in 2010, are now effective and have been fully implemented, including revisions to the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and a permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching; and, required disclosures and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Additional actions taken to implement Dodd-Frank provisions include (i) final capital rules, (ii) a final rule to implement the so-called Volcker rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities, and (iii) final rules and increased enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (discussed further below in connection with consumer protection).

    In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following the passage of the Dodd Frank Act, the Company experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused the Company’s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. After the 2016 federal elections, momentum to decrease the regulatory burden on community banks gathered strength. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, like the Company, and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks and their holding companies, including new rules that may make the capital requirements less complex. For a discussion of capital requirements, please refer to “-Capital Adequacy Requirements.” It also eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving the Bank of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. We believe these 
reforms are favorable to our operations, but the true impact remains difficult to predict until rulemaking is complete and the reforms are fully implemented.

    Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification as calculated based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC’s fund management authority by establishing a minimum Designated Reserve Ratio of 1.35 percent of total estimated insured deposits and redefining the assessment base to be calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The Bank’s Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base by the applicable assessment rate. The Bank's annual assessment rate was 6.22 basis points based on its September 30, 2020 assessment invoice. 
On September 30, 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.36%. The FDIC issued assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for their portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC issued the assessment credits of $352 thousand to the Bank, of which $212 thousand was received in 2019 and the remaining assessment credits were applied in 2020. As of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30% as result of extraordinary insured deposit growth from the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors waived the provision of the FDIC’s assessment regulations requiring that the reserve ratio must be at least 1.35 percent for the FDIC to remit the full nominal value of an insured depository institution’s remaining assessment credits. All remaining small bank credits were refunded on the September 30, 2020, assessment invoice, ending the application of small bank credits.
Effective June 26, 2020, the FDIC adopted a Final Rule to mitigate the effect on deposit insurance assessments when an insured institution participates in either or both the PPP and Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ("MMLF"). Under the rule, the FDIC provides adjustments to the risk based premium formula and certain of its risk ratios, and provides an offset to an insured institution’s total assessment amount due for the increase to its assessment base attributable to participation in the PPP and MMLF. 
Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) activities. The CRA generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution’s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or the formation of holding companies. In measuring a bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations, the regulators utilize a performance-based evaluation system under which CRA ratings are determined by the bank’s actual lending, service, and investment performance, rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements. In connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the federal regulatory agencies assign a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank received an “Outstanding” rating in its most recent CRA evaluation in 2019.
In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators recommending changes to the CRA’s regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks, and in September 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued for public comment proposed rules to modernize the agencies' regulations under the CRA. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the CRA regulations.
    Privacy and Data Security. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Financial Modernization Act”), imposed requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy. Financial institutions, however, are required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the Financial Modernization Act. The Financial Modernization Act generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. The statute also directed federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, to establish standards for the security of consumer information, and requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
    In June 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives “consumers” (generally natural persons who are California residents) four basic rights in relation to their personal information: (i) the right to know, through a general privacy policy and with more specifics available upon request, what personal information a business has collected about them, where it was sourced from, what it is being used for, whether it is being disclosed or sold, and to whom it is being disclosed or sold; (ii) the right to “opt out” of allowing a business to sell their personal information to third parties (or, for consumers who are under 16 years old, the right 
not to have their personal information sold absent their, or their parent’s, opt-in); (iii) the right to have a business delete their personal information, with some exceptions; and (iv) the right to receive equal service and pricing from a business, even if they exercise their privacy rights under the CCPA.
    In November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was enacted into law which enhances the CCPA with enforcement of stricter protection of consumer privacy and adds additional requirements for businesses. The CPRA will be in full effect on January 2023, with a 1-year look back period for all data collected as of January 1, 2022. The employee and business-to-business exemption has been extended from January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2023. As a regulated financial institution, we are already complying with both federal and state financial privacy laws and regulations, many of which either overlap with the requirements of the CCPA or supersede the requirements of the CCPA. However, given the expansion of CCPA rights under the CPRA and that the CPRA is not yet effective, we are not able to assess the impact of compliance with the additional requirements of the CPRA may have on operational expenses, which could be significant. 
    Consumer Financial Protection and Financial Privacy. Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as an independent entity with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB’s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the Bank, although only banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, are examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency.
    In January 2013, the CFPB issued final regulations governing consumer mortgage lending. Certain rules which became effective in January 2014 impose additional requirements on lenders, including the directive that lenders need to ensure the ability of their borrowers to repay mortgages. The CFPB also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the high-cost mortgage provision in the Truth in Lending Act. The CFPB also issued final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that relate to mortgage servicing. In November 2013 the CFPB issued a final rule on integrated and simplified mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which became effective in October 2015.
    The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s: (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests.
    In addition, as is the case with all financial institutions, the Bank is required to maintain the privacy of its customers’ non-public, personal information. Such privacy requirements direct financial institutions to: (i) provide notice to customers regarding privacy policies and practices; (ii) inform customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties; and (iii) give customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to non-affiliated third parties.
    The Company continues to be subject to numerous other federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. Those laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, and respective state-law counterparts to these laws, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other laws require disclosures including the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, and otherwise subject the holding company to substantial regulatory oversight.
    Identity Theft. Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the “FACT Act”), the Bank is required to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft “red flags” in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of certain accounts. Under the FACT Act, the Bank is required to adopt reasonable policies and procedures to (i) identify relevant red flags for covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; (ii) detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; (iii) respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and (iv) ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect 
changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft. The Bank maintains a program to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the Bank believes it is currently in compliance with these requirements.

Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity. Several federal laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act) require all financial institutions, including banks, to implement policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on clients. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition. The Patriot Act of 2001 substantially enhanced anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and required certain regulatory authorities to adopt rules that promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The Patriot Act also requires all financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Bank expanded its Bank Secrecy Act compliance staff and intensified due diligence procedures concerning the opening of new accounts to fulfill the anti-money laundering requirements of the Patriot Act, and also implemented systems and procedures to identify suspicious banking activity and report any such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, designated nationals and others. These rules are based on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC‑administered sanctions targeting designated countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment‑related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil money penalties on the Company and the Bank.
    Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to help ensure that banking organizations do not undermine their own safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. The regulatory agencies will review, as part of their regular risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” Where appropriate, the regulatory agencies will take supervisory or enforcement action to address perceived deficiencies in an institution’s incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management, control, and governance processes. We believe that we are in compliance with the regulatory guidance on incentive compensation policies.

    Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidelines on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution’s concentrations in CRE lending activities. These guidelines were issued in response to the agencies’ concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the commercial real estate market. The guidelines identify certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution’s CRE concentration risk. The guidelines are designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the guidelines establish the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (1) the institution’s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total CRE loans as defined in the regulatory guidelines represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital, and the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 month period. The Company believes that the guidelines are applicable to it, as it has a relatively high concentration in CRE loans. The Company and its Board of Directors have discussed the guidelines and believe that the Bank’s underwriting policies, 
management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are sufficient to address the guidelines.
Other Pending and Proposed Legislation. Other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the Company, the Bank and the banking industry in general are pending, and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the United States Congress, the California legislature and other governmental bodies in the future. Such proposals, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject the Company to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements. In addition, the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Company would be affected thereby.
