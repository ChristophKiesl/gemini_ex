Overview 

SIGA Technologies, Inc. is referred to throughout this report as “SIGA,” “the Company,” “we” or “us.” 

We are a company specializing in the development and commercialization of solutions for serious unmet medical needs and biothreats. Our lead product is TPOXX®, an orally administered antiviral drug that targets orthopoxvirus infections. While TPOXX® is not yet approved as safe or effective by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, it is a novel small-molecule drug that is being delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile under Project BioShield.
BARDA Contract - TPOXX®

On May 13, 2011, the Company signed a contract with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA") pursuant to which SIGA agreed to deliver two million courses of TPOXX® to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (“Strategic Stockpile”). The contract with BARDA (as modified, the "BARDA Contract") is worth approximately $472 million, including $409.8 million related to the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of TPOXX® and $62 million of potential reimbursements connected to development and supportive activities (the “Base Contract”).
Under the Base Contract, BARDA has agreed to buy from the Company 1.7 million courses of TPOXX®. Additionally, the Company expects to contribute to BARDA 300,000 courses at no additional cost to BARDA. A total of 2.0 million courses of TPOXX® is required to be delivered to the Strategic Stockpile in order for the Company to receive the $41 million hold back payment (see description of hold back payment below).
2

For courses of TPOXX® that are physically delivered to the Strategic Stockpile, the Company has replacement obligations, at no cost to BARDA, in the event that the final version of TPOXX® approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") is different from any courses of TPOXX® that have been delivered to the Strategic Stockpile or if TPOXX® does not meet any specified label claims, fails release testing, does not meet 38 month expiry period (from time of delivery to the Strategic Stockpile), or if TPOXX® is recalled or deemed to be recalled for any reason.
On June 28, 2016, the Company entered into a modification of the BARDA Contract (the "BARDA Contract Modification"). The total value of the BARDA Contract is unchanged. Pursuant to the BARDA Contract Modification: 

• | The payment for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of TPOXX® increased by $61.5 million. This was accomplished by reducing the holdback amount that is tied to the United States Food & Drug Administration (the "FDA") approval of TPOXX® from $102.5 million to $41 million. In July 2016, the Company received payment of $32.6 million in connection with the BARDA Contract Modification for courses previously delivered to the Strategic Stockpile. 


• | The requirements for the $20.5 million milestone changed. For payment, this milestone was modified to require the Company to submit documentation to BARDA indicating that data covering the first 100 subjects enrolled in the phase III pivotal safety study have been submitted to and reviewed by a Data & Safety Monitoring Board ("DSMB") and that such DSMB has recommended continuation of the safety study, as well as submission of the final pivotal rabbit efficacy study report to the FDA. Previously, this milestone required the successful submission to the FDA of a complete application for TPOXX® regulatory approval. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company met the modified milestone and received payment. 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company has received $360.4 million under the Base Contract related to the manufacture and physical delivery of courses of TPOXX®. Included in this amount are a $41 million advance payment in 2011 for the completion of certain planning and preparatory activities related to the Base Contract, a $12.3 million milestone payment in 2012 for the completion of the product labeling strategy for TPOXX®, an $8.2 million milestone payment in 2013 for the completion of the commercial validation campaign for TPOXX®, the $20.5 million milestone payment (referenced above) in 2016 for submission of documentation to BARDA indicating that data covering the first 100 subjects enrolled in the phase III pivotal safety study have been submitted to and reviewed by a DSMB and that such DSMB has recommended continuation of the safety study, as well as submission of the final pivotal rabbit efficacy study report to the FDA, and $278.4 million of payments for physical deliveries of TPOXX® to the Strategic Stockpile beginning in 2013. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company was eligible to receive an additional $49.4 million under the Base Contract for the manufacture, delivery and purchase by BARDA of courses of TPOXX®. Included in this amount are: $8.5 million of payments related to physical deliveries of TPOXX® to the Strategic Stockpile ; and a $41 million hold back payment, which represents an approximate 10% hold back on the $409.8 million of total payments related to the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of TPOXX® that are to be purchased by BARDA. The $41 million hold back payment would be triggered by FDA approval of TPOXX®, as long as the Company has cumulatively delivered 2.0 million courses of TPOXX® to the Strategic Stockpile and the Company does not have a continuing product replacement obligation to BARDA. In February 2017, the Company received an $8.5 million payment for a product delivery made in January 2017 of TPOXX® courses. 
With regard to future product deliveries after February 28, 2017, the Company expects to deliver approximately 467,000 courses of TPOXX® at no cost to BARDA in order to fulfill the delivery requirements of the BARDA Contract. Courses to be delivered are expected to be at a dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day). The “no cost to BARDA” courses are attributable to a change in TPOXX® dosage (see paragraph below). Courses delivered to the Strategic Stockpile are subject to a product replacement obligation.
Starting in 2015, product deliveries of TPOXX® have been at a provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day). This is a change from the provisional dosage that was in effect when product deliveries were made in 2013 and 2014 (600 mg per day). In 2013 and 2014, the provisional dosage of courses delivered to the Strategic Stockpile was 600 mg administered once a day. The change in the provisional dosage was based on FDA guidance received by the Company in 2014, subsequent to the delivery of 1.3 million courses of TPOXX®. Based on the current provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day), the Company expects to supplement previously delivered courses of TPOXX®, at no cost to BARDA, with additional dosages so that all of the courses previously delivered to BARDA will be at the current provisional dosage. The Company and BARDA agreed to an amendment (the “BARDA Amendment”) of the BARDA Contract to reflect the foregoing. In February 2016, the FDA confirmed (through dose concurrence) its earlier dosage guidance of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day). 
The Company is incurring significant incremental costs with the production of additional dosage at no cost to BARDA. 
3

At the current provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day), the Company expects that total manufacturing costs, as a percentage of the $409.8 million that can be received by the Company for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of TPOXX®, will be less than 25%. This percentage estimate is subject to change if, among other things, the provisional dosage changes or if $409.8 million is not received by the Company from BARDA.
In addition to the Base Contract, the BARDA Contract also separately contains $122.7 million of options that, if exercised by BARDA: would result in a $50 million payment to the Company in the event of FDA approval for extension to 84-month expiry for TPOXX® (from 38 month expiry as required in the Base Contract); would fund up to $58.3 million of development and supportive activities such as work on a smallpox prophylaxis indication for TPOXX®; and/or would fund $14.4 million of production-related activities related to warm-base manufacturing. In 2015, BARDA exercised two options related to extending the indication of the drug to the geriatric and pediatric populations. The stated value of these exercises was minimal. BARDA may not exercise additional options in the future. Options are exercisable by BARDA at its sole discretion. BARDA has indicated that it will evaluate, after the FDA’s review and evaluation of stability data, the Company's request that BARDA exercise the option for the $50 million payment to the Company in the event of FDA approval of 84-month expiry for TPOXX®. 
The BARDA Contract expires in September 2020.
The Company has been actively pursuing FDA approval of TPOXX® for strategic purposes as well as for purposes of receiving the $41 million hold back payment (discussed above). The Company is pursuing FDA approval under the “animal rule.” As such, the Company has completed multiple monkeypox efficacy studies in non-human primates and has also completed a series of rabbitpox efficacy studies in rabbits. At this point in time, the Company does not expect additional efficacy studies to be required prior to the filing of a New Drug Application (“NDA”). In August 2016, the Company announced completion of enrollment and dosing in the Phase III clinical study. Safety was the only primary endpoint required in this study; and no drug-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) were reported. SIGA is targeting the second or third quarter of 2017 for completion of testing and analysis of data for the Phase III clinical study. SIGA is also targeting the second or third quarter of 2017 for completion of testing and analysis of data for secondary clinical trials, such as those related to safety for special populations and drug-to-drug interaction. An NDA filing for TPOXX is targeted to occur by the end of 2017.
Notwithstanding the above, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve an NDA for TPOXX®. Upon FDA approval of an NDA for TPOXX®, the Company would be able to address replacement obligations, if any, relating to courses of TPOXX® that have been delivered to the Strategic Stockpile.
Lead Product - TPOXX®™ 
SIGA believes that TPOXX® is among the first new small-molecule drugs delivered to the Strategic Stockpile under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (“Project BioShield”). TPOXX® is an investigational product that is not currently approved by the FDA as a treatment of smallpox or any other indication. Nevertheless, the FDA has designated TPOXX® for “fast-track” status, creating a path for expedited FDA review and eventual potential regulatory approval. TPOXX® is a novel, patented drug that is easy to store, transport and administer. There could be several uses for an effective antiviral drug to treat orthopox infection: to reduce mortality and morbidity in those infected with the smallpox virus, to protect the non-immune who risk developing smallpox following virus exposure, as an adjunct to the smallpox vaccine in order to reduce the frequency of serious adverse events due to the live virus used for vaccination, and to treat other orthopox infections (such as monkey pox). 
TPOXX®’s regulatory path, and SIGA’s development activities related to TPOXX®, are materially guided by the results of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting that was held in December 2011 (the “Advisory Committee”). The Advisory Committee was convened to consider proposals for using a surrogate orthopoxvirus model and to determine what elements of the “animal rule” constitute “enough” evidence for approval of a drug for the treatment of orthopox infections. The Advisory Committee’s recommendation confirmed that the monkeypox, rabbitpox and ectromelia models, especially in combination, could suitably provide appropriate evidence of efficacy. Subsequent to the Advisory Committee, SIGA has had substantive meetings and communications with the FDA regarding the regulatory path of TPOXX®. Development activities for TPOXX® are based on the Advisory Committee’s recommendation, and take into account meetings and communications with the FDA. 
In late 2010, TPOXX® received Orphan Drug designation for the broader indication of treatment of orthopoxvirus infections (vaccinia, variola, monkeypox and cowpox). An Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for an intravenous (IV) formulation of TPOXX® was filed with FDA in September 2012 and SIGA received a safe to proceed letter from FDA in November 2012 along with a letter granting fast-track status. SIGA initiated phase 1 single ascending dose safety and pharmacokinetic study for the IV formulation in the first quarter of 2016.

Chapter 11 Filing
On September 16, 2014 (the “Petition Date”), the Company filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) chapter 11 Case Number 14-12623 (SHL). The Company operated its business as a “debtor-in-possession” until its emergence from chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company emerged from chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 12, 2016. The Company did not apply the provision of fresh start accounting as ownership of existing shares of the Company's common stock remained unaltered by the Third Amended Chapter 11 Plan as discussed below in the "Plan of Reorganization".
The chapter 11 case preserved the Company's ability to satisfy its commitments under the BARDA Contract (as defined in Note 3 to the financial statements) and preserved its operations, which likely would have been jeopardized by the enforcement of a judgment stemming from the litigation with PharmAthene, Inc. (“PharmAthene”) (see “PharmAthene Litigation” below). While operating as a debtor-in-possession under chapter 11, the Company pursued an appeal of the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment, without having to post a bond.
Plan of Reorganization
On April 7, 2016, the Company filed its Third Amended Chapter 11 Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan addressed, among other things, how the Company would treat and satisfy its liabilities relating to the period prior to the commencement of its chapter 11 case, including all claims held by PharmAthene. On April 8, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan and on April 12, 2016, the Plan became effective (the "Effective Date of the Plan").
The Plan provided for, among other things:

• | The immediate payment in cash in full of prepetition unsecured claims (other than PharmAthene’s claim). The Company paid approximately $800,000 to satisfy the claims.


• | On the Effective Date of the Plan, the Company paid $5 million to PharmAthene, which amount was applied against PharmAthene's claim. On July 8, 2016, pursuant to the Plan, the Company delivered to PharmAthene a notification (the “Notification”) of its intention to satisfy PharmAthene’s claim by payment in full in cash, and at that time paid PharmAthene $20 million, which was applied against its claim. As a consequence of the Notification and the payment of $20 million to PharmAthene, the Company had until October 19, 2016 (“Final Treatment Date”) to settle the PharmAthene claim under the Plan. On August 18, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order affirming a joint motion to further extend the Final Treatment Date to November 30, 2016, provided that the Company made a $100 million payment to PharmAthene by October 19, 2016 which would be applied against its claim. Between August and early October, the Company paid PharmAthene $100 million in order to satisfy the extension requirement.On November 16, 2016, the Company paid its remaining obligations to PharmAthene under the Plan. 

In total, a cumulative amount of $217 million (including interest payments at periodic intervals) was paid by the Company to fully satisfy the PharmAthene claim. The chapter 11 case was closed by the Bankruptcy Court on December 22, 2016.
PharmAthene Litigation
After several years of proceedings in litigation initiated by PharmAthene in 2006, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued an opinion and order on August 8, 2014 in which it determined, among other things, that PharmAthene was entitled to a lump sum damages award for its lost profits including interest and fees, based on United States government purchases of the Company's smallpox drug allegedly anticipated as of December 2006. On September 16, 2014, as a consequence of SIGA’s chapter 11 filing, the legal proceedings with PharmAthene were stayed, except that the parties agreed by stipulation approved by the Court on October 8, 2014 that the litigation could proceed. On January 15, 2015, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered its Final Order and Judgment (the "Final Order and Judgment") awarding PharmAthene approximately $195 million, including pre-judgment interest up to January 15, 2015 (the “Outstanding Judgment”). On December 23, 2015 the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Outstanding Judgment (the “Delaware Supreme Court Affirmation”). Pursuant to the Final Order and Judgment, SIGA also was liable to PharmAthene for $30,663.89 per day in post-judgment interest. On a series of dates up to and including a final payment on November 16, 2016, the Company paid PharmAthene an aggregate of $217 million to fully satisfy the Outstanding Judgment, including post-judgment interest, in accordance with the Plan as described in Note 1 to the financial statements.

Loan Agreement
On September 2, 2016, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (as may be amended from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”) with OCM Strategic Credit SIGTEC Holdings, LLC (“Lender”), pursuant to which the Company received $80 million on November 16, 2016 having satisfied certain pre-conditions. The amount to be loaned to the Company pursuant to the Loan Agreement ($80 million) had been placed in an escrow account on September 30, 2016 (the “Escrow Funding Date”). Prior to the Escrow Release Date (November 16, 2016), the Company did not have access to, or any ownership interest in, the escrow account. Until the Escrow Release Date occurred, the Company did not have an obligation to make any payments under the Loan Agreement, no security was granted under the Loan Agreement and no affirmative or negative covenants or events of default were effective under the Loan Agreement. Amounts were held in the escrow account until the satisfaction of certain conditions including the closing of the Rights Offering on November 16, 2016. Amounts held in the escrow account between September 30, 2016 and November 15, 2016 bore interest at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus 11.50%. Interest on amounts held in the escrow account became payable only when the Escrow Release Date occurred. As part of the satisfaction of the PharmAthene claim, funds were released from the escrow account (the date on which such transfer occurred, the “Escrow Release Date”). 
The Loan Agreement provides for a first-priority senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $80,000,000 (the “Term Loan”), of which (i) $25,000,000 was placed in a reserve account (the “Reserve Account”) only be utilized to pay interest on the Term Loan as it becomes due; (ii) an additional $5,000,000 was also placed in the Reserve Account and up to the full amount of such $5,000,000 may be withdrawn after June 30, 2018 upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, provided that any of such amount is required to fund any interest to the extent any interest in excess of the aforementioned $25,000,000 is due and owing and any of such $5,000,000 remains in the Reserve Account; and (iii) $50,000,000 (net of fees and expenses then due and owing to the Lender) was paid to PharmAthene as part of the final satisfaction of the PharmAthene claim. Interest on the Term Loan is at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 11.50%, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Loan Agreement. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information.
Warrant

On September 2, 2016, in connection with the entry into the Loan Agreement, the Company issued a warrant (the “Warrant”) to the Lender to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $4 million divided by the lower of (i) $2.29 per share and (ii) the subscription price paid in connection with the Rights Offering. The Warrant provided for weighted average anti-dilution protection and is exercisable in whole or in part for ten (10) years from the date of issuance. The subscription price paid in connection with the Rights Offering was $1.50; accordingly, the exercise price of the Warrant has been set at $1.50 per shares and 2.7 million shares can be purchased under the Warrant. The Warrant had a fair value of $6.7 million at December 31, 2016 and is classified as a liability. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information.
Rights Offering

On November 16, 2016, the Company completed a rights offering (the “Rights Offering”), pursuant to which it raised approximately $35.3 million in gross proceeds through the sale of 23,523,195 shares of its common stock. The Rights Offering was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and declared effective by the SEC on October 21, 2016. As part of the Rights Offering, each stockholder of the Company received one subscription right for each share of common stock owned as of the record date of October 12, 2016. Each subscription right entitled its holder to invest $0.65 towards the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock at a subscription price equal to the lower of $1.50 or 85% of the volume weighted average price of Company shares during market hours on the expiration date of the Rights Offering. The Rights Offering expired at 5:00 pm, New York City time, on November 8, 2016. Through basic subscriptions and oversubscriptions, the Rights Offering was fully subscribed. The subscription price was set at $1.50. The Company used the net proceeds of the Rights Offering, together with proceeds from the Loan Agreement (discussed above) and cash on hand, to fully satisfy PharmAthene's claim under the Plan.
Rights Offering - Backstop Agreement
On October 13, 2016, in connection with the Rights Offering as discussed above, the Company entered into an investment agreement or "Backstop Agreement," with an affiliate of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated ("M&F"), and other backstop parties (the "Backstop Parties"). Under the term of the Backstop Agreement, the Backstop Parties agreed to purchase, pursuant to a separate private placement, a number of shares of common stock equal to the numbers of shares that would have not been subscribed for in the Rights Offering. Under the Backstop Agreement, the subscription price was set to be equal to the subscription price applicable to all shareholders under the Rights Offering. The Rights Offering was fully subscribed, the Backstop Parties were not required to draw on such commitment. The Company issued 708,530 shares to Backstop Parties in payment of the five percent 
6

backstop fee ($1,764,240) payable to the Backstop Parties in connection with the Backstop Agreement entered into between the Company and the Backstop Parties. When shares were issued to the Backstop Parties in payment of the backstop fee, the stock price of SIGA common stock was $2.49 per share (the closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 16, 2016). The fair value of the shares issued in satisfaction of the backstop fee has been expensed on the income statement in 2016. There are no remaining payment obligations to the Backstop Parties under the Backstop Agreement.
Manufacturing
SIGA does not have a manufacturing infrastructure and does not intend to develop one for the manufacture of TPOXX®. SIGA relies on and uses third parties known as Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”) to procure commercial raw materials and supplies, and to manufacture TPOXX®. SIGA's CMOs apply methods and controls in facilities that are used for manufacturing, processing, packaging, testing, analyzing and holding pharmaceuticals which conform to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), the standard set by FDA for manufacture of pharmaceuticals intended for human use. 
For the manufacture of oral capsules of TPOXX®, the Company uses the following CMOs: Albemarle Corporation (“Albemarle”); Powdersize, LLC (“Powdersize”), and Catalent Pharma Solutions LLC (“Catalent”). 
In August, 2011, SIGA entered into an agreement with Albemarle. The agreement was amended in April, 2015. Albemarle manufactures, tests and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for use in TPOXX®. SIGA agreed that, during the term of the agreement, SIGA will purchase 75% of its internal and external API requirements for TPOXX® from Albemarle at a fixed price per kilogram. There is no minimum amount of API kilograms that must be used or acquired by SIGA. The following events are excluded from the “75% API” requirement: (i) if a contract entered into by SIGA for the sale of final drug product (“FDP”) requires that the product used as the API for such FDP be manufactured outside the U.S. and Albemarle is unwilling or unable to subcontract such manufacture to a party or parties that meet the terms of the agreement, (ii) if a contract entered into by SIGA for the sale of FDP in an intravenous formulation requires different specifications than those provided for under the agreement and the parties are not able to reach agreement on the necessary changes to the specifications or on pricing, or (iii) if Albemarle fails to perform any of its obligations under the agreement and does not cure such failure within 30 days of written notice from SIGA. SIGA is required to pay Albemarle within 45 days of their invoice date. Albemarle is required to deliver API that conforms with specifications outlined in the agreement; the Company is not required to pay for API that does not meet specifications. The Company has 120 days to reject any shipments that do not meet specifications or are damaged. In addition to receiving payments for API deliveries, Albemarle is also paid for related services, such as stability testing. The Company’s agreement with Albemarle continues for an initial term that shall continue until December 31, 2017.The Company has an option to extend the term up to an additional twelve months, if necessary, to fulfill its obligations under the BARDA Contract. Commencing ninety days prior to the termination date, the parties will negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon revised product pricing to be applicable during a renewal term of the agreement. In the event the parties are unable to agree to revised pricing during the ninety day negotiation period, then the agreement shall continue for a sixteen week period utilizing pricing in effect at the conclusion of the term; the agreement shall terminate at the end of such sixteen week period. 
Powdersize micronizes and tests API for use in TPOXX®. The Company’s agreement with Powdersize continues for an initial term that is the longer of the period ending on (i) August 15, 2014 or (ii) the date the Company has fulfilled its delivery obligations under the BARDA Contract. Thereafter, this agreement may be renewed as provided for in such agreement. 
Catalent granulates, encapsulates, tests and packages TPOXX®. Catalent sub-contracts the packaging services to Packaging Coordinators, Inc., a CMO that purchased Catalent’s packaging business. In addition, Catalent provides services related to commercial stability testing of drug product and preparation for tabulated stability and trend analysis for each time point. The Company’s agreement with Catalent continues for an initial term that is the longer of the period ending December 15, 2014 or the date the Company has fulfilled its delivery obligations under the BARDA Contract. Thereafter, this agreement may be renewed as provided for in such agreement. 
Market for Biological Defense Programs

The market for biodefense countermeasures reflects continued awareness of the threat of global terror and biowarfare activity. The U.S. government is the largest source of development and procurement funding for academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies conducting biodefense research or developing vaccines, anti-infectives and immunotherapies directed at potential agents of bioterror or biowarfare. U.S. government spending on biodefense programs includes development funding awarded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BARDA and Department of Defense (“DoD”), and procurement of countermeasures by BARDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and DoD.

Project BioShield, which was enacted in 2004, authorizes the procurement of countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks for the Strategic Stockpile, which is a national repository of medical assets and countermeasures designed to provide federal, state and local public health agencies with medical supplies needed to treat and protect those affected by terrorist attacks, natural disasters, industrial accidents and other public health emergencies. Project BioShield initially provided appropriations of $5.6 billion to be expended over ten years and expired on September 30, 2013. In 2013, Congress reauthorized Project BioShield as part of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (also known as the 2016 omnibus spending bill) includes an annual appropriation of $1.02 billion for activities related to medical countermeasures for biological and other threats to civilian populations. Of this, $510 million has been set aside for procurement (reflecting an approximate doubling from Fiscal Year 2015), and $511 million has been set aside for advanced development and administrative expenses. A Continuation Resolution is in effect across the Federal Government through April 28, 2017 and maintains fiscal year 2016 procurement and advanced development funding levels. 
In addition to the U.S. government, we believe that potential additional markets for the sale of biodefense countermeasures include: 

• | foreign governments, including both defense and public health agencies;


• | state and local governments, which may be interested in these products to protect, among others, emergency responders, such as police, fire and emergency medical personnel;


• | healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics; and


• | non-governmental organizations and multinational companies, including transportation and security companies.

The 21st Century Cures Act, H.R. 6, passed Congress and was signed by then-President Obama at the end of his term. The legislation aims to enhance the discovery and delivery of lifesaving biomedical research, among other important initiatives. In addition, H.R. 6 established a priority review voucher (PRV) program for medical countermeasures (MCM) to encourage the development of drugs needed in the event of a global pandemic or biological weapon attack.  Specifically, the program created by the new legislation established eligibility for a PRV to be granted by the FDA for newly-approved products directed at mitigating material biodefense threats, including smallpox. The vouchers constitute a critical incentive to spur private sector investment and innovation in MCM research and development with the objective of fortifying the country's defenses against the world’s deadliest biological agents. If awarded, PRVs may be sold on the open market. Based on this new legislation, SIGA may be eligible for a PRV following FDA approval of TPOXX®. There is no assurance that TPOXX® will be approved or that the Company will be granted a PRV. SIGA will not know until final FDA review and approval of its NDA for TPOXX® whether it has been awarded a PRV under this new legislation.  If SIGA qualifies for a PRV, the potential sale of a PRV could generate significant cash proceeds, although no assurance can be given as to the nature and magnitude of sale proceeds, if any, on the sale of a PRV.
Other Product Candidate

Dengue fever, an acute febrile disease characterized by a sudden onset of fever and an abnormally high internal body temperature, is caused by one of four serotypes of dengue virus of the genus Flavivirus. Dengue fever can be classified as classical dengue fever, severe dengue (which includes the life threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever syndrome), or dengue shock syndrome. Dengue virus may be transmitted via the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world.
Each year, regional epidemics of dengue fever cause significant morbidity and mortality. Regional epidemics also cause social disruption and substantial economic burden in affected areas, in part due to increased hospitalization rates and necessary mosquito control.  The World Health Organization estimates that forty percent of the world's population is at risk with an estimated 50-100 million people infected with the virus each year. There is currently no approved antiviral or vaccine for the treatment or prevention of dengue-mediated disease. We have identified a lead pre-clinical drug candidate with activity against all four serotypes of virus and which has shown efficacy in a murine model of disease.
We are seeking partners for our Dengue Antiviral drug candidate to support further development activity.
In May 2011, we received a 5-year grant of $6.3 million from NIH to continue funding for the development of antiviral drugs for dengue. The grant has been extended to April 2017. As of December 31, 2016, there is approximately $1.0 million available under this grant.

Research Agreements 

We obtain funding in the form of grants or contracts from various agencies of the U.S. government to support our research and development activities. Currently, in addition to the BARDA Contract, we have one contract and one grant with varying expiration dates through June 2020 that provide for potential future aggregate research and development funding for specific projects of approximately $18.0 million. This amount includes, among other things, options that may or may not be exercised at the U.S. government’s discretion. We may not utilize all available funds under the grant covering the pre-clinical drug candidate. Moreover, the contracts and grants contain customary terms and conditions and include the U.S. government’s right to terminate or restructure a grant for convenience at any time.
General 

We receive cash payments from NIH and BARDA on a monthly basis, as services are performed or goods are purchased. Amounts under contract and grant agreements, including the BARDA Contract, are not guaranteed and can be canceled at any time for reasons such as non-performance or convenience of the U.S. government and, if canceled, we will not receive funds for additional work under the agreements.
Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include most of the major pharmaceutical companies, each of which has financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. Biotechnology and other pharmaceutical competitors in the biodefense space include, but are not limited to, Bavarian Nordic AS, Chimerix Inc., and Emergent BioSolutions. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures.

TPOXX® faces significant competition for U.S. government funding for both development and procurement of medical countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats, diagnostic testing systems, and other emergency preparedness countermeasures.

Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. In addition, we may not be able to compete effectively if our product candidates do not satisfy governmental procurement requirements, particularly requirements of the U.S. government with respect to biodefense products. 
Human Resources and Research Facilities 

As of February 28, 2017, we had 36 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Our research and development facilities are located in Corvallis, Oregon, where we lease approximately 9,237 square feet under a lease agreement signed in January 2007, as amended in May 2011, and in April 2015, and which expires in December 2017. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights

SIGA’s commercial success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its proprietary technologies, drug targets, and potential products and to preserve its trade secrets. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing potential products through the development and regulatory clearance processes to reach the marketplace, the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date. Accordingly, SIGA cannot predict the type and extent of claims that will be allowed in pending patent applications.
SIGA also relies upon trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that other companies will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to SIGA’s trade secrets or that SIGA can meaningfully protect its trade secrets. 
SIGA exclusively owns its key patent portfolio, which relates to its leading drug candidate TPOXX® (ST-246). As of January 30, 2017, the TPOXX® patent portfolio has seven patent families consisting of eleven U.S. utility patents, twenty-one issued foreign patents, one U.S. provisional application, five U.S. utility patent applications, and sixty-six foreign patent applications

* ARIPO has 19 member African States as follows: Botswana, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The principal and material patent applications covering TPOXX® include patent filings in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and other commercially significant markets. We hold 72 patent applications currently pending with respect to various compositions of TPOXX®, methods of manufacturing, methods of treatment, and dosage forms. Expiration dates for pending patents, if granted, will fall between 2024 and 2034.
TPOXX® is currently SIGA’s sole clinical-stage drug candidate. In addition to the TPOXX® patent portfolio, SIGA also has patents covering pre-clinical drug candidates. Substantially all of the pre-clinical patent portfolio is for Dengue Antiviral drug candidate. SIGA is currently seeking partners for its Dengue Antiviral drug candidate to support further development activity.
FDA regulations require that patented drugs be sold under brand names that comply with various regulations. SIGA must develop and make efforts to protect these brand names for each of its products in order to avoid product piracy and to secure exclusive rights to these brand names. SIGA may expend substantial funds in developing and securing rights to adequate brand names for our products. SIGA currently has proprietary trademark rights in SIGA®, TPOXX® and other brands used by us in the United States and certain foreign countries, but we may have to develop additional trademark rights in order to comply with regulatory requirements. SIGA considers securing adequate trademark rights to be important to its business.
Government Regulation 

Regulatory Approval Process
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of any biopharmaceutical product that we may develop. The nature and the extent to which such regulations may apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any such product. Virtually all of our potential biopharmaceutical products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to non-governmental commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures by FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of such products. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and foreign statutes and regulations is complex and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. 

In order to test clinically, and to produce and market products for diagnostic or therapeutic use, a company must comply with mandatory procedures and safety standards established by FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. Before 
11

beginning human clinical testing of a potential new drug in the United States, a company must file an IND application and receive clearance from FDA. An IND application is a summary of the pre-clinical studies that were conducted to characterize the drug, including toxicity and safety studies, information on the drug’s composition and the manufacturing and quality control procedures used to produce the drug, as well as a discussion of the human clinical studies that are being proposed. 
The pre-marketing clinical program required for approval by FDA for a new drug typically involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, trials are conducted with a small number of healthy subjects to determine the early safety profile, the pattern of drug distribution, metabolism and elimination. In Phase II, trials are conducted with small groups of patients afflicted with a target disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In Phase III, large scale, multi-center comparative trials, which may include both controlled and uncontrolled studies, are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for statistical proof of efficacy and safety required by FDA and other authorities. 

FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, in its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data that has been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patients involved in the testing. Estimates of the total time typically required for carrying out such clinical testing vary between two and ten years. Upon completion of such clinical testing, a company typically submits an NDA to FDA that summarizes the results and observations of the drug during the clinical testing. Based on its review of the NDA, FDA will decide whether to approve the drug. This review process can be quite lengthy, and approval for the production and marketing of a new pharmaceutical product can require a number of years and substantial funding. There can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

FDA amended its regulations, effective June 30, 2002, to include the “animal rule” in circumstances that would permit the typical clinical testing regime to approve certain new drug and biological products used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents not otherwise naturally present for use in humans based on evidence of safety in healthy subjects and evidence of effectiveness derived only from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. FDA has indicated that approval for therapeutic use of TPOXX® will be determined under the “animal rule.”

Once the product is approved for sale, FDA regulations govern the production process and marketing activities, and a post-marketing testing and surveillance program may be required to monitor a product’s usage and effects. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. Many other countries in which products developed by us may be marketed impose similar regulatory processes. 

FDA regulations also make available an alternative regulatory mechanism that may lead to use of the product under limited circumstances. The Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) authority allows the FDA Commissioner to strengthen the public health protections against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear agents that may be used to attack the American people or the U.S. armed forces. Under this authority, the FDA Commissioner may allow medical countermeasures to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by such agents when appropriate findings are made concerning the nature of the emergency, the availability of adequate and approved alternatives, and the quality of available data concerning the drug candidate under consideration for emergency use. We have provided data to FDA to support an EUA for TPOXX® in the event of a smallpox attack. In November 2012, CDC filed an IND application for use of TPOXX® in emergency situations until an EUA is in place. In December 2012, CDC received a “safe to proceed” letter from FDA for this IND. In August 2013, CDC filed a pre-EUA request for which FDA currently holds an open file.

Legislation and Regulation Related to Bioterrorism Counteragents and Pandemic Preparedness
Because some of our drug candidates are intended for the treatment of diseases that may result from acts of bioterrorism or biowarfare or for pandemic preparedness, they may be subject to the specific legislation and regulation described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Project BioShield
Project BioShield and related 2006 federal legislation provide procedures for biodefense-related procurement and awarding of research grants, making it easier for HHS to commit funds to countermeasure projects. Project BioShield provides alternative procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the general rubric for acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, for procuring property or services used in performing, administering or supporting biomedical countermeasure research and development. In addition, if the Secretary of HHS deems that there is a pressing need, Project BioShield authorizes 
12

the Secretary of HHS to use an expedited award process, rather than the normal peer review process, for grants, contracts and cooperative agreements related to biomedical countermeasure research and development activity.
Under Project BioShield, the Secretary of HHS, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and upon the approval of the President, can contract to purchase unapproved countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile in specified circumstances. Congress is notified of a recommendation for a Strategic National Stockpile purchase after Presidential approval. Project BioShield specifies that a company supplying the countermeasure to the Strategic National Stockpile is paid on delivery of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. To be eligible for purchase under these provisions, the Secretary of HHS must determine that there are sufficient and satisfactory clinical results or research data, including data, if available, from pre-clinical and clinical trials, to support a reasonable conclusion that the countermeasure will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years. Project BioShield also allows the Secretary of HHS to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by FDA. To exercise this authority, the Secretary of HHS must conclude that: 

• | the agent for which the countermeasure is designed can cause serious or life-threatening disease;


• | the product may reasonably be believed to be effective in detecting, diagnosing, treating or preventing the disease;


• | the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks; and


• | there is no adequate alternative to a product that is approved and available.

Although this provision permits the Secretary of HHS to circumvent FDA approval (entirely, or in part) for procurement and use , its use in this manner would likely be limited to rare circumstances. Prior to the award of the BARDA Contract in May 2011, the Secretary of HHS concluded that TPOXX® would qualify within eight years for approval by the FDA for therapeutic use against smallpox.
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act
The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, provides immunity for manufacturers from claims under state or federal law for “loss” arising out of the administration or use of a “covered countermeasure.” However, injured persons may still bring a suit for “willful misconduct” against the manufacturer under some circumstances. “Covered countermeasures” include security countermeasures and “qualified pandemic or epidemic products”, including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease, as well as treatments intended to address conditions caused by such products. For these immunities to apply, the Secretary of HHS must issue a declaration in cases of public health emergency or “credible risk” of a future public health emergency. Since 2007, the Secretary of HHS has issued 8 declarations under the PREP Act to protect from liability countermeasures that are necessary to prepare the nation for potential pandemics or epidemics, including a declaration on October 10, 2008 that provides immunity from tort liability as it relates to smallpox. The PREP Act was Amended in 2015 to extend protection for smallpox and other countermeasures from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2022. 
Foreign Regulation
As noted above, in addition to regulations in the United States, we might be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our drug candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we may have to obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The actual time required to obtain clearance to market a product in a particular foreign jurisdiction varies substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical drug candidate, the specific requirements of that jurisdiction, and in some countries whether FDA has previously approved the drug for marketing. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Certain foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted biodefense-specific regulation akin to that available in the United States such as a procedure similar to the “animal rule” promulgated by FDA. 
Regulations Regarding Government Contracting 
The status of an organization as a government contractor in the United States and elsewhere means that the organization is also subject to various statutes and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which governs the procurement of goods and services by agencies of the United States. These governing statutes and regulations can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil damages liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various statutes and regulations, government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience in the United States and elsewhere, detailed auditing 
13

requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes.
