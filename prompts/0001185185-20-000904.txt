Item 1.    Description of Business
 
Description of business, principal products, services and their markets
 
Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “us”, the “Company”, or the “Parent Company”) was incorporated in Texas on October 1, 1984 as Gibbs Construction, Inc. (“Gibbs”). The Company changed its name from Gibbs Construction, Inc. to Acacia Automotive, Inc. effective February 20, 2007. On October 18, 2012, the Company changed its name from Acacia Automotive, Inc. to Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. in an effort to exemplify the Company’s desire to expand into alternative industries as well as more diversified service and product offerings.  
 
On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired the assets of the MariJ Group of companies that included MariJ Agricultural, JR Cannabis Industries, LLC and Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, LLC.  The transaction had an effective date of January 4, 2016. On January 19, 2016 the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the acquisition. The Company subsequently filed expanded and updated information relating to that acquisition on its Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A on April 25, 2016.  That document is available for viewing on the Company’s website at http://www.acacia.bz/sec/sec.htm and on the SEC website at:
 
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001463/000118518516004336/0001185185-16-004336-index.htm 
 
In 2016, following the acquisition, the Company formed two new subsidiaries to conduct its new medical hemp business activities, being MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MariJ Pharma”) and Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc. (“Canna-Cures”). In 2017, the Company formed a new subsidiary Eufloria Medical of Tennessee, Inc. (“EMT”) to conduct its retail business in the state of Tennessee. In July 2018, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of Medahub Operations Group, Inc. and Medahub, Inc., technology companies (“Medahub”), complete with a current compounding pharmacy license in Florida.
 
On March 26, 2020, the Company announced in a current report on Form 8-k that its operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic spreading throughout the United States and the world and thus the Company’s business operations have been disrupted and it was unable to timely review and prepare the Company’s financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year. As such, the Company would be making use of the 45-day grace period provided by the SEC’s Order and available filing extension to delay filing of its Annual Report. 
 
On March 31, 2020, Richard K. Pertile resigned his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for the Company. On the same date, the Company filed a current report on Form 8-k to announce that it issued in escrow 1,475,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) to ORCIM Financial Holdings, LLC (“OFH”). Each share of the Preferred Stock has fifty (50) votes per share and may be converted into fifty (50) $0.001 par value common shares. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had 43,290,331 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding. There were no other shares of any capital stock outstanding except for the common stock and Preferred Stock. As the result of the issuance of the Preferred Stock and, upon satisfaction of the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, OFH would have voting control over the Company with 73,750,000 votes on all matters submitted to stockholders for a vote. On May 20, 2020, the conditions of the Acquisition Agreement were satisfied with the resignation of the former board of directors of the Company and the change of control became effective.
 
OFH is a limited liability company domiciled in Maryland. OFH is controlled by Mr. Jeffery D. Bearden, who owns 100% of the membership interests of OFH. The Preferred Stock was acquired by OFH in exchange for its agreement to assume the debt of the Company in the approximate amount of $450,000. The funds to satisfy the outstanding debt of the Company were acquired by OFH through a loan from a hedge fund entity known as Geneva Capital.
 
On March 31, 2020, Mr. Larnell C. Simpson, Jr., age 47, was appointed as a director for Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”). Mr. Simpson also was appointed to the position of Vice President.
 
On May 20, 2020, directors Danny Gibbs, Neil B. Gholson and Dr. Richard Paula each resigned their respective positions as a director for Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc.
 
MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

MariJ Pharma had a proprietary mobile CO2, supercritical hemp oil extraction unit which was USDA certified Organic on September 28th, 2016, by OneCert, under the US National Organic Program; 7 CFR PART 205. MariJ Pharma extracted and processed very high quality, high-cannabinoid profile content medical grade hemp oils from medicinal hemp plants.  MariJ specialized in organic strains of the plant where available, setting itself apart from the general producers of non-organic products.

Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc.
 
Canna-Cures engaged in research and development activities as well as retail and wholesale distribution of medicinal hemp products and dietary supplements in Colorado until it closed operations in July 2017.  As a part of its R&D efforts, Canna-Cures sought to align itself with institutions of higher learning in working to develop new products and to identify and develop additional uses for its medicinal hemp products.
 
Canna-Cures launched its first research and development center in Colorado. In conjunction with that opening, Canna-Cures officially launched the Dahlia’s Botanicals Endocannabinoid Nutraceuticals product line.  A portion of the proceeds from our Dahlia’s Botanicals line were awarded to the Canna Moms 501(c)(3) organization in support of its continuing public education and awareness campaign.
 
Eufloria Medical of Tennessee, Inc.
 
In July 2018, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eufloria Medical of Tennessee, Inc. (“EMT”), an entity focused on the growing and distribution of new and proprietary medicinal hemp products for patients. EMT intended to utilize MariJ Pharma's USDA certified organic mobile processing and handling solutions for its customers, and technology solutions for the expanding physician market, leased a 14-acre farm with 32,000 square feet of indoor growing area in southern Tennessee.  EMT also acquired an option to purchase the farm upon favorable terms.  During 2018, EMT completed excavation and other cleanup activities and developed the farm into its first grow facility, allowing for improved efficiencies through growing, processing and manufacturing the Company’s own product line and building sales through dedicated distributors.  The Company grew its own plant material, processed that plant material through another wholly owned subsidiary, MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MariJ”) and manufactured consumer products with the “EUFLORIA” branding for the dedicated distribution channels.
 
EMT also commenced its retail and wholesale distribution of medicinal hemp products and dietary supplements in Tennessee. In addition to its current extraction operations, the Company was invited to be part of the hemp pilot program in Tennessee. This program provided the Company the license to grow, manufacture, and dispense USDA organic hemp oil in Tennessee and represented the first step in moving its operations to the east coast of the United States. The Company planned on participating in this pilot program through this new, wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Medahub, Inc. 
 
In July 2018, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of Medahub Operations Group, Inc. and Medahub, Inc., technology companies (“Medahub”), complete with a current compounding pharmacy license in Florida. The Medahub acquisition allowed the Company to be fully HIPAA compliant and cloud based on an HL7 platform. The Company could offer licensing agreements for other hemp companies wanting to be HIPAA compliant from left to right or seed to sale and Doctor to Patient. The Company continued to develop the capabilities of this technology ahead of marketing this platform to users.
 
Distribution methods of the products and services
 
MariJ Pharma extracted and processed a very high quality, high-cannabinoid profile content medical grade hemp oils from medicinal hemp plants in its propriety mobile CO2, supercritical hemp oil extraction unit which was USDA certified Organic on September 28th, 2016, by OneCert, under the US National Organic Program; 7 CFR PART205. The finished product was then delivered to its customers.
 
EMT planned to sell medicinal hemp products and dietary supplements primarily through its retail dispensaries in Tennessee and through a dedicated distribution model.
 
Status of any publicly announced new products or services
 
During 2018, the Company acquired Medahub to develop its proprietary GeoTracking Technology that was fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability standard (“HIPAA”) utilizing its “plant to patient” solution. This GeoTracking Technology was designed to provide a full-channel patient care tracking system that was fully compliant under today’s strict HIPAA regulations that required privacy and security of the patient’s information. Beginning with RFID labeling and tracking of every single seed employed in the grow program and continuing through the sale of medicinal products in a sophisticated retail Point of Sale delivery system.

The Company also planned to enter into research and development projects with institutions of higher learning in efforts to:  (i) develop new and better strains of medical hemp related products for dispensing as medications, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and potential dietary supplements; and (ii) provide private label packaging services; and (iii) sell additional medical hemp oils, oil-infused products, and other merchandise through its web-based portal or retail dispensaries planned for that purpose; and (iv) sell cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and dietary supplements containing its high-quality hemp oil extracts.
 
The Company did not have sufficient working capital to pursue its business plan in its entirety as described herein. Its ability to implement its business plan would depend on its ability to obtain sufficient working capital and to fund its operations. No assurance can be given that it would be able to obtain additional capital, or, if available, that such capital would be available at terms acceptable to the Company, or that it would be able to generate profit from operations, or if profits were generated, that they would be sufficient to carry out its business plans, or that the plans would not be modified.
 
In late March 2020, the Company’s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic spreading throughout the United States and the world.
 
Competitive business conditions and the Company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
Any industry served by the Company is likely to be highly competitive across the entire United States and the rest of the world. In particular, the hemp industry, being the impetus of all the Company’s attention at this juncture, is very highly competitive and has drawn thousands of competing entities.  While the Company believed its technology, programs, and plans place it in a posture to compete at the highest levels, the sheer numbers of competitors must be recognized. The Company devoted the majority of its efforts on production and sales of its products and services within the continental United States but may institute operations in diverse countries.  Even so, the Company must be considered as currently competing with other companies in diverse countries that can potentially produce and sell competitive products at lower prices.  While the Company believed that there are other hurdles for those foreign entities to overcome, including the high cost of international shipping to U.S. buyers, we believed that they nonetheless could compete with us in our markets.  We would potentially compete with a variety of companies, both domestic and international, and as such would be subject to various levels of competition.
 
There is no assurance the Company will be able to adhere to its plans or to engage in any acquisitions or mergers.  The Company will consider potential opportunities to buy, sell or distribute its products in other countries.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
One of the ingredients used in the extraction process is carbon dioxide. MariJ Pharma depended on a supplier to supply high quality carbon dioxide. This supplier produced the highest quality carbon dioxide for the medicinal hemp industry. If MariJ Pharma was not able to obtain carbon dioxide from this supplier, it would need to look to other suppliers to supply this critical ingredient. However, the quality of the ingredient would suffer and the Company may not be able to obtain it at reasonable cost.
 
Dependence on one or a few major customers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s revenues were concentrated on two customers, Beyond Organic Nutritional and LMK Hemp, who accounted for approximately 70% and 22%, of the total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s revenues were concentrated on two customers, WNC Hemp and CFH, Inc., who accounted for approximately 59% and 21%, of the total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration
 
The Company had patents pending, trademarks pending, and no franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. The Company intended to acquire, through its MariJ Pharma subsidiary, portions or complete ownership of licenses and grow operations in one or more states and was seeking to cultivate, organically extract and process its medicinal hemp crops year around in indoor facilities.  The acquisition of these licenses was anticipated to provide the Company with the opportunity to compound medicinal products using mixtures of high cannabinoid profile oils that have very little hallucinogenic properties but have significantly improved medicinal properties.

Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business
 
Congress voted in December 2018 to legalize the cultivation of hemp in the United States, after months of debate and negotiation between lawmakers. Hemp legalization was tucked into the 2018 farm bill, a massive piece of legislation that also addresses issues such as nutrition, conservation, trade, energy and forestry. The bill received strong bipartisan support, and the President signed it into law.
 
Now that hemp is legal, there are all kinds of implications for farmers, researchers and consumers. For decades, the federal government has treated hemp just like any other cannabis plant. Since 1970, it had been classified as a schedule 1 drug on the Drug Enforcement Administration's list of controlled substances, alongside heroin, LSD and marijuana. The DEA defines schedule 1 drugs as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. The new bill takes hemp off that list. The schedule 1 designation made universities reluctant to get involved in hemp research. With hemp being legalized now, those restrictions and hesitations about legal jeopardy have been removed. 
 
The Company, through its new subsidiaries, operated in the medical hemp sector.  In order to help our shareholders better understand the products we intended to employ in our business plans, we provided certain explanations and definitions below.
 
The Company extracted and processed a derivative of the hemp plant known as CBD oil. CBD is one of dozens of compounds found in hemp plants that belong to a class called cannabinoids. Of these compounds, CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC and THC are usually present in the highest concentrations and have the most common practical applications in the medical field.  The Company’s subsidiaries gave most attention to high-CBD/low-THC products.  Marijuana, unlike most modern-day medicine, contains a wide range of chemical compounds. Scientists have identified to date, over 114 unique molecules in hemp known as cannabinoids, which include THC and CBD. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant, but these are the compounds that are most addressed as having a use by the medical community.
 
Terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, among other things, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. In fact, while THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in marijuana work together to produce a synergy of effects. This is known as the “entourage effect.”
 
CBD and THC levels tend to vary between different strains and varieties of hemp.  By using selective breeding techniques, certain growers have managed to create varieties with high levels of CBD, CBG and THCA, being the varieties employed for oil production by the Company’s MariJ Pharmaceuticals subsidiary.  That subsidiary also specialized in extracting oil from certified organic plants, rather than the standard non-organic varieties.
 
Unlike THC; CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN do not cause a high or hallucinogenic effect. The reason why CBD is non-psychoactive is due to its lack of affinity for CB1 receptors, such as are found in high concentrations in the brain, and which become the channels through which THC is able to port its psychoactive effects.
 
Like most other companies in this industry, we are subject to various business regulations, permits and licenses. The Company, through its new subsidiaries, entered a new business realm that may entail considerably more regulation than its previous endeavors. The Company believed that it has complied with appropriate state requirements for operations and believed it has obtained all permits necessary to function under the current state regulations where we have business operations.
 
Despite the passage of the Farm Bill, inherent risks continue to exist in this industry as a result of the determination by many nationally-chartered banks. As such, some businesses maintain large sums of cash on hand, and meeting payrolls and accounts payable obligations with cash rather than checks.  As a result, those businesses are placed at high risk of internal and external theft and crimes relating to the lack of controls and security afforded by transactional banking.  The Company utilized various financial institutions for its deposit needs, but this still created risks when the proceeds at diverse production locations, often themselves in cash due to the same issues, cannot be deposited in nearby accessible depositories.  The Company had an armored vehicle for use in the transport of cash and hemp products but believes those risks would not be minimized until national depository institutions allow hemp-related businesses to utilize their facilities.
 
Estimate of the amount of money spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development
 
The Company spent a de-minimus amount on research and development during its last two fiscal years.

Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
 
The hemp industry, just like other industries, impacts our environment. Environmental laws relating to water rights, energy consumption, pollution, and overall carbon footprint all can and do impact the hemp industry.
 
While some areas of environmental law focus on the protection of the environment, others are designed to control human use of natural resources by setting up a system of environmental approvals. Environmental laws cover topics such as chemicals and pesticides, climate change and energy, coastal, marine and fisheries management, farming and private land management, forestry, clearing vegetation, trees, marine, pollution, water, just to name a few. Given all the facets of both indoor, outdoor, and greenhouse cultivation, in addition to chemical-intensive extractions and infusions of hemp oil products, it is easy to see why environmental laws are coming into play in the cannabis industry.
 
One of the most common environmental law issues for the hemp industry is waste management. Most states that legalize some form of hemp consumption strictly dictate the disposition and storage of the hemp by-products, as well as the types of pesticides, soil amendments, and fertilizers that can be safely applied to cannabis crops.
 
However, fewer states have enacted laws dealing with the industry’s impact on water and air quality, but the industry is certainly under more scrutiny. In certain states, producers and processors must pay a fee to their local or state government and submit an application for a permit, provide information on odor control equipment for producing, growing, or processing and solvent usage information for each type.
 
Energy consumption by hemp growers is also becoming an important issue. The significant use of electricity in indoor hemp production has caused concerns for the carbon-footprint of its production. States may pass legislatures to regulate energy consumption by passing the cost of such effects and consumption onto the hemp industry by instituting licensing and permitting fees.
 
Outdoor growers are not completely free of environmental concerns. They are also facing pressure under environmental laws because outdoor growing has led to deforestation, loss of wildlife, and erosion, and it often requires large amounts of water and pesticides.
 
Additional risk factor
 
War, terrorism, other acts of violence or natural or man-made disasters, including a global pandemic, may affect the markets in which the Company operates, the Company’s customers, the Company’s delivery of products and customer service, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.
 
The Company’s business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which it operates, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, food, fire, earthquake, storm or pandemic events and spread of disease (including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus commonly referred to as “COVID-19”). Such events may cause customers to suspend their decisions on using the Company’s products and services, make it impossible to attend or sponsor trade shows or other conferences in which our products and services are presented to customers and potential customers, cause restrictions, postponements and cancellations of events that attract large crowds and public gatherings such as trade shows at which we have historically presented our products, and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles that could interfere with purchases of goods or services, commitments to develop new products. These events also pose significant risks to the Company’s personnel and to physical facilities, transportation and operations, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial results.
 
Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of seven employees, five of which are full time.
