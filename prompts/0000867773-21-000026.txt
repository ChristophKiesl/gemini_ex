ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
SunPower has been a leader in the solar industry for over 30 years, originally incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004 in connection with our initial public offering. In November 2011, our stockholders approved the reclassification of all outstanding former class A common stock and class B common stock into a single class of common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "SPWR." In fiscal 2011, we became a majority owned subsidiary of Total Solar INTL SAS, formerly known as Total Solar International SAS, Total Gas & Power USA, SAS and Total Energies Nouvelles Activités USA ("Total"), a subsidiary of TOTAL SE ("TOTAL SE").
Company Overview
SunPower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, "SunPower," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a leading solar energy company that delivers complete solar solutions to customers primarily in United States and Canada through an array of hardware, software, and financing options, and "Smart Energy" solutions. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings, and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. We are a leader in the U.S. downstream Distributed Generation (“DG”) market, providing an affordable and sustainable source of electricity compared to traditional utility energy to residential homeowners and commercial customers through multiple financing options. Our sales channels include a strong network of dealers and resellers that operate in both, residential and commercial markets, as well a group of talented and driven in-house sales team within each segment engaged in direct sales to end customers. 
Recent Developments
Maxeon Solar Spin-Off Transaction 
On August 26, 2020, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd., a Singapore public company limited by shares (“Maxeon Solar”), consisting of certain non-U.S. operations and assets of our former SunPower Technologies business unit. The Spin-Off was completed by way of a pro rata distribution of all of the then-issued and outstanding ordinary shares, no par value, of Maxeon Solar to holders of record of our common stock (the “Distribution”) as of the close of business on August 17, 2020.
In connection with the Spin-Off, and as contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into by us and Maxeon Solar, we and Maxeon Solar entered into certain ancillary agreements that govern the relationships between the Company and Maxeon Solar following the Distribution, including: a tax matters agreement, employee matters agreement, transition services agreement, back-to-back agreement, brand framework agreement, cross license agreement, collaboration agreement, and supply agreement (collectively, the “Ancillary Agreements”), each as previously described in our announcement of the contemplated transaction.
Sale of Operations and Maintenance Business
On May 14, 2020, we sold the substantial majority of our O&M ("Operations & Maintenance") services contracts for utility, commercial, and industrial scale photovoltaic power projects and related assets and liabilities to NovaSource Power Services ("NovaSource”) for total consideration of $36.3 million.
Table of Contents

Upon closing, we received net cash consideration of $16.0 million, excluding certain hold-backs totaling in aggregate $15.0 million for certain retained obligations and contracts not novated as of closing. We assessed the recoverability of these hold-backs and included our best estimate of the amount recoverable in the future in our calculation of net gain on sale. Additionally, we also agreed to retain and subcontract certain O&M contracts for selected large utility scale power plant projects in North America at a fixed price to NovaSource. The contracts were deemed loss-making on the closing date and accordingly, we recorded a liability for the expected loss to be recognized for these contracts that will be amortized over the expected period of loss of three years.
Segments Overview
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and concurrent with the Spin-Off, we reorganized our business into new segments to align our focus on the U.S. downstream DG market and new business model driven by financial offerings, solar energy systems storage, solutions, and software services. Previously, we operated under two end-customer segments, comprised of our (i) SunPower Energy Services and (ii) SunPower Technologies. The SunPower Energy Services segment referred to our downstream business consisting of sales of solar energy solutions to residential and commercial end-customers, and the SunPower Technologies segment referred to global manufacturing and our large-scale solar products and systems and international component sales.
Under the new segmentation, Residential, Light Commercial ("RLC") refers to sales of solar energy solutions previously included in the legacy SunPower Energy Services segment, including sales to our third-party dealer network and resellers, storage solutions, cash and loan sales, and long-term leases directly to end customers. The Commercial and Industrial Solutions segment ("C&I Solutions") refers to direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement, and construction ("EPC") services, and sales of energy under power purchase agreements ("PPAs"). Certain legacy businesses consisting of worldwide power plant project development, project sales, and U.S. manufacturing, which we are winding down, are not significant to overall operations, and are deemed non-core to our other businesses and classified as "Others." Certain key cross-functional support functions and responsibilities including corporate strategy, treasury, tax and accounting support and services, among others, continue to be centrally managed within the Corporate function. 
Each segment is managed by a business general manager that reports to our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who reviews our business, manages resource allocations, and measures performance of our activities across the RLC, C&I Solutions, and Other segments. The CODM further views the business performance of each segment under two key sources of revenue - Dev Co and Power Co. Dev Co refers to our solar origination and installation revenue stream within each segment such as sale of solar power systems with our dealers and resellers network as well as installation and EPC revenues, while Power Co refers to our post-system sale recurring services revenues, mainly from asset management services and O&M services through our SunStrong partnership dealer services for RLC and our commercial dealer network for C&I. The risk profile of each of the revenue streams is different and, therefore, the segregation of Dev Co and Power Co provides the CODM with appropriate information to review business performance and allocate resources to each segment.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business 
The COVID-19 pandemic has driven our organizations across the globe to operate virtually to a large extent, and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before. Following the first shelter-in-place orders, we expanded our internal virtual salesforce and helped enable our dealers to complete sales consultations in a virtual setting. We have seen leads through our online and virtual sales channels at attractive customer acquisition costs. We believe that a virtual sales model will position us and our dealers to reduce customer acquisition costs in the future. 
The health and safety of our employees, contractors, and customers are a top priority for us. In an effort to protect our employees and contractors, we took and continue to take proactive and aggressive actions, starting with the earliest signs of the outbreak, to adopt social distancing policies at our locations around the world, including working from home and suspending employee travel. We have transitioned to work from home with flexible work policies, and most of our non-installation workforce is working from home and is expected to continue to do so until at least July 2021.

As the installation of solar systems is considered an essential business in many jurisdictions, employees and contractors who are working onsite are required to adhere to strict safety measures, including the use of masks and sanitizer, wellness screenings prior to accessing work sites, staggered break times to prevent congregation, prohibitions on physical contact with co-workers or customers, restrictions on access through only a single point of entry and exit, eliminating carpooling, and utilizing video conferencing, where possible. We have also incorporated other rules such as restricting visitors to any of our facilities that remain open and proactively providing employees with hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. Also, we developed a COVID-19 Response Team that meets regularly to develop tailored action plans and protocols to protect our employees and publishes these actions, guidelines, and rules on our intranet available to all employees.
At the onset of the pandemic, across the organization, we took specific measures to sustain our business and operations as well as protect our employees. These measures included temporary reductions in the salaries of certain of our executive officers and the fees payable to our independent directors, as well as temporary reductions in salaries and reduced work week schedules for certain of our employees to address reduced demand and workloads, with exceptions for certain groups, including those supporting customer and asset services. In June 2020, most of our employees resumed a full work week and returned to full salary during the last week of July. In September 2020, our executive officers and independent directors returned to full salary.
As of February 2021, COVID-19 cases continue to rise in certain areas of the United States and worldwide, and as a result, many jurisdictions are restricting or planning to restrict businesses and economic activities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such future developments, including any new government restrictions, may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our financial results. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, and as required by federal, state, or local authorities. 
Outlook 
We believe the execution of our strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long term. We believe the most significant elements of uncertainty are the intensity and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on project installation and commercial and consumer spending as well as the ability of our sales channels, supply chain, and distribution centers to operate with minimal disruption in the near term, especially if local governments impose new measures and restrictions in jurisdictions in which we operate. The disruptions noted above could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and outlook. 
Solutions 
We are focused on delivering complete solar power generation solutions to our customers. As part of our solutions-based approach, we focus on SunPower Helix products for our commercial business customers and our SunPower Equinox product for our residential business customers. The Equinox and Helix systems are pre-engineered modular solutions for residential and commercial applications, respectively, that combine our high-efficiency solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that enable our customers to quickly and easily complete system installations and manage their energy production. Our Equinox systems utilize our latest A-Series cell and alternating-current photovoltaic technology for residential applications, where we are also working to expand our initiatives on storage and Smart Energy solutions. Our Helix products are available for carport, ground, and roof installations and provide seamless solar solutions at low cost. Additionally, we continue to focus on installing our lower cost, high efficiency Performance Line and our A-Series product line, which we believe will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our global footprint with minimal capital cost. 
We continue to see significant and increasing opportunities in technologies and capabilities adjacent to our core product offerings that can significantly reduce our customers' CCOE, including the integration of energy storage and energy management functionality into our systems, and have made investments to realize those opportunities, enabling our customers to make intelligent energy choices by addressing how they buy energy, how they use energy, and when they use it. We have added advanced module-level control electronics to our portfolio of technology designed to enable longer series strings and significant balance of system components cost reductions in large arrays. We offer solar panels that use micro-inverters designed to eliminate the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building and enable optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system.

Flexible Financing Options 
We have a long track record of attracting low-cost capital from diverse sources, including tax equity and debt investors. Since inception we have raised tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy systems. 
Advances in financing are playing a big part in driving increased profits and dealer loyalty. We sell our residential solar energy solutions to end customers through a variety of means, including cash and financed systems sales directly to end customers and sales to resellers, including our third-party dealer network. 
We offer financing programs that are designed to offer customers a variety of options to obtain high-efficiency solar products and systems, including loans arranged through our third-party lending partners, in some cases for no money down, or leases at competitive energy rates. Since its launch in 2011, our residential lease program, in partnership with third-party investors, provides U.S. customers SunPower systems under typically 20-year lease agreements that include system maintenance and warranty coverage, including warranties on system performance. SunPower residential lease customers have the option to purchase their leased solar systems upon the sale or transfer of their home. These financing options enhance our ability to provide individually tailored solar solutions to a broad range of residential customers.

Our commercial flat rooftop systems are designed to be lightweight and to interlock, enhancing wind resistance, and providing for secure, rapid installations. 
We offer parking lot structures designed specifically for SunPower panels, balance of system components, and inverters and in 2015 expanded our capability to design and install innovative solar structures and systems for carport applications. These systems are typically custom design-build projects that utilize standard templates and design best practices to create a solution tailored to unique site conditions. SunPower's highest efficiency panels are especially well suited to stand-alone structures, such as those found in parking lot applications, because our systems require less steel and other materials per unit of power or energy produced as compared with our competitors. 
Community Solar 
SunPower’s Community Solar program is a way for customers to obtain the benefits of solar without having any panels installed on their roofs. This enables people who live in apartments, condominiums, and other residences to go solar. These customers are part of a community of solar energy supporters who obtain their power from large solar projects built within their utility district rather than from panels on their respective rooftops. 
SunPower has a large commercial and residential customer base to leverage opportunities to expand our community solar footprint. We believe our community solar market offering fits well into long-term growth strategy, and provides a significant opportunity for growth by leveraging the existing installation base and software platform. 
Supply 
The solar power panels used in our systems and solutions are entirely sourced from Maxeon Solar during the exclusivity period under the terms of the supply agreement that we entered into with Maxeon Solar in connection with the Spin-Off. 
We also work with our suppliers and partners to ensure the reliability of our supply chain. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements, under which we have annual minimum purchase obligations. For more information about our purchase commitments and obligations, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" and "Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Technology
Smart Energy 
We see “Smart Energy” as a way to harness our world’s energy potential by connecting the most powerful and reliable solar systems on the market with an increasingly vast array of actionable data that can help our customers make smarter decisions about their energy use. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings, and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. In order to enhance the portfolio of Smart Energy solutions we offer, we plan to continue to invest in integrated technology solutions to help customers manage and optimize their CCOE measurement. 
We have also negotiated several agreements with residential and commercial energy storage providers to integrate storage technology into our residential and commercial solar solutions. By combining storage with energy management, we lower our customers' cost of energy through improvements in self-consumption, rate arbitrage, demand management, and grid and market participation. We plan to continue to work to make combined solar and storage solutions broadly commercially available.

Inverters
Every solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade AC power that is ready for use. We sell inverters manufactured by third parties, some of which are SunPower-branded for both residential and commercial customers. Subsequent to the sale of our microinverter business in August 2018, we exclusively procure microinverters for the manufacture and distribution of AC modules and discrete MLPE system solutions for the U.S. residential market from Enphase. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters perform better in shaded applications compared to conventional string inverters and allow for optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level, enabling maximum energy production by the solar system.
We are working with Enphase to develop next generation microinverters for use with our high efficiency solar panels in order to enhance our portfolio of Smart Energy solutions. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters can convert direct current generated by the solar panel into alternating current, enabling optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system. 
Warranties
SunPower provides a workmanship warranty of up to 25 years from installation and a 25-year standard warranty for previously SunPower-manufactured microinverters. We also warrant our installed systems for defective materials and workmanship for periods ranging up to 25 years as well as provide a separate system output performance warranty to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation monitoring and maintenance services. We pass through to customers warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components such as solar panels, monitoring equipment and inverters. For such components, our warranties may exceed the warranty coverage from the original equipment manufacturers. For solar energy systems we do not install directly, we receive workmanship warranties from our solar partners.
Customers
Our scope and scale allow us to deliver solar solutions across all segments, ranging from consumer homeowners to the largest commercial and governmental entities. Our customers typically include investors, financial institutions, project developers, electric utilities, independent power producers, commercial and governmental entities, production home builders, residential owners, and small commercial building owners. We leverage a combination of direct sales as well as a broad partner ecosystem to efficiently reach our global customer base.
We work with development, construction, system integration, and financing companies to deliver our solar power products and solutions to wholesale sellers, retail sellers, and retail users of electricity. In the United States, commercial and electric utility customers typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. End-user customers typically pay the investors and financing companies over an extended period of time based on energy they consume from the solar power systems, rather than paying for the full capital cost of purchasing the solar power systems. Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company, and operated as central-station solar power plants. In addition, our third-party dealer network and our new homes division have deployed thousands of SunPower rooftop solar power systems to residential customers. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue" for our significant customers. 
Competition
The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to:
•GAF Energy, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, REC Group, SunRun, Inc., Sunnova Energy International Inc., Tesla, Inc., Borrego, EDF Renewables, Mortenson, Ameresco, and Standard Solar.
We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.
Table of Contents

In addition, universities, research institutions, and other companies have brought to market alternative technologies, such as thin-film solar technology, which compete with our PV technology in certain applications. Furthermore, the solar power market in general competes with other energy providers such as electricity produced from conventional fossil fuels supplied by utilities and other sources of renewable energy such as wind, hydro, biomass, solar thermal, and emerging distributed generation technologies such as micro-turbines, sterling engines and fuel cells.
We believe that the key competitive factors in the market for solar energy management solutions, including systems, storage, and software are:
•total system price;
•levelized cost of energy (LCOE) evaluation;
•customer cost of energy (CCOE) evaluation;
•power, efficiency, and performance under realistic operating conditions;
•aesthetic appearance of solar panels and systems;
•wind, snow, and structural load capability;
•speed and ease of installation through modular solutions such as our Helix system; 
•dealer and installer training and operational excellence;
•high-productivity sales and commissioning software tools for dealers;
•leveraging extensive fleet data for reliability;
•engagement with end customer community;
•strength of distribution relationships;
•availability of third-party financing and investments;
•established sales channels to customers;
•bankability, strength, and reputation of our company; and
•warranty protection, quality, and customer service.
We believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these elements, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines, greater technical service, and support capabilities, and financial resources. For more information on risks related to our competition, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The increase in the global supply of solar cells and panels, and increasing competition, may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of such products, limiting our ability to sell our differentiated panels at a premium, causing us to lose sales or market share, resulting in lower revenues, earnings, and cash flows."

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights. "SunPower" and the "SunPower" logo are our registered trademarks in countries throughout the world for use with solar cells, solar panels, energy monitoring systems, inverters, and mounting systems. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “SunPower Equinox,” “SunPower Giving,” “SunPower Horizons,” “Bottle the Sun,” “Demand Better Solar,” “EDDiE,” “EnergyLink,” “Equinox,” “Experiential Learning. Expanding Opportunities.,” “Helix,” “InvisiMount,” “Light on Land,” “PowerGuard,” “PowerLight,” “Powering a Brighter Tomorrow,” “Smarter Solar,” “Solar Showdown,” “Sol,” “SunTile,” "SunVault," "OneRoof," “The Planet's Most Powerful Solar,” and “The Power of One” in certain countries. We are seeking and will continue to seek registration of the "SunPower" trademark and other trademarks in additional countries as we believe is appropriate. As of January 3, 2021, we held registrations for 26 trademarks in the United States, and had 6 trademark registration applications pending. We also held 26 trademark registrations and had no trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We typically require our business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells, technology, or business plans. We typically enter into proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, and joint venture partners.
We own multiple patents and patent applications that cover aspects of the technology in the solar panels, mounting products, and electrical and electronic systems that we sell. We continue to file for and receive new patent rights on a regular basis. The lifetime of a utility patent typically extends for 20 years from the date of filing with the relevant government authority. We assess appropriate opportunities for patent protection of those aspects of our technology, designs, methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages to us, and for licensing opportunities of new technologies relevant to our business. As of January 3, 2021, we held 565 patents in the United States (353 licensed to Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd.), which will expire at various times through 2039, and had 200 U.S. patent applications pending (152 licensed to Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd.). We also held 149 patents and had 50 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. We additionally rely on trade secret rights to protect proprietary information and know-how. We therefore typically require employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect them.
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We depend on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights," "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer," and "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses."
Regulations
Public Policy Considerations
Different public policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption and use of solar power and energy storage. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net energy metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether, while others are scheduled to be extended or expanded. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power or energy storage system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system or stored by their energy storage system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net energy metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity.
Table of Contents

In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted (and subsequently expanded) renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources. Some states additionally mandate that a certain portion of that eligible renewable energy must be distributed generation. In addition, many states have adopted community solar programs and energy storage mandates. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The reduction, modification or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results," "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services," and "Changes in international trade policies, tariffs, or trade disputes could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins, results of operations, and cash flows."
Environmental Regulations
We use, generate, and discharge toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our research and development, and construction activities. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe that we have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business and expect to obtain all necessary environmental permits for future activities. We believe that we have properly handled our hazardous materials and wastes and have appropriately remediated any contamination at any of our premises. We are currently not subject to any litigation pertaining to environment regulations and cost of compliance with applicable regulations is expected to be commensurate with our historical spend and other companies in the industry. 
In addition to the Company’s existing environmental compliance initiatives, we have also appointed new roles and engaged additional resources to provide comprehensive oversight, and reporting, of the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) components across all processes and business units. Additionally, as part of our commitment to energy sustainability, we are targeting to publish our sustainability report during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. This report will describe the Company's energy sustainability strategies and address other environmental matters such as waste minimization, minimization of impact on natural resources, and recycling.

The licensees of the Rhum field are Serica (50%, operator) and the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC UK”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%), an Iranian government-owned corporation. Under the terms of the Bruce Rhum Agreement, the Rhum field owners pay a proportion of the operating costs of the Bruce field facilities calculated on a gas throughput basis.
In November 2018, the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) granted a conditional license to BPEOC and Serica authorizing provision of services to the Rhum field following the re-imposition of US secondary sanctions. The principal condition of the license is that the ownership of shares in IOC UK by Naftiran Intertrade Company Limited (the trading branch of the NIOC) are transferred into and held in a Jersey-based trust, thereby ensuring that the Iranian government does not derive any economic benefit from the Rhum field so long as US sanctions against these entities remain in place. IOC UK’s interest is managed by an independent management company established by the trust and referred to as the “Rhum Management Company” (“RMC”). Where necessary TEP UK liaises with RMC in relation to the Bruce Rhum Agreement and TEP UK expects to continue liaising with RMC on the same basis in 2021.
In January 2021, OFAC renewed the conditional license to Serica authorizing the provision of services to the Rhum field, until January 31, 2023, subject to early termination if the trust arrangements described above should terminate. In addition, OFAC confirmed that, to the extent that the license remains valid and Serica represents that the conditions set out in the license are met, activities and transactions of non-US persons involving the Rhum field or the Bruce field, including in relation to the operation of the trust, IOC UK and RMC will not be exposed to US secondary sanctions with respect to Iran.
IOC UK’s share of costs incurred under the Bruce Rhum Agreement have been paid to TEP UK in 2020 by RMC. In 2020, based upon TEP UK’s 1% interest in the Bruce Field Joint Venture and income from the net cash flow sharing arrangement with Serica, gross revenue to TEP UK from IOC UK’s share of the Rhum field resulting from the Bruce Rhum Agreement was approximately £5.18 million. This amount was used to offset operating costs on the Bruce field and as such, generated no net profit to TEP UK. TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2021.
TEP UK is also party to an agreement with Serica whereby TEP UK uses reasonable endeavors to evacuate Rhum NGL from the St Fergus Terminal (the “Rhum NGL Agreement”). TEP UK provides this service subject to Serica having title to all of the Rhum NGL to be evacuated and Serica having a valid license from OFAC for the activity. The service is provided on a cost basis, and TEP UK charges a monthly handling fee that generates an income of approximately £35,400 per annum relating to IOC UK’s 50% stake in the Rhum field. After costs, TEP UK realizes little profit from this arrangement. TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2021.

Patents & Trademarks
The Total Group paid approximately €5,000 to Iranian authorities related to various patents. These patents have since been abandoned so that no payment should be made in 2021. In addition, the Total Group could make small payments in 2021 to Iranian authorities related to the maintenance and protection of trademarks and designs in this country. These payments are made in accordance with US regulation (Section 560.509 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations).

How SunPower develops, attracts and retains personnel
With our mission To Change the Way Our World is Powered, we work to attract top talent to join the SunPower team.

We are dedicated to creating a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment where each person delivers their best every day. We believe our work environment fosters a rich, equitable culture that allows us to make an impact on our world. 
SunPower employees are responsible for understanding our vision and values, and how their actions support the achievement of our vision on a daily basis. We drive high levels of performance and improvement on a quarterly basis through our long-standing tradition of management by objective, with a clear link back to our core values: Deliver a Superior experience, Be Accountable, Do The Right Thing, Innovate Relentlessly, and Act Fast and Nimble. Our employees generally receive feedback and coaching from their managers on at least a quarterly basis, ensuring ongoing development and providing opportunities to outline career aspirations and development plans. 
Attraction and retention of key employees contributes to our ability to remain competitive, and we have a comprehensive total rewards system to help ensure we are compensating and rewarding our employees in line with market practice, providing a competitive benefits programs, and providing flexibility through programs like our Volunteer Time Off initiative. Our pay for performance philosophy helps align employee interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding achievements that meet or exceed corporate goals, and grants of stock-based awards under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan are intended to align compensation with the price performance of our common stock.
The importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion
SunPower is an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment, and creating a strong culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Our differences make us stronger. We are diverse in race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, faith, veteran status, ability, and much more. We celebrate these differences. The way we identify ourselves also extends beyond these foundations to diversity of thought and perspective, a range of approaches to problem-solving, and different life experiences. The value we place on diversity is reflected in the way we treat each other and our communities.
Together we are powerful. The power of inclusion is in valuing everyone and their unique contribution. It is important for all our employees to be respected, welcomed, and feel that they are part of something bigger. A culture of inclusion leads to more innovation, healthier working relationships, better decision-making, more fulfilled employees, a better ability to serve our customers, and ultimately a company that does well by doing good.

A strong safety culture
We are committed to protecting the environment, providing a safe workplace, and protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and other stakeholders. We pursue continual improvement by setting targets and objectives to promote health and safety while aiming to conserve natural resources, minimize waste, and provide an environmentally friendly workplace. We work to ensure that all jobs and processes are planned and performed in a safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly manner.
The health and safety of our employees and contractors continues to be a top priority even more so with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to protect our employees and contractors, we took and continue to take proactive and aggressive actions, starting with the earliest signs of the outbreak to adopt social distancing policies at all our locations, including working from home and suspending travel. We transitioned to work from home with flexible work policies, and most of our non-installation workforce has been working from home since March 2020, and is expected to continue to do so until at least July 2021. 
Seasonal Trends and Economic Incentives
Our business is subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations including changes in weather patterns and economic incentives, such as changes to the amount and timing of ITC, among others. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues realized during the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The construction of solar power systems or installation of solar power components and related revenue may decline during cold winter months. In the United States, many customers make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of project sales, construction schedules, and revenue recognition of certain projects, which may significantly impact the quarterly profile of our results of operations. We may also retain certain development projects on our balance sheet for longer periods of time than in preceding periods in order to optimize the economic value we receive at the time of sale in light of market conditions, which can fluctuate after we have committed to projects. Delays in disposing of projects, or changes in amounts realized on disposition, may lead to significant fluctuations to the period-over-period profile of our results of operations and our cash available for working capital needs.
