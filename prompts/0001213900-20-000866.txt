ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
-------------------------------------------------+---------

 
We are an independent junior oil sands exploration and development company headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Our immediate corporate focus is to develop the existing oil sands land base in the Peace River oil sands area of Alberta. Our principal office is located at Suite 700, 10150 – 100 Street NW, Edmonton, Alberta T5J 0P6, our telephone number is (780) 409-8144 and our fax number is (780) 409-8146. Deep Well Oil & Gas, Inc. is a Nevada corporation and our common stock trades on the OTC Marketplace under the symbol DWOG. We maintain a website at www.deepwelloil.com. The contents of our website are not part of this annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (this “Annual Report”).
 
Formation of Organization
 
Deep Well Oil & Gas, Inc. was originally incorporated on July 18, 1988 under the laws of the state of Nevada as Worldwide Stock Transfer, Inc. and in connection with a plan of reorganization, effective on September 10, 2003, the Company was reorganized and changed its name to Deep Well Oil & Gas, Inc. Deep Well Oil & Gas, Inc. has two wholly owned subsidiaries through which it conducts its operations: (1) Northern Alberta Oil Ltd. (“Northern”) acquired on June 7, 2005, and incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), Canada on September 18, 2003; and (2) Deep Well Oil & Gas (Alberta) Ltd., incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), Canada on September 15, 2005.
Business Development 
 
Our main objective is to develop our oil sands lease holdings located in the Peace River oil sands area of North Central Alberta, Canada, (also known as our Sawn Lake oil sands properties) using thermal recovery technologies. Currently, we have received approval from the Alberta Energy Regulator (“AER”) for two thermal recovery projects located on our Sawn Lake properties.
 
Over the last 3 years we have successfully applied to the AER to continue the best sections of our oil sands properties past their initial expiry dates, where resources were identified. Under the oil sands lease continuation regulations an operator or leaseholder must demonstrate certain levels of exploration and development by providing the AER with drilling, coring and seismic data within a certain timeframe in order to maintain the lease past its expiry date. For more information regarding our oil sands properties see “Oil and Gas Properties” under Item 2 “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
In late July of 2013 we entered into a Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage Demonstration Project Joint Operating Agreement (the “SAGD Project”) where we have a 25% working interest with one joint venture partner. In late July of 2013 we entered into a farmout agreement (the “Farmout Agreement”) with an additional joint venture partner (the “Farmee”). The SAGD Project produced bitumen for 18 months, demonstrating the productive capability of our Sawn Lake reservoir. In 2016 a majority of our Company’s Joint Venture partners voted to temporarily suspend operations for the SAGD Project. In early May of 2016, an amended application was submitted to the AER for an expansion of the existing SAGD Project facility site which would potentially increase the operations up to a total of eight SAGD well pairs. The amended application sought approval to expand the current SAGD Project facility site to 3,200 bopd (100% basis). Regulatory approval was received in December 2017 for a commercial expansion of the existing SAGD Project facility site where we have a 25% working interest. It is anticipated that only five SAGD well pairs will be needed to achieve the 3,200 bopd production level. For more information regarding our SAGD Project and our Farmout Agreement, see “Present Activities - Peace River Oil Sands, Alberta Canada (Sawn Lake Properties)” under Item 2 “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Principal Product 
 
We are engaged in the identification, acquisition, exploration and development of oil sands prospects. Exploration and development for commercially viable production of any oil sands company includes a high degree of risk, which careful evaluation, experience and factual knowledge may not eliminate.
Sawn Lake Oil Sands Properties – Peace River Oil Sands, Alberta, Canada
 
Currently, we have working interests in seven oil sands leases ranging from 25% to 100% in the Peace River oil sands area of Alberta, where we are the operator of five leases. The focus of our Company’s operations is to develop the oil sands reservoir to establish proven reserves and to determine the best technology under which the oil can be produced from our Sawn Lake properties in order to generate positive cash flow. For further information on our oil sands projects see Item 2 “Oil and Gas Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Market and Distribution of Product
 
On lands where we have a 25% working interest, the operator of the SAGD Project markets and distributes all oil produced from the SAGD Project facility. Production from the SAGD Project was trucked and sold to marketing facilities in the Peace River area of Alberta. A majority of the Joint Venture partners voted to temporarily suspend operations for the SAGD Project at the end of February 2016.
 
On lands where we are the operator, we intend to sell our oil production under both short-term (less than one year) and long-term (one year or more) agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Under both short-term and long-term contracts, typically either the entire contract (in the case of short-term contracts) or the price provisions of the contract (in the case of long-term contracts) are renegotiated in intervals ranging in frequency from daily to annual. At this time, we have no production on any of the lands where we are the operator and therefore, we have no short-term or long-term contracts. We will adopt specific sales and marketing plans once production is achieved on lands where we are designated as the operator. The operator of our joint SAGD Project marketed and distributed all oil produced from our joint SAGD Project.
 
Market pricing for bitumen is seasonal, with lower prices in and around the calendar year-end being the norm due to lower demand for asphalt and other bitumen-derived products. By necessity, bitumen is regularly blended with diluent in order to facilitate its transportation through pipelines to North American markets. As such, the effective field price for bitumen is also directly impacted by the input cost of the diluent required, the demand and price of which is also seasonal in nature (higher in winter as colder temperatures necessitate more diluent for transportation). Consequently, bitumen pricing is usually weakest in and around December and not reflective of the annual average realized price or the economics of the “business” overall. We have been advised that, to price bitumen, marketers apply formulas that take as a reference point the prices published for crude oil of particular qualities such as “Western Canadian Select”, “Brent Crude Oil”, “Crude Bitumen 9 API Plant Gate”, “Edmonton Light”, “Lloydminster Blend”, or the more internationally known “West Texas Intermediate” (“WTI”).
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing with major integrated and independent energy companies for desirable oil and natural gas properties as well as for the equipment, labour and materials required to develop and operate those properties. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a worldwide basis. Our larger competitors, by reason of their size and relative financial strength, can more easily access capital markets than we can and may enjoy a competitive advantage, whereas we may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs we consider reasonable because of this competition. Larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business and handle longer periods of reduced prices of gas and oil more easily. Our competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct efficient operations, evaluate and select suitable properties, implement advanced technologies and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
 
Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of Canada and other countries as well as other factors beyond our control, including international political stability, overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas, and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources.
 
Customers
 
The operator of our SAGD Project, distributed and sold all of the oil that was produced from the SAGD Project. Production was sold to 11 different marketing facilities in Alberta.

Royalty Agreements
 
Through the acquisition of Northern, we potentially became a party to the following:
 
On December 12, 2003, Nearshore Petroleum Corporation (“Nearshore”) entered into a purported royalty agreement with Mikwec Energy Canada, Ltd. (now known as Northern) that potentially encumbers six of our oil sands leases located within our Sawn Lake properties (the “Purported 6.5% Royalty”). Nearshore claimed to have received the Purported 6.5% Royalty from Northern on the leased substances on the land interests which Northern holds in the above six oil sands leases. Nearshore was a private corporation incorporated in Alberta, Canada, and was owned and controlled by Mr. Steven P. Gawne and his wife, Mrs. Rebekah J. Gawne, who each owned 50% of Nearshore. Mr. Steven P. Gawne was the President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Deep Well from February 6, 2004 to June 29, 2005. Nearshore has subsequently transferred part or all of the Purported 6.5% Royalty to other parties. Although we continue to deny the validity of the Purported 6.5% Royalty, we determined that it was in the best interests of our shareholders to come to an arrangement to acquire most of the Purported 6.5% Royalty to prevent a potential encumbrance over our land and the possibility of future litigation resulting from these alleged royalty claims. In our fiscal year 2014, we acquired 5.5% of the Purported 6.5 % Royalty for a cost of $3.4 million. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Government Approval and Crown Royalties
 
Exploration and Production. Our operations are subject to Canadian federal and provincial governmental regulations. Such regulations include: requiring approval and licenses for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells and the method and ability to produce the wells, surface usage and the restoration of land upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production from our wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation regulations, including the regulation of in-situ recovery processes, the size of spacing units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the ability to produce oil and gas.
 
Investment Canada Act. The Investment Canada Act of 1985, as amended, requires notification and/or review by the government of Canada in certain cases, including but not limited to, the acquisition of control, directly or indirectly, of a Canadian Business by a non-Canadian. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of a working interest in a property that contains recoverable reserves will be treated as the acquisition of an interest in a “business” and may be subject to either notification or review, depending on the size of the interest being acquired and the asset size of the business.
 
Crown Royalties and Incentives. Crown royalties are determined by provincial and federal government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada and Alberta have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays, tax credits and drilling royalty credits. These incentives are for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally increase cash flow. Oil sands royalties in Alberta are calculated using a sliding scale for royalty rates ranging from 1% to 9% pre-payout and 25% to 40% post-payout depending on the world oil price. Project “payout” refers to the point in which we earn sufficient revenues to recover all of the allowed costs for the project plus a return allowance. The base royalty starts at 1% and increases for every dollar the world oil price, as reflected by the WTI, is priced above $55 per barrel, to a maximum of 9% when oil is priced at $120 per barrel or greater. The net royalty starts at 25% and increases for every dollar oil is priced above $55 per barrel to 40% when oil is priced at $120 or higher.
 
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental laws and regulations pursuant to Canadian local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with oil and gas industry operations. Legislation requires that well and facility sites be monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury, clean-up costs and other environmental and property damages as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Accordingly, we could be liable or could be required to cease production on properties if environmental damage occurs. Although we maintain insurance coverage, the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business. Furthermore, future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur that result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We maintain commercial property and general liability insurance coverage on the properties we operate. We also maintain operators extra expense insurance which provides coverage for well control incidents specifically relating to regaining control of a well, seepage, pollution, clean-up and containment. No coverage is maintained with respect to any fine or penalty required to be paid due to a violation of the regulations set out by the federal and provincial regulatory authorities. We are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment.
