Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
References herein to “CCUR Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to CCUR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise.
 
We are a holding company owning and seeking to own subsidiaries engaged in a variety of business operations. Following the disposition of our legacy operating businesses in calendar year 2017, we began identifying business alternatives to redeploy the proceeds of such divestitures. As of June 30, 2020, we had two existing operating segments: (i) Merchant cash advance (“MCA”) operations, conducted primarily through our subsidiary LM Capital Solutions, LLC (d/b/a “LuxeMark Capital”) (“LMCS”), and (ii) real estate operations, conducted through our subsidiary Recur Holdings LLC (“Recur”) and its subsidiaries.
 
As of June 30, 2020, we held an 80% interest in LMCS, with the remaining 20% held by AZOKKB, LLC (formerly named LuxeMark Capital, LLC and herein referenced as “Old LuxeMark”). Through LMCS, we manage a network of MCA originators and syndicate participants who provide those originators with capital by purchasing participation interests in or co-funding MCA transactions. In addition, we provide loans to MCA originators, the proceeds of which are used by the MCA originators to fund MCAs. LMCS’ daily operations are led by the three principals of Old LuxeMark. CCUR provides operational, accounting and legal support to LMCS. On July 17, 2020, we entered into a series of agreements with Old LuxeMark pursuant to which our interest in LMCS was reduced from 80% to 51%. After the repayment of the outstanding balance of the Master Promissory Note issued by LMCS to the Company, Old LuxeMark has the right to purchase the remaining 51% equity interest in LMCS for nominal consideration.
 
Recur provides commercial loans to local, regional, and national builders, developers, and commercial landowners and also acquires, owns, and manages a portfolio of real property for development. Recur does not provide consumer mortgages.
 
In addition to our MCA and real estate operating segments, we actively evaluate acquisitions of additional businesses or operating assets, either as part of an expansion of our current operating segments or establishment of a new operating segment, in an effort to reinvest the proceeds of our calendar year 2017 business dispositions and maximize use of other assets such as our net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards. We may also seek additional capital and financing to support the purchase of additional businesses and/or to provide additional working capital to further develop our operating segments. We believe that these activities will enable us to identify, acquire, and grow businesses and assets that will maximize value for all our stockholders.
 
In support of the Company’s goal of expanding its existing operations and acquiring additional operating assets, we work with our external asset manager to prudently invest the excess capital of the Company so that the capital of the Company is preserved for future acquisitions, while also generating a return for stockholders. Our external asset manager allocates the investment assets of the Company while balancing the amount of liquid resources needed to continue to expand and support our current operations. Our external asset manager has broad investment authority to invest our excess capital resources in marketable debt and equity securities and also assists in our acquisition strategy by identifying potential acquisition targets.
 
The global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. government in March 2020 and has negatively impacted our operations, the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to “shelter-in-place,” and created significant disruption of the financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Overall Business Strategy
 
Following the divestiture of our legacy operating businesses in calendar year 2017, we have undertaken to evaluate strategic acquisitions of additional businesses or operating assets, either as part of an expansion of our current operating segments or establishment of a new operating segment, in an effort to reinvest the proceeds of our calendar year 2017 business dispositions and maximize use of other assets such as our NOL carryforwards. These alternatives have included acquiring assets or businesses unrelated to our current or historical operations; operating, growing, or acquiring additional assets or businesses related to our current or historical operations; or winding down or selling our existing operations. We currently operate two segments in the real estate and MCA industries. We continue to look for businesses and opportunities that have positive cash flow and experienced management teams. We provide strategic and financial resources to our operating segments in an effort to create and operate a diversified portfolio capable of providing long-term value to our stockholders, which we believe includes the successful utilization of our deferred tax assets.
 
We actively evaluate business opportunities including acquisitions of additional businesses or operating assets, either as part of an expansion of our current operating segments or for the establishment of new operating segments. We seek to identify fairly- or under-valued businesses or assets from a variety of sources. Our Asset Management Committee, among other activities, continues the work of the former Investment Committee by providing oversight of the Company’s acquisition process, and our senior management spends a significant portion of its time evaluating potential acquisition and strategic opportunities. In addition, in February 2019, the Company entered into a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”), as amended, with CIDM LLC, which was subsequently assigned to CIDM II, LLC (“CIDM” or the “Asset Manager”) under which CIDM provides consulting services and advice to the Board of Directors and the Company’s management regarding, among other things, our acquisition strategy. Our external asset manager also invests some of the excess capital resources of the Company in marketable debt, and equity securities to preserve resources needed to acquire operating assets and protect against inflation and similar risks. The Asset Manager is an entity managed by Julian Singer, the managing member of JDS1, LLC, our largest stockholder.
 
In connection with our overall business strategy, we may raise capital in the form of debt or equity securities (including preferred stock) or a combination thereof as part of any proposed acquisition that we may pursue, or to use as additional investment in or working capital for our existing operating segments. We do not focus on a specific industry, which, we believe, allows us to be opportunistic and flexible.
 
Competition
 
Our continuing business strategy is focused on identifying, acquiring, and operating fairly- to under-valued businesses that have growth potential. Due to current market conditions, we have faced significant competition from strategic and, in particular, financial buyers which, in many instances, has raised seller valuation expectations above what we consider to be attractive levels for us and our stockholders. Further, the increasing use of special purpose acquisition vehicles has created more competition for us as we seek to leverage the advantages generated by being a public company. We continue to believe that additional fairly- and under-valued opportunities exist and are attainable, and we do not intend to pursue what we consider to be over-valued businesses and assets that we believe may not deliver the levels of returns that we target.
Real Estate Operations
 
The Company began developing its real estate operations during the second half of fiscal year 2018 and operates its real estate segment through Recur. To date, Recur’s operations have consisted of providing commercial loans secured by real property and investing in development opportunities in selected markets, primarily where we have access to experienced real estate resources. We continue to seek and identify real estate opportunities that we believe offer attractive returns over 12- to 18-month periods and expect to continue to make such investments for the foreseeable future.
Commercial Real Estate Finance Operation
 
Our real estate operations are operated through Recur and through fiscal year 2020 have primarily consisted of making a number of loans secured by real property. At June 30, 2020, real estate loans totaling approximately $1.7 million remained outstanding under Recur’s loan portfolio. The loans are scheduled to mature at various dates throughout our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. We do not make consumer mortgage loans.

While the Company is continuing to review a variety of loan opportunities and expects to continue to make loans on an opportunistic basis, we do not expect there to be a significant increase in general overhead expenses associated with the continuation of these operations, as our management team has prior experience in this sector and believes it can manage the business without adding additional staffing resources. The Company will continue to seek out these types of transactions to increase our profitability within our commercial real estate finance operation.
 
Real Property Development
 
The Company is also involved in identifying, acquiring, entitling, and selling real property as part of Recur’s real estate operations. Through a variety of resources available to the Company in selected markets, the Company is presented with opportunities to purchase real property for development as either residential, commercial, or mixed-use projects. Drawing upon internal and external resources, the Company focuses on parcels of real property that are suitable for development but are not currently entitled for the desired end uses. The Company has demonstrated the ability to identify, evaluate, and consummate the acquisition of such parcels on an expedited basis. We believe that this ability and the strength of our financial condition position the Company in a favorable light when dealing with landowners, resulting in the Company being able to acquire such parcels at or below fair market value. By undertaking and performing the entitlement process, which involves, in most instances, rezoning, utility access, planning, and other governmental and quasi-governmental approvals, we strive to increase the value of the parcels we purchase, and hold such parcels for sale to end users such as national, regional, and local builders and developers, as well as other commercial entities. As of June 30, 2020, we have capitalized approximately $3.6 million of land under development on our balance sheet. As these operations grow, we plan to leverage our internal and external resources and potential strategic partnerships to help source continued opportunities for this business.
 
To date, we have funded our real estate operations primarily from our balance sheet with cash on hand. As we continue to grow our real estate operations, the Company will also continue to review the use of its cash and other financing alternatives available to it in an effort to finance this operation in the most cost-effective manner. Such review will include an assessment of the details of each project, including the estimated duration of the project and an assessment of current interest rates and other opportunities to deploy the Company’s cash that are presented to the Company outside of its real estate segment.
 
Competition
 
Our real property development business is dependent on our ability to identify suitable parcels of real property, in the markets in which we operate, that can be entitled and sold for their intended use at a premium to our purchase prices. To date, we have focused our real property development efforts in North Carolina. Given the robust nature of the North Carolina real estate market in general, we face competition from a variety of sources including local and regional developers as well as national, regional, and local builders. While these parties are also customers for our properties once they are entitled, several of these entities have internal resources greater than those of the Company and are potentially capable of identifying and acquiring such properties.
 
MCA Business
 
The Company operates its MCA business through LMCS. MCAs have evolved as an alternative capital source primarily for small businesses and LMCS generates multiple revenue streams within the MCA industry. In a typical MCA, a merchant sells an amount of its future receivables, expected to be generated from future sales, to an MCA originator (also referred to as a “funder”) at a discount in exchange for a lump sum payment from the funder. The merchant then remits a portion of its sales receipts, or an amount equal to this portion, often daily, via automated clearing house (“ACH”) transfer, until the funder has received the full amount of the future receipts it has purchased. MCA funders often offer a streamlined application and approval process in connection with the provision of MCAs, making them a widely used alternative financing source for small businesses.
 
MCAs are not structured as loans or sales of securities; instead, they are structured as sales and purchases of assets, specifically future receivables, and the assignment of rights related to such assets. Small businesses typically seek these advances for working capital purposes to finance purchases of inventory or equipment, or to address other immediate business needs.

Funding of MCAs
 
In December 2018, CCUR Holdings began participating in the MCA industry by indirectly advancing funds to merchants through a third-party originator that is a leader in the MCA industry. As a part of our acquisition of the assets of Old LuxeMark (the “LuxeMark Acquisition”), the CCUR Holdings MCA portfolio was assigned to LMCS and was credited against a $10.4 million loan that CCUR Holdings provided to LMCS as a part of the transaction. LMCS continues to generate income through its evolving MCA portfolio and to use funds from CCUR Holdings’ loan to, among other things, purchase additional MCA interests. The intercompany loan matures in February 2024 and bears interest at the minimum applicable federal rate for mid-term investments.
 
Syndication/Co-Funding Business
 
We have observed a strong demand by small businesses for MCAs and believe that this demand will continue, although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a deterioration of liquidity across many existing MCA customers and modification of underwriting standards for new customers. Among all of the small businesses surveyed in the 2019 Small Business Credit Survey, 32% of those applying for funding applied to non-bank funding sources, including MCA originators and other non-traditional sources, such as retail/payments processors or peer-to-peer lenders, an increase from 24% in 2017 and 19% in 2016. The increased difficulty for small businesses in accessing traditional bank loans after the 2008 recession was addressed in some part by smaller banks but, according to the Merchant Cash Advance/Small Business Financing Industry Report published by Bryan Capital LLC in January 2016, the decline in the number of small banks over recent years and data technology advancements have propelled the alternative funding market, including MCAs. These factors have contributed to the expansion of the MCA market beyond providing funding to businesses with high risk profiles.
 
A frequent issue experienced within the MCA industry is finding enough capital to meet the strong merchant demand for alternative financing sources. LMCS has found an opportunity to fill that niche by connecting syndicate participants that have available capital with funders that have established high-quality MCA processes and procedures and need capital to meet merchant demands. As a part of the LuxeMark Acquisition, the principals of Old LuxeMark operate LMCS day to day, providing LMCS with their MCA expertise to vet and select funders with underwriting, servicing, and collection processes necessary to provide syndicate participants with the best opportunities to provide capital in the MCA space.
 
LMCS receives compensation for its administrative and servicing functions such as assisting with the purchase of MCA participation interests in funder facilities, identifying potential facilities based on a syndicate participant’s criteria, providing consultation in connection with the negotiation of related agreements, and assisting with status reports and other reporting requests.
 
Leads Business
 
LMCS facilitates the targeted dissemination of funders’ merchant applications within a select group of partner funders, giving the group of funders the ability to fund MCAs that might otherwise have remained unfunded, thus providing merchants a higher chance of securing funding. LMCS receives a fee from funders for its services in disseminating unfunded MCA applications.
Funder Loans
 
LMCS has also, in certain instances, provided direct funding to funders through secured loans. Providing funders with access to these additional funds provides several measurable benefits; specifically, it (i) provides the funder with the capital needed to identify and fund additional MCAs, which in turn also generates greater participation opportunities for our syndicate participants, (ii) provides us with interest income as an additional revenue stream, and (iii) provides us with a competitive advantage by furthering our business relationships with selected funders.
Competition
 
We face competition from providers of other competing forms of alternative funding that target the same type of small businesses served by the MCA industry and may also compete for use of the capital of potential syndication participants interested in deploying capital in the alternative funding market. While the MCA industry has grown beyond meeting the needs of high-risk businesses and become more well known within the alternative funding market, some of the initial stigma and hesitation towards MCAs remains, and this may provide a competitive advantage to providers of other forms of alternative funding.

We do not currently operate as a funder that originates MCAs. However, because our services are connected to our partner network of funders, other funders in the MCA industry can create a competitive risk for our funders and thus our business. The decreasing stigma and recognition of the critical needs of small businesses met by MCA funding has made it an attractive area for well-recognized companies that have not traditionally participated in the alternative funding market. Some of these companies have created MCA divisions to provide MCA funding as a complementary service to their existing small business customers. For example, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), a publicly traded e-commerce platform that offers multiple products and services to merchant businesses such as a payment system, has begun offering MCAs to its merchant customers. According to the Merchant Cash Advance/Small Business Financing Industry Report published by Bryant Capital LLC in January 2016, providers of payment processing and financial services like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Square (NYSE:SQ) and Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) have also started experimenting with MCA or other small loan or advance offerings to their respective small business customers.
 
As noted above, a significant issue within the MCA industry is procuring enough capital to meet merchant demand for MCAs. The entry of larger and established companies to the MCA market provides these companies with the advantage of (i) established name recognition, (ii) an existing merchant customer base that can be readily accessed for MCA offerings, potentially producing more volume and reducing third party fees owed for merchant advertising and recruiting, (iii) easier access to capital to support significant MCA volume, (iv) increased access to merchants’ financial and payment data, and (v) in the event that regulatory changes cause significant structural changes to the MCA industry (as discussed herein in the “Risk Factors” section), these companies may have greater resources in place to quickly adapt to such changes or be able to absorb the costs of such changes.
 
While the entry of established companies into the MCA market may increase the competition faced by our business, it also provides a discernable benefit as these companies bring increased credibility and attention to the MCA industry and highlight the availability of MCAs as a viable funding source to a broader array of small businesses.
 
Effect of Governmental Regulations
 
The MCA industry is subject to laws and regulations that apply to businesses in general, including laws and regulations that address information privacy, unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and credit reporting, among other legal requirements.
 
Because MCAs are structured as purchases and sales of assets, instead of loans, the MCA industry has not historically been subject to specific laws and regulations, such as licensing requirements, applicable to lenders. Recently, however, there has been increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the MCA industry, which could result in the enactment of specific laws and regulations.
 
In 2018, for example, the governor of California signed SB 1235, which requires MCA originators to disclose to the merchant certain information regarding the MCA, including the total dollar cost of the MCA expressed as an annualized rate, at the time an offer for the MCA is extended. In some other states, regulators have begun investigations to determine whether regulation is needed and, if so, the type of regulation needed for the MCA industry. The Federal Trade Commission, pursuant to its authority to regulate unfair or deceptive acts or practices, has also begun a review of the MCA industry to identify potential regulatory concerns. Any resulting regulation may require us to make significant changes to our business structure or may decrease the revenues achieved through our multiple MCA-related revenue streams.
