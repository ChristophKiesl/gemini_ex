Item 1. Business.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
COVID – 19 Pandemic
 
The financial statements contained in this Report as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2020. Since early 2020, economies throughout the world have been severely disrupted by the effects of the quarantines, business closures and the reluctance of individuals to leave their homes as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) and this may limit access to our management, support staff and professional advisors. In particular, the oil and gas market has been severely impacted by the negative effects of the coronavirus because of the substantial and abrupt decrease in the demand for oil and gas globally. In addition, the capital markets have been disrupted and our efforts to raise necessary capital will likely be adversely impacted by the outbreak of the virus and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the disruptions caused by it will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading this report on Form 10-K, including our discussion of our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the outbreak of Covid-19. These factors may not only impact our operations, financial condition and our ability to raise capital to support our operations but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Furthermore, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Overview
 
Since 2009 we had planned to pursue the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the United States and in the Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea (the “Nicaraguan Concessions” or “Concessions”), which contain a total of approximately 1.4 million acres. We sold our wholly-owned subsidiary Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc. in 2012 and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Infinity Oil and Gas of Wyoming, Inc., was administratively dissolved in 2009. We have abandoned our efforts relating to the Concessions, as explained below.

We also began assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives involving the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the United States, including the possibility of acquiring businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil and gas in the United States. As a result, on July 31, 2019 we acquired an option (the “Option”) from Core Energy, LLC, a closely held company (“Core”), to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for oil & gas properties, subject to overriding royalties to third parties, in the Central Kansas Uplift geological formation covering over 11,000 contiguous acres (the “Properties”). We paid a nonrefundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the purchase option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. The Company was not able to exercise the Option prior to December 31, 2020 and the parties agreed on an extension of such option and a lower purchase price as described below in more detail under “Business Strategy and Recent Development.”
 
If we are able to complete the acquisition, the purchase will include the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.
 
We intend to complete the acquisition of the Properties during the second quarter of 2021, subject to successfully obtaining adequate financing. In that regard, the Company raised approximately $2.05 million on March 26, 2021 through the issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants. The funds raised pursuant to the Convertible Preferred Stock issuance will be used to complete the acquisition and development of the Properties and to pay-off all outstanding Convertible Notes Payable. Core and the Company are finalizing the final purchase date and terms of the Properties which is expected to occur in the second quarter 2021.


We must continue to raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from available sources in the immediate future in order to fund the (i) the acquisition and development of the Properties under the Option; (ii) normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (iii) outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due, as described below. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2021.
 
We are actively pursuing new sources of debt and equity capital to fund the needs enumerated above. We intend to obtain extensions of the maturity dates for its debt and other obligations including compromises of the debt obligations. In addition, we will seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the Properties in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. We have also restructured certain obligations that were in default during 2020. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such funding, extensions or additional restructurings or on what terms.
 
Nicaragua
 
We began pursuing an oil and gas exploration opportunity offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea in 1999. Since such time, we built relationships with the Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (“INE”) and undertook the geological and geophysical research that helped us to become one of only six companies qualified to bid on offshore blocks in the first international bidding round held by INE in January 2003.
 
On March 5, 2009, we signed the contracts granting us the Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua (the “Nicaraguan Concessions” or “Concessions”). Since our acquisition of the Nicaraguan Concessions, we have conducted an environmental study and developed geological information from the reprocessing and additional evaluation of existing 2-D seismic data acquired over our Perlas and Tyra concession blocks. In April 2013, the Nicaraguan government formally approved our Environmental Impact Assessment, at which time we commenced significant activity under the initial work plan involving the acquisition of new seismic data on the two Nicaraguan Concessions. We undertook seismic shoots during late 2013 that resulted in the acquisition of new 2-D and 3-D seismic data and have reviewed it to select initial drilling sites for exploratory wells.
 
We were in default of various provisions of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra blocks for several years and the Nicaraguan Government has terminated the Concessions. We had been seeking a resolution of these defaults including the ability to extend, renew and/or renegotiate the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions with the Nicaraguan government to cure the defaults; however, the political climate and domestic issues, as well other factors, caused the Company to abandon such efforts and the Concessions in 2020. As a result, the Nicaraguan Concession agreement has been terminated and the Company has abandoned all of its efforts to extend, renew and/or renegotiate the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions with the Nicaraguan government to cure the defaults as of December 31, 2020.

Our 2020 operating objectives have focused on the resolution of obligations in default and to acquire the Properties.
 
Recent financings –
 
Issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock - On March 26, 2021, the Company issued Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), with an aggregate principal face amount of up to $2,500,000 subject to a 10% original issue discount. The Preferred Stock is, subject to certain conditions, convertible into common stock at a rate of $0.32 per share and will be subject to a 10% dividend rate per annum, payable quarterly in cash or registered common stock, subject to equity conditions. The Holders were also granted demand registration rights. The Company issued warrants in addition to the Preferred Stock investors to purchase up to 6,410,250 shares (assuming the $2.5 million offering is fully subscribed) of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.39 per share, subject to customary adjustments. The common stock purchase warrants are exercisable commencing six months after issuance on a cashless basis at the Holders discretion with a term of five years. On March 26, 2021 investors purchased Preferred Stock with an aggregate cash purchase price of $2,050,000 together with warrants to purchase a total of 5,256,410 shares of common stock. The Company will allow additional investor purchases to complete the entire offering of an aggregate principal face amount of up to $2,500,000 before closing such offering.
 
The Company intends to use the proceeds of the Convertible Preferred Stock Offering to complete the acquisition and development of the Properties, to pay-off all outstanding convertible notes payable and for general working capital.
 
Issuance of Convertible Notes Payable - On August 19, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor (the “August Investor”) for our senior unsecured convertible note payable due August 19, 2021 (the “August Note”), with an aggregate principal face amount of approximately $365,169. The August Note is, subject to certain conditions, convertible into an aggregate of 3,943,820 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $0.10 per share (the “Fixed Conversion Price”). We also issued a five-year common stock purchase warrant (the “August Warrant”) to purchase up to 800,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments. The August Warrant is immediately exercisable and on a cashless basis if the shares underlying such warrant have not been registered within 180 days after the date of issuance. The August Investor purchased such securities from the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $325,000. We also granted the August Investor certain automatic and piggy-back registration rights whereby we agreed to register the resale by the August Investor of the shares underlying the August Warrant and the conversion of the August Note.
 
The August Note bears interest at a rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, may be voluntarily repaid in cash in full or in part by us at any time in an amount equal to 115% of the principal amount of the August Note and any accrued and unpaid interest, and shall be mandatorily repaid in cash in an amount equal to 115% of the principal amount of the August Note and any accrued and unpaid interest in the event of the consummation by us of any public or private offering or other financing pursuant to which we receive gross proceeds of at least $2,500,000. The August Note is convertible at any time by the August Investor and we shall have the right to request that the August Investor convert the August Note in full or in part at the Fixed Conversion Price in the event that the VWAP (as defined in the August Note) of the Common Stock exceeds $0.75 for twenty consecutive trading days. In addition, pursuant to the August Note, so long as the August Note remains outstanding, we shall not enter into any financing transactions pursuant to which the Company sells its securities at a price lower than the Fixed Conversion Price, without written consent of the August Investor.
 
The conversion of the August Note and the exercise of the August Warrant are each subject to beneficial ownership limitations such that the August Investor may not convert the August Note or exercise the August Warrant to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in the August Investor being the beneficial owner in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election of the August Investor, 9.99%) of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise, which beneficial ownership limitation may be increased or decreased up to 9.99% upon notice to us, provided that any increase in such limitation will not be effective until 61 days following notice to us.
 
We used the proceeds of the August Note to pay off $60,125 in principal balance of notes payable that were in default, to pay the $100,000 required by the Exchange Agreement (as defined and described below) and for general working capital.
 
Extinguishment of liabilities - On September 24, 2020, the Company entered into an Exchange and Settlement Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with a note holder (the “Holder”), pursuant to which the Holder agreed to exchange its 8% promissory note in the original principal amount of $1,050,000, representing outstanding principal balance of $1,000,000 and accrued and unpaid interest thereon (which totaled $542,762 as of September 24, 2020), for (i) a cash payment in the amount of $100,000 and (ii) 737,532 newly issued shares of Common Stock (the “Exchange”).
 
In connection with the Exchange Agreement, we and the Holder agreed to terminate the following agreements: (i) the preemptive rights agreement, dated as of December 27, 2013, between the Company and the Holder, (ii) the revenue sharing agreement, dated as of May 30, 2014, between the Company and the Holder and (iii) the indemnity agreement, dated as of December 27, 2013, between the Company and the Holder. Additionally, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Holder acknowledged the expiration on March 12, 2017, by its terms, of a common stock purchase warrant, issued to the Holder, for the purchase of up to 100,000 shares of Common Stock. We and the Holder also agreed to provide mutual limited releases, releasing each of them from all liabilities and obligations to the other, as between them with respect to claims relating to the Note, such preemptive rights agreement, the Holder’s warrant and all other agreements relating thereto.

The closing of the Exchange occurred concurrently with the execution of the Exchange Agreement. At the closing, we made the $100,000 cash payment and issued 737,532 shares of Common Stock (valued at $132,756 based on the closing market price of the shares on the date of the Exchange) to the Holder and the underlying documents and obligations summarized above were surrendered and/or cancelled.
 
Option to Acquire Oil and Gas Properties - On July 31, 2019, we acquired an option (the “Option”) from Core Energy, LLC, a closely held company (“Core”), to purchase the production and mineral rights/leasehold for the Properties (the “Acquisition”). We paid a nonrefundable deposit of $50,000 to bind the Option, which provided us the right to acquire the Properties for $2.5 million prior to December 31, 2019. We were not able to exercise the Option prior to December 31, 2019. On September 2, 2020, we acquired a new option from Core under similar terms as the previous Option (the “New Option”). The New Option grants us the right to acquire 100% of the working and leasehold interests in the Properties at a reduced price of $900,000 at any time prior to November 1, 2020 and we agreed to immediately conduct a capital raise of between approximately $2-10 million to fund its acquisition and development of the Properties. On December 14, 2020 the parties executed an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement which extended the New Option to January 11, 2021 which the parties are currently finalizing another extension.
 
We intend to complete the acquisition of the Properties during the second quarter of 2021, subject to successfully obtaining adequate financing. In that regard, the Company raised approximately $2.05 million on March 26, 2021 through the issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock with detachable common stock purchase warrants. The funds raised pursuant to the Convertible Preferred Stock issuance will be used to complete the acquisition and development of the Properties and to pay-off all outstanding Convertible Notes Payable . Core and the Company are finalizing the final purchase date and terms of the Properties which is expected to occur in the second quarter 2021.
 

Upon completion of the Acquisition, the purchase will include the existing production equipment, infrastructure and ownership of 11 square miles of existing 3-D seismic data on the acreage. The Properties include a horizontal producing well, horizontal saltwater injection well, conventional saltwater disposal well and two conventional vertical producing wells, which currently produce from the Reagan Sand zone with an approximate depth of 3,600 feet.
 
We intend to complete the Acquisition during the second quarter 2021.
 
Competition
 
We compete in virtually all facets of our businesses with numerous other companies in the oil and gas industry, including many that have significantly greater financial and other resources. Such competitors will be able to pay more for desirable oil and gas leases and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit.
 
Our business strategy includes highly competitive oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. We face intense competition from a large number of independent exploration and development companies as well as major oil and gas companies in a number of areas such as obtaining the capital necessary to pursue our Nicaraguan Concessions and seeking to acquire the services, equipment, labor and materials necessary to explore, operate and develop those properties. Most of our competitors have financial and technological resources substantially exceeding those available to us. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing and operating profitable the Concessions in the face of this competition.
 
Government Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
 
General
 
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including, among others, laws and regulations relating to energy, environment, conservation and tax. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations.

The following discussion contains summaries of certain laws and regulations and is qualified as mentioned above.
 
Environmental and Land Use Regulation
 
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment affect our operations and costs. The areas affected include:
 

● | unit production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions, spill prevention and the disposal of produced water; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | capital costs to drill development wells resulting from expenses primarily related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and other oil and natural gas exploration wastes; 
● | capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities; 
● | operational costs associated with ongoing compliance and monitoring activities; and 
● | exit costs for operations that we are responsible for closing, including costs for dismantling and abandoning wells and remediating environmental impacts. 

 
The environmental and land use laws and regulations affecting oil and natural gas operations have been changed frequently in the past, and in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal fines and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. It is also possible that unanticipated developments or changes in law could cause us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect.
 
The following is a summary discussion of the framework of key environmental and land use regulations and requirements affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and transportation operations.
 
Operating Hazards and Insurance
 
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks. We were unable to maintain insurance against such potential risks and losses.
 
In addition, pollution and environmental risks are not insured. If a significant accident or other event occurs not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us.
Employees
 
We have three employees, our CEO, COO and CFO, whose compensation has primarily been in the form of restricted stock grants. All cash salaries were suspended effective January 1, 2018. We also use outside contractors to perform services.
