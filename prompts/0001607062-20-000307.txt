Item 1. BUSINESS 
 NGIO is an oncology company focused on the modulation of the immune system to treat cancer. To that end, we are developing immunotherapeutic products and vaccines based on our proprietary, patented platform technology, Ii-Key. The Ii-Key is a peptide derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II associated invariant chain (Ii) that regulates the formation, trafficking, and antigen-presenting functions of MHC class II complexes, essential for the activation of T cells in the immune response. T cells recognize antigenic epitopes when they are ‘presented’ to them by specific molecules, termed (MHC) on the surface of infected or malignant cells. We believe that this interaction activates the T cells, stimulating a TH1 response and a multicellular cascade of actions that eliminates the diseased cell and protects against future disease recurrence. We have developed a number of Ii-Key Hybrid peptides for the immunotherapeutic targeting of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) in cancer and for vaccines against infectious diseases. Ii-Key hybrid peptides can also be used to selectively activate Th2 responses and thereby induce tolerance to antigens involved in harmful immune reactions, with therapeutic applications in major market segments including diabetes, arthritis, allergy, transplant rejection, and other autoimmune diseases. We have been established to not only advance the Ii-Key core technology, but also to expand our portfolio in the field of immunotherapy and personalized medicine through partnerships and acquisitions.
 AE37 – Ii-Key/HER2/neu Hybrid Immunotherapeutic Vaccine
 NGIO is currently developing AE37 (Ii-Key-HER2/neu peptide immunotherapeutic vaccine) for the treatment of breast cancer, which is our only ongoing research and development project and is licensing patents related to AE37 for the development of effective treatments for prostate cancer to Shenzhen BioScien Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., (“Shenzhen”) as further described below. We also plan in the future to continue previous research and development or conduct new research and development of AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer, bladder cancer and other cancers as described below. In addition to research and development related to the treatment of cancer, the Company has conducted research and development of the Ii-Key immune system activation technology with respect to the development of vaccines for certain viruses as described below. In 2005 and 2006, the company conducted a Phase I trial of AE37 in breast cancer. NGIO has also conducted a Phase II trial of AE37 for prevention of recurrence of breast cancer. The company is currently working with the National Surgical Bowel & Breast Project (NSABP) to conduct a Phase II trial of AE37 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. Details of the AE37 clinical trials are provided in the following paragraphs.

Our most advanced immunotherapy vaccine candidate is AE37, an Ii-Key-Hybrid molecule that contains the HER2/neu antigenic peptide linked to the Ii-Key to enhance immune stimulation against HER2, which is expressed in numerous cancers, including breast, prostate, and bladder cancers. In 2006 we completed a Phase I clinical trial of AE37 in breast cancer, including a phase Ib safety and immunology study of AE37 in combination with GM-CSF in 16 breast cancer patients who had completed all first-line therapies and who were disease-free at the time of enrollment to the study (Holmes et al. Results of the first Phase I clinical trial of the novel Ii-Key hybrid preventive HER-2/neu peptide (AE37) vaccine. J Clin Oncol 2008;26:3426-33). The subjects of the trial were given intradermally 500 micrograms of AE37 and 125 micrograms of GM-CSF or 1000 micrograms AE37 without GM-CSF. The phase I trial was conducted by Dr. George Peoples, MD from 2005 through 2006 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C. Based on the Peer-Reviewed article, “Results of the First Phase I Clinical Trial of the Novel Ii-Key Hybrid Preventive HER-2/neu Peptide (AE37) Vaccine (for breast cancer),” published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on July 10, 2008, the Company believes that both the primary endpoint of safety and the secondary endpoint of immunogenicity were achieved. However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm such results. No serious adverse events were reported in this trial.
 In April of 2007 we commenced patient enrollment for a Phase II trial of AE37 in combination with GM-CSF on 300 patients with respect to the prevention of cancer recurrence in women who were at high risk of recurrence after undergoing successful primary standard of care breast cancer therapies and were disease free at time of enrollment (the “Phase II Trial”). The Phase II Trial was completed in 2016 and preliminary results of the Phase II Trial were published in 2016 by Elizabeth A. Mittendorf, MD, F.A.C.S. (Annals of Oncology 27: Published online March 30, 2016). The Phase II Trial was officially concluded with site close-out and database lock in November of 2019. The trial was conducted by Dr. Mittendorf at 14 sites both in the US and Europe.  The subjects of the trial were given intradermally 500 micrograms of AE37 combined with 125 micrograms GM-CSF.  The results of the Phase II Trial were published on April 22, 2020 in the Peer-Reviewed journal, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment (the “Peer-Reviewed Publication”). In the AE37 arm of this trial, the investigators found that patients with advanced stage, HER2 low-expression, and triple negative breast cancer may benefit from AE37 vaccination, and those with both advanced stage and low HER2 expression have a significant clinical benefit to AE37 vaccination, demonstrating earlier DFS plateau may be maintained for up to the ten years of follow-up. There were two serious adverse events in the Phase II Trial. There was a grade 3 serious adverse event reported for a patient in the GM-CSF arm of the trial that had a drop in ejection fraction from 50% to 45% more than two months after completion of protocol treatments. It was noted that the patient had received one full year of Herceptin adjuvant treatment prior to starting on any protocol treatments, and had reported a similar ejection fraction decline episode while on Herceptin treatment. Another patient in the Phase II Trial had serious, unexpected grade 2 bladder pain that the investigator considered serious. The investigators concluded in the Peer-Reviewed publication that the similar toxicity profiles between the AE37/GM-CSF treatment and GM-CSF alone control groups indicate that the majority of the toxicity can be attributed to the immunoadjuvant, GM-CSF. The Peer-Reviewed Publication stated that the Phase II Trial did not achieve statistical significance in meeting the primary endpoint of prevention of disease recurrence in the study population. However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm such results. The study population included 155 patients who were previously treated with Herceptin and in those patients no benefits were reported. The Peer-Reviewed Publication stated that for 78 patients in the study group with advanced disease and low HER2 expression, AE37 demonstrated a statistically significant positive effect on disease free survival. The Peer-Reviewed Publication reported that 6 of the 7 treated patients were alive after 10 years, whereas all 11 patients who were treated with a placebo died within the same 10 year time frame. The Peer-Reviewed Publication stated that the Phase II Trial achieved the primary safety endpoint. However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm such results.

The Company decided to pursue the further development of AE37 in combination with the newly approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are drugs that enable the body’s immune system to detect tumors, that the immune system would not otherwise be able to detect. The Company believes that by combining AE37 with checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda, AE37 can theoretically direct the immune system to attack target tumors and therefore can be tested in the initial stage of cancer treatment instead of being tested as a vaccine against recurrence of cancer, which requires extensive wait times in Phase II trials to determine whether or not cancer has reoccurred. The Company believes that this strategy should decrease the length of time for its Phase II trials of AE37, however there can be no assurance that using this strategy will result in shorter lengths of time for AE37 Phase II clinicals.
 Based on the preliminary results from the Phase II Trial, NGIO entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) on June 28, 2017 with Merck Sharpe & Dohme B.V. (“Merck”) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AE37 in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy, pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Since then, the Company has initiated the study at 5 clinical research sites, and completed the first 3-patient safety cohort to allow for expanded enrollment. The Phase II trial began enrolling patients in September of 2019, and is expected to enroll 29 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic temporarily paused enrollment for the first half of the year, however, patient screening has restarted and enrollment is continuing. The Collaboration Agreement provides for NGIO to sponsor the study and to make the regulatory filings for approval of the trial. Merck will supply NGIO with Keytruda® for the trial. NGIO will provide its AE37 cancer vaccine and will generally be responsible for the costs of the trial. All Clinical Data shall be jointly owned by NGIO and Merck. Merck and NGIO assigned to each other an undivided one-half interest in, to and under the Clinical Data. The trial will require additional funding estimated at roughly $1.5 million over the next three years. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, on November 20, 2018, NGIO entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement (the “Clinical Trial Agreement”) with NSABP Foundation, Inc. (“NSABP”), which provides for NSABP conducting a Phase II clinical trial on the safety and efficacy of AE37 in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as described above, which NGIO will sponsor. NGIO has also signed a Pharmacovigilance Agreement among Merck, NSABP and NGIO to ensure the clinical monitoring of the trial.
 The Phase II clinical trial conducted pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement and the Clinical Trial Agreement will have a Simon two-stage design. In Stage I (safety cohort), 13 patients will receive combination therapy of AE37 vaccine (without granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor GM-CSF adjuvant) 1000 micrograms in two split intradermal injections on Day 1 of cycles 1 through 5 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous infusion (IV) given Day 1 of each cycle for 2 years (1 cycle equals 21 days). As the clinical trial continues, NGIO will be obligated to pay NSABP, pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, additional amounts during each completed phase in the increments and at the times set forth in the agreement in four primary phases: Start-Up Activities, Accrual and Treatment Period, Follow-up Period and Primary Endpoint. The future payments required under the Clinical Trial Agreement will be funded through financings and the proceeds received from a licensing agreement with Shenzhen described below.  All Clinical Data shall be jointly owned by NGIO and Merck.
 The Collaboration Agreement terminates after the completion of the related Phase II clinical trial. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by any party for material breaches of the agreement by the other party, patient safety concerns, regulatory reasons or by Merck if it believes KEYTRUDA is being used in an unsafe manner.
 The Clinical Trial Agreement terminates upon the completion of the obligations under such agreement. The Clinical Trial Agreement may be terminated by (i) any party if the authorization to conduct the Phase II clinical trial is revoked by the FDA; if the human and/or toxicology results support termination; safety concerns, if the manufacture of a drug used in the Phase II clinical trial has been exhausted or (ii) by NSABP if we fail to pay NSABP an undisputed amount under the Clinical Trial Agreement.

In addition to the breast cancer program, NGIO completed a Phase I clinical trial of AE37 in combination with GM-CSF in prostate cancer in April of 2009. This Phase I trial commenced in November of 2007 and enrolled thirty-two HER-2/neu+, castrate-sensitive, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients to demonstrate safety and strong immunological response to AE37. The trial was administered by Dr. Sonya Perez, MD and Dr. Anastastios Thanos, MD, PhD at the Saint Savas Cancer Hospital in Athens, Greece (EudraCT 2007-000934-38). Both the primary endpoint of safety and the secondary endpoint of immunogenicity were achieved. There were no serious adverse events. We are advancing AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer through a License and Research Agreement (the “License Agreement”) dated November 29, 2017 with Shenzhen. Under the License Agreement, NGIO granted Shenzhen an exclusive license (the “License”) to use NGIO’s patents, know-how, data and other intellectual property relating to NGIO’s AE37 peptide to develop and sell products for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer in China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau). In exchange for exclusive rights to AE37 for prostate cancer in China, Shenzen is financing and conducting the Phase II and Phase III trials globally under International Commission on Harmonization (“ICH”) guidelines, with us retaining the rights to all clinical data for regulatory submissions and commercialization in the rest of the world outside China. Further, Shenzhen has agreed, inter alia, to the following financial consideration:
 
• | a $700,000 non-refundable initial payment;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | milestone payments of $1,000,000 each upon completion of Phase II and Phase III studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a milestone payment of $2,000,000 upon regulatory approval of a product covered by the License; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a 10% royalty on net sales, provided the patents are in force and there are no approved generic equivalents.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | royalties can be reduced to a floor of 4.0% in certain circumstances if the licensed patents do not cover a licensed product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Shenzhen, generally, will be responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing Chinese regulatory approvals, and marketing in China for all products developed under the License Agreement.
 In exchange for exclusive rights to AE37 for prostate cancer in China, Shenzen is financing and conducting the Phase II trials in China, Hong Kong, Australia, and the European Union and Phase III trials globally under ICH guidelines, with NGIO retaining the rights to all clinical data for regulatory submissions and commercialization in the rest of the world outside China. If Shenzhen is successful in completing positive results in the prostate cancer development program, we will evaluate the data and make determinations on a commercialization strategy.
 The License Agreement terminates upon the later to occur of (x) the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent under the License Agreement and (y) the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the first approved sale of a licensed product by Shenzhen in China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau). The License Agreement may also be terminated (i) by any party to the agreement generally upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party or if the other party materially breaches the License Agreement or (ii) by Shenzhen any time after eighteen (18) months from the License Agreement’s effective date upon sixty (60) days’ notice to NGIO. Unless Shenzhen terminates the License Agreement pursuant to clause (y)(ii) above, or we terminate the agreement pursuant to clause (y)(i) above, Shenzhen may sell any licensed products existing at the time of termination for twelve (12) months after such termination. No other royalties shall be payable after the termination of the License Agreement other than royalties that have accrued and are unpaid as of the date of termination. 
 In regard to commercialization of AE37 in cancer there are typically over 20 science based valuation points based on critical significant positive data. At each of these points NGIO can either raise the capital to proceed with the development on its own or enter into a partnership with a a Major pharmaceutical company like Merck that have checkpoint inhibitors. There are currently six pharmaceutical companies with approved checkpoint inhibitor products on the market. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve any valuation points or that we can raise capital or partner with a major pharmaceutical company to continue develop AE 37 for cancer treatment. It is expected that FDA approval will take from 5 to 7 years, provided the funding is available to complete Phase III registration trials and the filing of a New Drug Application (“NDA”).

We plan to continue the development of AE37 for breast, prostate and other cancers including bladder cancer. Upon funding we plan to initiate a Phase II trial of AE37 in bladder cancer at a premier cancer institute. Discussions on confidential trial design and conduct are ongoing.
 In addition to the AE37 clinical program in cancer, NGIO has conducted a Phase I clinical trial of an Ii-Key-H5N1 peptide vaccine for avian influenza. The trial was conducted by Dr. Alexander Abdelnoor, MD in 2007 and 2008 in Lebanon at the Lebanese Canadian Hospital, enrolling 120 subjects who were randomized to receive intramuscularly 500 micrograms of Ii-Key peptide vaccine or placebo. Ten Ii-Key-H5N1 epitope peptides were tested for safety and immunogenicity (10 subjects per cohort). The trial demonstrated the safety and measured T-Cell responses to the Ii-Key peptides. After the Phase I trial was completed, however, interest in the avian influenza vaccine waned because the virus disappeared before becoming a serious global pandemic. The pandemic flu research program was discontinued following the swine flu scare, which faded into the background ten years ago. 
 To address the current COVID-19 pandemic, Generex and NGIO have resurrected the pandemic research program using its proprietary, patented Ii-Key immune system activation technology that holds promise for the rapid development of a complete SARS-COV-2 Ii-Key peptide vaccine. The plan includes the conduct of a master protocol design that includes a Phase I/II dose escalation trial, with and without adjuvant, followed by a Phase III trial using the target commercial dose and formulation. This master protocol design will be conducted with healthy adult volunteers followed by cohorts in different age and risk categories. The commercial development program is budgeted for roughly $400 million, including manufacturing and scale-up, and it is estimated that it will take 12 to 18 months for completion, depending on FDA emergency regulatory decisions during the pandemic. To accomplish these goals, Generex and NGIO have partnered with globally recognized industry leaders for each of the program’s key activities, to ensure world-class science, strategy and execution. Our objective is to provide government funding agencies with every degree of confidence in the ability of our team to execute and mitigate program risks. Generex has made applications to BARDA in the U.S. and with Health Canada and Malaysian health authorities to support the clinical and commercial development program for NGIO’s SARS-COV-2 Ii-Key peptide vaccine.
  There is always uncertainty and risk associated with the development of any vaccine, medical treatment or therapy, but the continued development depends upon completing the trials under various collaboration agreements and associated potential commercialization of the product, FDA approval and/or licensing agreements. Any collaborator with whom we may enter into such collaboration agreements may not support fully our research and commercial interests since our program may compete for time, attention and resources with such collaborator's internal programs. Therefore, these collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our program to move it forward effectively, or that the program will advance as rapidly as it might if we had retained complete control of all research, development, regulatory and commercialization decisions. During the pandemic COVID-19, it is anticipated that delays will occur, but the full impact of any slow down due to COVID-19 has not been determined.
 According to a published report in the Journal of Health Economics from Tufts University for the Study of Drug Development, developing a new prescription medicine that gains marketing approval is estimated to cost drug makers $1.4 billion in out of pocket costs. Furthermore, the estimated cost of post-approval research and development is $312 million. Research and development costs include studies to test new indications, new formulations, new dosage strength and regimens, and to monitor safety and long-term side effects in patients as required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 Given this market environment, and the early stage of development for our Ii-Key immunotherapeutic peptide vaccines, we are focused on developing our product candidates through Phase II proof of concept trials, with the expectation that positive Phase II data will lead to a partnership or joint venture agreement with a major pharmaceutical company that is positioned, financially, operationally, and commercially to bring a drug through the regulatory process and into the market with a successful drug launch. To that end, we do not currently plan to bring the products to market, but rather pursue a partnership opportunity with development milestones, licensing fees, and royalties, as is common throughout the biotechnology industry. Each product candidate will require between $15 and $50 million to complete the clinical development and manufacturing process that will be needed to obtain such partnerships and we cannot predict when, if at all, we will obtain such funding and even if such funding is obtained we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into the partnerships or joint ventures discussed above.

The primary research and development costs incurred by NGIO during the year ending July 31, 2020 were $477,319 related to the costs for the Clinical Trial Agreement and activities of the Study being conducted by NASBP.
 Clinical Development Plans for Ii-Key Immunotherapeutic Peptides
 NGIO plans to expand its clinical development program to evaluate AE37 immunotherapeutic peptide in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of bladder cancer in cooperation with a major oncology research center focused on the role of HER-2/neu in bladder and urothelial cancer. The clinical & translational research program is designed to evaluate the ability of AE37 to activate a CD-4 response in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor and the effect of the combination therapy on the tumor microenvironment.
 Additionally, NGIO is working with another major oncology research center to rebuild the company’s long-dormant melanoma program, which includes Ii-Key hybrid peptides for GP-100 and Tyrosinase (TYR). We are working with a long-term clinical advisor at the research institute to establish a translational research program that incorporates gene expression profiling, tumor microenvironment immunology, and clinical biomarker evaluation, coordinating with their newly established immuno-oncology clinical research center.
 Intellectual Property
 Platform Patents. The foundational “Platform Patents” for Ii-Key technology focus on methods of increasing the antigen-specific activation of CD4+ T cells. This cell type is a critical component of the immune system, involved both in the recognition of new pathogenic agents as well as in autoimmune syndromes. The first technology platform (Ii-Key Hybrid) relates to a means for increasing the vaccine potency of virtually any protein and while the second (Ii-suppression) relates to generation of an effective cell-based vaccine (REH-2017-01, REH 2017-02).
 Oncology Patents. This group of patents relate more specifically to the use of the platform technologies for generating anti-cancer vaccines. We have generated Ii-Key Hybrid compounds specifically for patients with breast, prostate, bladder, melanoma and HPV-related cancers (AEX-2001, AEX-2006, AEX-2007).
 We hold five U.S. patents and one patent in Japan. The U.S. patent numbers are 7,935,350 (expiring November 3, 2022), 8,748,130 (expiring on December 10, 2025), 8,889,143 (expiring on May 18, 2026), 9,289,487 (expiring on September 22, 2027), 8,815,249 (expiring on February 26, 2026). Japan patent number is 5,707,326 (expiring September 1, 2029). These patents cover:
 
• | Compositions and Methods Related to Ii Technology
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Ii hybrid peptides used for the enhancement of antigen presentation
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Constructs for the expression of Ii-Key/antigen epitope fusion peptides
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hybrid Ii-Key/antigen epitope fusion peptides
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Methods for inhibiting Ii expression
--+-------------------------------------


We also have U.S. patents on the Ii-Key technology that have expired, we are in discussions with third parties to extend the patent coverage of the Ii-Key technology for cancer immunotherapy. The expiration dates of the immune-oncology applications of the Ii-Key hybrid technologies extend to 2031. The company is exploring the development of new immunotherapeutic peptide vaccines against additional tumor antigens, and plans to use computer algorithms to identify epitopes of tumor antigens that can be linked to the Ii-Key to develop new IP and products based on the Ii-Key platform technology.

Our long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.
  We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators.
 The US Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) compensates patentees with additional patent in-force days if there are delays by the US PTO during prosecution. These additional days are called patent term adjustment (“PTA”) days and they allow a patentee to keep its patent in force after the expiration date of the patent for a period of time that the US PTO has provided as PTA.
 In addition to patent protection, we plan to seek marketing exclusivity under other laws and regulations. Our success for preserving market exclusivity for our product candidate relies on our ability to obtain and maintain a regulatory period of data exclusivity for an approved biologic, currently 12 years from the date of marketing approval, obtaining orphan designation in the major markets and to preserve effective patent coverage. Once any regulatory period of data exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing and selling biosimilar versions of our product candidates. We are also dependent upon the diligence of third parties, which control the prosecution of pending domestic and foreign patent applications and maintain granted domestic and foreign patents.
 We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business.

 Our products and services are not subject to seasonality.
 Competition
 The major pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb (and acquisition Celgene), Merck, Sanofi, and Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, MedImmune Inc. (a subsidiary of Astra-Zeneca, Inc.) and others, also compete in the oncology, immunomedicine and vaccine markets. These companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, as well as manufacturing and marketing approved products. As such, they are also considered significant competitors in these fields of pharmaceutical products and therapies. There are also many smaller companies which are pursuing similar technologies in these fields and are considered to be our competitors. With significant research and development effort in the field, the cancer immunotherapy market has been forecasted to be $128.3 billion[1], $152.829 billion[2] and $173 billion[3] by the mid-2020’s.
 While the size of the future market remains unknown, what is certain is that immuno-oncology is growing, and that its lead products enjoy blockbuster ($1 billion-plus/year in sales) status several times over. According to Genetic Engineering News (February 25, 2019), the biggest-selling cancer immunotherapies in 2018 were Celgene’s Revlimid (lenalidomide), which generated $9.685 billion; Opdivo® (nivolumab), which generated $7.570 billion, Merck’s Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), which generated $7.171 billion, Bristol-Myers Squibb, which generated $6.735 billion and Ono Pharmaceutical, which generated $835 million.
 There are a limited number of commercialized products in the immunotherapy field, but that has not deterred the investment community, which recognizes the huge potential for cancer immunotherapy, and supplies hundreds of millions of dollars in development funding annually. According to the Cancer Research Institute, there are 3,394 immuno-oncology therapies in the current global development pipeline, with 1,287 of them in clinical studies. The major pharmaceutical companies have significant research and development efforts in the immuno-oncology field. NGIO has never received regulatory approval for a product candidate or had commercial sales.
 As described in “Business Overview” above where we discuss certain clinical trials, NGIO has years of experience in cancer immunotherapy, having completed a Phase II clinical trial of the HER2/neu Ii-Key hybrid peptide vaccine AE37 for the prevention of breast cancer recurrence in over 300 women. The company has also conducted Phase I trials with AE37 in breast and prostate cancers and has conducted pre-clinical work to support additional peptide vaccines for the treatment of melanoma.
 NGIO has a research agreement with Merck and is conducting a Phase II clinical trial of AE37 in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer, a multi-billion market with significant medical need.
 NGIO has licensed AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer in China to Shenzhen Bioscien, a Chinese Pharmaceutical company. As part of the licensing agreement, Shezhen Bioscien is paying for the development of the immunotherapeutic vaccine and conducting the clinical trials under ICH guidelines in Europe as well as in China. NGIO retains global rights to AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer outside of China and has exclusive rights to the clinical trial data to support regulatory filings in the US, EU, Japan, and other ex-China markets.
 With a late phase clinical asset, a research partnership with a major pharmaceutical company, a licensing deal with an international pharmaceutical company, and a pipeline of immunotherapeutic products, NGIO is positioned to become a participant in the immuno-oncology field.

Employees
 As of the date of this registration statement, we had six full time employees, including Joseph Moscato, Chief Executive Officer; Eric von Hofe, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Mark Corrao, Interim Chief Financial Officer; Jason B. Terell, Chief Medical Officer; Richard Purcell, Executive Vice President of R&D and Anthony Crisci, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary. In the future, we plan to hire additional employees, including a Financial Controller and support staff. In the meantime, we plan to continue utilizing key consultants and contractors for certain operations, such as finance and accounting, business development, clinical development, regulatory affairs, statistical consulting, and manufacturing. We believe our relationships with our employees and contractors are good.
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our medical device, biologic, and pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in Europe, and comparable designated regulatory authorities in other countries. Among other things, extensive regulations require us to satisfy numerous conditions before we can bring products to market. While these regulations apply to all competitors in our industry, having a technology that is unique and novel extends the requisite review period by the various divisions within the FDA and other regulators. Also, other companies in our industry are not limited primarily to products which still need to be approved by government regulators, as we are now.
 If requisite regulatory approvals are not obtained and maintained, our business will be substantially harmed. In many cases, we expect that extant and prospective development partners will participate in the regulatory approval process. The following discussion summarizes the principal features of food and drug regulation in the United States and other countries as they affect our business.
 United States. All aspects of our research, development and foreseeable commercial activities relating to medical device, biologic, and pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. United States federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The regulatory approval process, including clinical trials, usually takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed.
 The steps required before a medical device, biologic or pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include:
 
• | Conducting appropriate pre-clinical laboratory evaluations, including animal studies, in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) requirements, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation and stability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the FDA, along with manufacturing information, analytical data, and protocols for clinical studies, in an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, and receiving approval from the FDA that the clinical studies proposed under the IND are allowed to proceed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) to administer the product to humans in clinical studies; conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in compliance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quality and pre-clinical tests and studies include: laboratory evaluation of drug substance and drug product chemistry, formulation/manufacturing, and stability profiling, as well as a large number of animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product. 
 The results of the quality and pre-clinical tests/studies, in addition to any non-clinical pharmacology, are submitted to the FDA along with the initial clinical study protocol (see descriptive of process below) as part of the initial IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to it, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA reviews all protocols, protocol amendments, adverse event reports, study reports, and annual reports in connection with a new pharmacological product.
 The IND for the Phase I clinical trial for breast cancer was filed and became effective in 2006 (IND #12229), and the Phase II Trial was conducted under the same IND. The original IND was sponsored by Dr. George Peoples, and the IND was subsequently transferred to NGIO on June 1, 2010. The Company has no current relationship with Dr. Peoples.
 The IND for the Phase II trial of AE37 in combination with pembrolizumab (Merck’s Keytruda®) for treatment of triple negative breast cancer became effective in December 2018, and the trial is expected to continue enrolling patients through 2020. NSABP filed the IND on our behalf for this trial.
 The Phase I clinical trial for prostate cancer conducted in 2007 took place in the European Union as described under “—Foreign Countries” below.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of a new drug to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators. The protocols for the trials must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Also, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB, which considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III), but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials test the drug on healthy human subjects for safety and other aspects, but usually not effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the drug for specific purposes, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosages, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. When a compound has shown evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety in Phase II evaluations, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate and confirm clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at clinical trial sites in different geographical locations. The FDA and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of therapeutic product candidates be supported through at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials (known as “Pivotal Trials”). The successful completion of Phase III clinical trials is a mandatory step in the approval process for the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of products.
 In the United States, the results of quality, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to the FDA in an NDA to seek approval to market and commercialize the drug product for a specified use. The NDA is far more specific than the IND and must also include proposed labeling and detailed technical sections based on the data collected. The FDA is governed by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) regarding response time to the application, which is generally 12 months (and shorter for a priority application). It may deny a NDA if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA also may require additional clarifications on the existing application or even additional testing for safety and efficacy of the drug. We cannot be sure that any of our proposed products will receive FDA approval. The multi-tiered approval process means that our products could fail to advance to subsequent steps without the requisite data, studies, and FDA approval along the way. Even if approved by the FDA, our products and the facilities used to manufacture our products will remain subject to review and periodic inspection by the FDA.
 To supply drug products for use in the United States, foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Manufacturing facilities must also comply with the FDA’s cGMPs, and such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. Products manufactured outside the United States are inspected by regulatory authorities in those countries under agreements with the FDA.  To comply with cGMPs, manufacturers must expend substantial funds, time and effort in the area of production and quality control. The FDA stringently applies its regulatory standards for manufacturing. Discovery of previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility may result in consequences with commercial significance. These include restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawals of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.

One final hurdle that is closely associated with the cGMP inspections is the pre-approval inspection that the FDA carries out prior to the issuance of a marketing license. FDA inspectors combine cGMP compliance with a review of research and development documents that were used in the formal NDA. A close inspection of historic data is reviewed to confirm data and to demonstrate that a company has carried out the activities as presented in the NDA. This is generally a long inspection and requires a team of individuals from the Company to “host” the FDA inspector(s).
 Foreign Countries
 Before we are permitted to market any of our products outside of the United States, those products will be subject to regulatory approval by foreign government agencies similar to the FDA. These requirements vary widely from country to country. Generally, however, no action can be taken to market any drug product in a country until an appropriate application has been submitted by a sponsor and approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. Again, similar to the FDA, each country will mandate a specific financial consideration for the Marketing Application dossiers being submitted. Although an important consideration, FDA approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. The Canadian regulatory process is substantially similar to that of the United States. To date, we have received a number of foreign regulatory approvals for our product candidates, as listed below, however we are not manufacturing, marketing, nor distributing products in these regions based upon these approvals. There are no current plans to pursue these markets with these products, as we have redirected its efforts to more profitable business opportunities.

Environmental Compliance 
 Our research and development activities have involved the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with all applicable government regulations. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurred, we could be held liable for damages, and these damages could severely impact our financial condition. We are also subject to many environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, particularly those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of hazardous biological materials. Violations and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us. However, we do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental laws will have a material effect on us in the foreseeable future.
Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us.
 Property
 The address of our principal executive offices is10102 USA Today Way, Suite 200 Miramar, FL 33025 using space which we share with Generex, our parent. We do not currently own any real estate.
