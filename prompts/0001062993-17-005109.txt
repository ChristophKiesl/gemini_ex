 OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 Destiny develops and markets software as a service (SaaS) solutions that solve critical problems in distribution and promotion for businesses in the music industry. of digital media content over the Internet. Destiny services are based around proprietary security, watermarking and instant play streaming media technologies. 
 The core of the business is the Play MPE® promotional music marketing and digital distribution service. Play MPE® is a service for promoting and securely distributing broadcast quality audio, video, images, promotional information and other digital content securely through the internet. The system is currently used by the recording industry for transferring pre-release broadcast quality music, radio shows, and music videos to trusted recipients such as radio stations, media reviewers, VIPs, DJs, film and TV personnel, sports stadiums and retailers. The system replaces the physical distribution (mail, courier or hand delivery) of CDs. 
 Record labels around the world, including all three major labels (Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment), are regularly using Play MPE® to deliver their content to radio. 
 Play MPE® is a cloud-based enterprise SaaS service providing tiered, permission based, access allowing our clients to assign varying rights, capabilities and responsibilities to different members of their staff. For example, some customer staff may manage assets (album cover imagery, music videos, the raw music, promotional information and other metadata), while others manage hierarchical permission based lists of recipients. Larger labels are normally structured into label groups, each with their own labels with varying access (permissions) to various subsets of the master recipient lists. 
 The release dates for music can be dependent on the territory and, where administrative settings permit, local promotions staff may generate a localized distribution of the song with modified marketing information in the local language. Local staff may select pre-existing assets from the system and combine them together with a local recipient lists to form a send. Our customers also choose the level of access for the recipients assigned to the release by designating whether the release can be streamed, downloaded, exported into an unlocked digital format or burned to a CD. 
 While many clients are set up to manage and upload recipient lists, many rely on the proprietary lists provided within the service. Our staff manages lists of recipients in various formats and geographies and those lists are made available to our customers using the Play MPE® system. The Play MPE® system provides Play MPE® staff with the feedback and resources necessary to manage and maintain this network of recipients which is not available with physical distribution or by smaller competitors. Customers select lists of recipients within the proprietary network based on music format and geography.

When the release is sent, the send appears in the available tracks section of a recipients account. Recipients can access these tracks through proprietary iPhone, Mac and Windows based players, or through partner sites. In 2016 we made it even easier for decision makers in radio, press, TV, and film to use the Play MPE® service with a new secure streaming audio preview feature. The enhancement allows Play MPE® recipients to quickly hear a short preview of a song directly from the notification email without having to login. 
 Destiny's servers also generate a marketing website (http://daily.plaympe.com) which promotes new music. The system automatically generates charts of the most popular music on the system. These charts can be syndicated to third parties. 
 All exported songs are marked in real time with Destinys watermark technology, which has received three US patents and a number of analogous patents globally. Songs that appear on the internet are scanned by the 
 International Federation of the Phonographic Industrys (IFPI) for our watermark. Headquartered in London, UK, the IFPI is the organization that represents the interests of the recording industry worldwide and one of its missions is to safeguard the rights of record producers. IFPI web crawlers visit torrents, peer to peer networks and websites searching for unauthorized content. When problem files are identified, the IFPI software looks for Destinys watermark in the content to identify the originating source. 
 After the content is released, all activity by the recipient is logged in real time, providing record labels and promotions staff real time detail on which songs are accessed, streamed, downloaded and exported. This contrast with physical distribution where record labels may be unsure whether the courier package went to the correct individual or whether it was ever opened. This information provides invaluable feedback in real time to marketing and promotions staff who can cater their programs appropriately. Recipients receive a custom library of available tracks and are able to repeat the download if music is lost. 
 Real time usage statistics for Play MPE® are available at: http://www.dsny.com/play-mpe-stats 
 Ongoing work in 2017 progressed on a completely browser based encoder, when all stages are complete, this system will be accessible on any computer without installation and will completely replace many of the current Windows based desktop tools. It is expected that this new solution will increase usage of Play MPE® by providing an easier to use, more intuitive experience, providing access to both Mac and PC users, providing new release creation workflows, and more configuration options. It also allows for easy translation to accelerate international expansion. 
 We continue to invest in new development which should lead to higher usage. 
 The Company also has a legacy business, Clipstream®, in the online video industry for which it is pursuing strategic alternatives. The Clipstream® Online Video Platform (OVP) is a self-service system, for encoding, hosting and reporting on video playback which can be embedded in third party websites or emails. Playback is currently through the Companys proprietary JavaScript codec engine, which is only available on the internet through the Company. 
 The unique software based approach to rendering video, is protected by over two dozen patents claiming initial priority to 2011. This product is marketed in a limited way and has incidental revenues. 
 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
 Play MPE® 
 During the year ended August 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $3,445,014, of which 99% was derived from Play MPE®. 
 In September 2016, we announced the availability of a new secure streaming audio preview feature. 
 This enhancement allows Play MPE® recipients to quickly hear a short preview of a song directly from the notification email without having to login. This quick audio preview leverages Play MPE®s secure infrastructure and patented watermarking features to increase recipient activity and engagement with the service. This increased activity and engagement within the system increases the value of each Play MPE® release and further solidifies Play MPE® as the go-to-service for promotional music distribution.

Throughout the year the Play MPE service was regularly updated, these updates included a significant upgrade to the email sending infrastructure and a number of smaller features targeted at improved performance and increasing activity. Progress also continued on additional services for a new generation of browser based administration tools that are planned to launch in 2018. These new tools are expected to increase usage with existing customers and facilitate expansion to new customers, radio formats, and territories. 
 Play MPE® staff regularly attend various industry conferences including: 
 
September 2016 | Americanafest, Nashivlle, TN 
---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 2016 | Christian Music Broadcasters Momentum 2016, Lake Buena Vista, FL 
February 2017 | Country Radio Seminar, Nashville, TN 
April 2017 | Canadian Music Week, Toronto, ON 
May 2017 | Non Commvention, Philadelphia, PA 
June 2017 | The Gathering, Louisville, KY 
August 2017 | FMQB Triple A Convention, Boulder, CO 

 Other business development efforts focused on moving select customers to monthly subscription pricing that encourages more usage of the system. Initial trial customers have significantly increased their spending and activity with Play MPE as a result of moving to a simpler monthly pricing model, additional customers have been identified for transition to monthly pricing. 
 Clipstream® 
 The Clipstream script based video engine received on-going updates throughout the year focused on improving quality and user experience across a broad range of devices. In July of 2017 the business development strategy was revised to focus only on partnerships where the differentiated value of script based video could offer stronger differentiation to customers performing other workflows in online video. 
 In November 2017, after completing a detailed review of the resources required to progress Clipstream further, the Company transitioned the product to maintenance only stopping development of new major features. Business development will focus on identifying strategic alternatives for the product, business, and intellectual property outside the Company. 
 Significant Customers 
 During the year ended August 31, 2017, we generated 41% of total revenue from one customer (2016 - one customer represented 42%). 
 OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
 We lease approximately 6,550 square feet of office space, with the lease expiring in June of 2022, and we currently have 22 total employees. Our employees include our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, two finance personnel, ten sales and technical support personnel, and nine software developers. We also employ contractors as needed. 
Research and Development 
 Total research and development expenditures for the year ended August 31, 2017 were $1,304,742 (2016: $1,292,996).

COMPETITION 
 Play MPE® 
 Play MPE® has regional competitors with limited global presence and limited functionality while Play MPE® has major label use globally. A network effect entrenches the system, as it is difficult for any single user to switch to an alternative without the entire industry switching. The system was built to facilitate sharing of assets and content with regional subsidiaries and affiliates of our major label customers. This allows local representatives to localize the release resulting in costs savings and efficiencies not available in competing solutions. The player software is available in 27 languages. 
 Play MPE® has several advantages over physical distribution (mail, courier or hand delivery) of manufactured CDs. Digital distribution through Play MPE® is faster, less expensive, more reliable, more secure, provides additional real time and more accurate reporting of usage, provides a great deal of added functionality and provides the error free and automatic transmission of metadata. Metadata includes International Standard Recording Codes (ISRC)  which is a standard code for uniquely identifying sound recordings and music video recordings - song and artist names, beats per minute, release and impact dates, etc. The automatic transmission of this metadata reduces the time required for manual data entry into radio automation software on the receiving side and eliminates inaccuracies in royalty reporting. This benefits labels who want to be in third party databases as the transmission of this data is immediate and reliable. 
 The Play MPE® system provides our clients with a sophisticated content management tool that includes privilege control, release sharing amongst global territories (saving our clients time and money when conducting global distributions), enhanced email notification and promotions tools, social media announcements, recipient player apps (iPhone, iPad, Android, Android Tablet and Blackberry), with a fully redundant high speed infrastructure that is more sophisticated and has higher functionality than quickly developed lower cost alternatives. The Company expects that competition will be strongest where audio quality, security, recipient network, and reporting are not as important as cost. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 We are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses. It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in both the United States and Canada with particular applicability to the Internet. Governments have and may continue to enact legislation applicable to us in areas such as content distribution, performance and copying, other copyright issues, network security, encryption, the use of key escrow data, privacy protection, caching of content by server products, electronic authentication or digital signatures, illegal or obscene content, access charges and retransmission activities. The applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, content, taxation, defamation and personal privacy is also uncertain. Export or import restrictions, new legislation or regulation or governmental enforcement of existing regulations may limit the growth of the Internet, increase our costs of doing business or increase its legal exposure. 
 The Company owns proprietary algorithms, source code, web domain addresses, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. 
 Patents 
 
1. | Digital Locking "Digital Media Distribution Method and System" (US Patent No. 7466823) 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This patent provides a method of locking digital content which prevents play back on unauthorized machines and devices. Claims include separating security from the content, so that content files can be shared securely over peer to peer networks. This is one of the earliest patents for securing peer to peer distributed content. 
 One of the more important claims in this patent is the ability to uniquely recognize a particular computer. Uniquely identifying a persons computer is a common issue which is usually approached by saving cookies or beacons to the users computer or by tracking IP addresses. These are not reliable solutions as cookies are easily deleted and IP addresses easily changed. Destinys propriety hash code process creates a serial number that can be used to recognize the user on subsequent visits without ever saving anything to that users computer.

 We have a developed a watermarking technology which can uniquely identify the individual who originally accessed a particular song. Our watermark is unique as it can be embedded and identified rapidly, it is inaudible, it survives on air broadcast, compression and conversion to other formats and is virtually impossible to remove. Our watermarking technology is used in the Play MPE® distribution system when songs are exported or when streaming a track. Other watermarking technologies are slow and provide a trade-off between a destruction of audio quality and the ease that they can be filtered out. When the original patent claims were granted in the US, the Company filed a set of new additional, broader claims in a continuation application in Canada and the US to further protect the technology.
