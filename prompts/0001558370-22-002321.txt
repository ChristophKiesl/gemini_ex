US Ecology is a leading provider of environmental services to commercial and governmental entities. The Company addresses the complex waste management and response needs of its customers, offering treatment, disposal and recycling of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste, leading emergency response and standby services, and a wide range of complementary field services. US Ecology’s focus on safety, environmental compliance and best-in-class customer service enables us to effectively meet the needs of our customers and to build long-lasting relationships. US Ecology and its predecessor companies have been in business for more than 65 years. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,600 people.
Predecessor US Ecology was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in March 1987 as American Ecology Corporation. On February 22, 2010, Predecessor US Ecology changed its name from American Ecology Corporation to US Ecology, Inc. On November 1, 2019, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of NRC (the “NRC Merger”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 23, 2019 (the “NRC Merger Agreement”), by and among the 

4



Company, NRC, Predecessor US Ecology, Rooster Merger Sub, Inc. and ECOL Merger Sub, Inc., a new parent entity of US Ecology completed a merger transaction with Predecessor US Ecology, became the successor to Predecessor US Ecology and changed its name to “US Ecology, Inc.” In connection with the closing of the NRC Merger, Predecessor US Ecology changed its name to “US Ecology Holdings, Inc.,” and remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Ecology. Our filings with the SEC are posted on our website at www.usecology.com or can be obtained by accessing the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
We have a network of fixed facilities and service centers operating primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. Our fixed facilities include five RCRA subtitle C hazardous waste landfills, three landfills serving waste streams regulated by the RRC and one LLRW landfill. We also have various other TSDF facilities located throughout the United States. These facilities generate revenue from fees charged to transport, recycle, treat and dispose of waste and to perform various field services for our customers.
Effective in the fourth quarter of 2020, we made changes to the manner in which we manage our business, make operating decisions and assess our performance. The energy waste business that was acquired through the NRC Merger now comprises our Energy Waste segment. Prior to this change, the energy waste business was included in the Waste Solutions segment (formerly “Environmental Services”). Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all periods presented have been recast to reflect these changes. Under our new structure our operations are managed in three reportable segments reflecting our internal management reporting structure and nature of services offered as follows:
Waste Solutions (formerly “Environmental Services”)—This segment provides safe and compliant specialty waste management services including treatment, disposal, beneficial re-use, and recycling of hazardous, non-hazardous, and other specialty waste at Company-owned treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, excluding the services within our Energy Waste segment.
Field Services (formerly “Field & Industrial Services”)—This segment provides safe and compliant logistics and response solutions focusing on “in-field’ service offerings through our network of 10-day transfer facilities. Our logistics solutions include specialty waste packaging, collection, transportation, and total waste management. Our response solutions include land and marine based emergency response, OSRO standby compliance, remediation, and industrial services. The Field Services segment completes our vertically integrated model and serves to increase waste volumes into our Waste Solutions segment.
Energy Waste—This segment provides safe and compliant energy waste management and critical support services to up-stream oil and gas customers in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins primarily operating in Texas. Services include spill containment and site remediation, equipment cleaning and maintenance services, specialty equipment rental, including tanks, pumps and containment, safety monitoring and management and transportation and disposal. This segment includes all of the energy waste business of the legacy NRC operations and none of the legacy US Ecology operations.

Effective in the first quarter of 2021, we changed our management structure resulting in the reclassification of certain overhead expenses from our Waste Solutions, Field Services and Energy Waste reportable segments to Corporate. As a result, certain regional overhead costs historically presented within our reportable segments as Direct operating costs were further reclassified to Corporate as Selling, general and administrative expenses to conform to the current period’s presentation. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all periods presented have been recast to reflect these changes.
Waste Solutions Segment
Our Waste Solutions involve the transportation, treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive wastes, and include physical treatment, recycling, landfill and deep-well injection disposal and wastewater treatment services.

5



Waste Treatment & Disposal
We recycle, treat and dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous industrial wastes. The wastes handled include substances which are classified as “hazardous” because of their corrosive, ignitable, reactive or toxic properties, and other wastes subject to federal, state and provincial environmental regulation. The wastes we handle come in solid, liquid and sludge form and can be received in a variety of containerized and bulk forms and transported to our facilities by truck and rail.
We operate five permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities with landfills in Beatty, Nevada; Robstown, Texas; Grand View, Idaho; Belleville, Michigan and Blainville, Québec, Canada. These facilities are used primarily for the disposal of wastes treated at Company-owned onsite and offsite treatment facilities. The United States landfills are regulated under RCRA by the respective states in which they are located and the USEPA. Our onsite treatment facilities specialize in the treatment and disposal of RCRA, TSCA, PCB remediation and certain USNRC-exempt (NORM/NARM, Technologically Enhanced NORM (TENORM)) radioactive waste. Our Canadian landfill is regulated by the Québec Ministry of Environment and authorized under the QEQA to treat and stabilize inorganic hazardous liquid and solid waste and contaminated soils to produce a non-leachable concrete-like material for disposal in the onsite landfill, specializing in processing hard to treat materials, such as cyanides, mercury compounds, strong acids, non-organic oxidizers, lab packs, contaminated debris and batteries.
We operate a commercial LLRW landfill in Richland, Washington that is licensed by the Washington Department of Health through delegated authority of the USNRC. The WUTC sets disposal rates for LLRW. Rates are set at an amount sufficient to cover operating costs and provide us with a reasonable profit. The current rate agreement with the WUTC was extended in 2019 and is effective until December 31, 2025.
As of December 31, 2021, the capacity used in the calculation of the useful economic lives of our six Waste Solutions landfills includes approximately 45.1 million cubic yards of remaining permitted airspace capacity and approximately 18.1 million cubic yards of additional unpermitted airspace capacity included in the footprints of these landfills. We believe it is probable that this unpermitted airspace capacity will be permitted in the future based on our analysis of site conditions, past regulatory approvals on adjacent property, and our interactions with regulators on applicable regulations, although there can be no assurance that any additional unpermitted airspace capacity will be permitted in the future.
We also operate a caprock injection well in Winnie, Texas with full Class 1 and 2 non-hazardous industrial waste disposal capabilities. Utilizing proprietary low-pressure injection technology, the deep-well asset provides the unique ability to efficiently dispose of difficult to treat non-hazardous industrial waste streams, including high metals, high ammonia, high solids, flammable exempt, and leachate. Based on an independent determination of the injection capacity of the caprock formation in which we inject waste and our own estimates of projected injection volumes, we believe the remaining disposal capacity of the formation will be sufficient to meet our disposal needs for the foreseeable future.
We operate seven wastewater treatment facilities located in Detroit, Michigan; Canton, Ohio; Harvey, Illinois; York, Pennsylvania; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Vernon, California that offer a range of wastewater treatment technologies. These facilities also have RCRA-permitted storage capabilities where waste may be stored prior to treatment onsite or transfer to another RCRA facility for treatment and disposal. We also operate a hazardous and non-hazardous industrial waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility in Tilbury, Ontario, Canada. The facility is permitted by the Ontario Ministry of Environment and specializes in the treatment of non- hazardous hydrocarbon contaminated solids to industrial re-use standards.
We break our Waste Solutions segment treatment and disposal (“T&D”) revenue into two categories, based on the underlying nature of the revenue source: “Base Business” and “Event Business.”
Base Business consists of waste streams from ongoing industrial activities and tends to be reoccurring in nature. Our strategy is to expand our Base Business while securing both short-term and extended-duration Event Business. We define Event Business as non-recurring projects that are expected to equal or exceed 1,000 tons, with Base Business defined as all other business not meeting the definition of Event Business. The duration of Event Business projects can last from a several-week cleanup of a contaminated site to a multiple year cleanup project.

6



Base Business represented approximately 76% and 73% of disposal revenue (excluding transportation) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Event Business contributed approximately 24% and 27% of disposal revenue (excluding transportation) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
When Base Business covers our fixed overhead costs, a significant portion of disposal revenue generated from Event Business is generally realized as operating income and net income. This strategy takes advantage of the operating leverage inherent to the largely fixed-cost nature of the waste disposal business. Contribution margin is influenced by whether the waste is directly disposed (“direct disposal”) or requires the application of chemical reagents, absorbents or other additives (variable costs) to treat the waste prior to disposal.
A significant portion of our T&D revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business projects which vary widely in size, duration and unit pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 24% of our T&D revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event Business, diverse spectrum of waste types received and widely varying unit pricing necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability may be influenced by general and industry-specific economic conditions, funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions or court orders, public controversy, litigation, weather, commercial real estate, closed military bases and other project timing, government appropriation and funding cycles and other factors. The types and amounts of Base Business waste received also vary quarter to quarter, sometimes significantly, but are generally more predictable than Event Business.
The types of waste received, also referred to as “service mix,” can produce significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year variations in revenue, average selling price, gross profit, gross margin, operating profit and net income for both Base Business and Event Business.
Recycling Services
We operate recycling technologies designed to reclaim valuable commodities from hazardous waste, including oil-bearing waste, metal-bearing waste, batteries, electronics, airport deicing fluid and other solvent-based wastes for industrial clients. The recycling and reclamation process involves the treatment of wastes using various recovery methods to effectively remove contaminants from the original material to restore its usefulness and to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal.
We offer full-service storm water management and propylene glycol recovery at major airports. Recovered fluids are transported to our RCRA Part B and CWT permitted chemical recycling facility where they are recycled into a greater than 99% pure material that is sold to industrial users.
We also operate a thermal desorption unit at our Robstown, Texas facility that recovers oil and metal bearing catalyst from refinery and other organic and oil-based waste. The recycled oil and recycled catalyst are sold to third parties.
Transportation
For waste transported by rail from locations distant from our facilities, transportation-related revenue can vary significantly and can account for as significant portion of total project revenue. While bundling transportation and disposal services may reduce overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenue (“gross margin”), this value-added service has allowed us to win multiple projects that we believe we could not have otherwise competed for successfully. Our Company-owned fleet of gondola railcars, which is periodically supplemented with railcars obtained under operating leases, has reduced our transportation expenses by largely eliminating reliance on more costly short-term rentals. These Company-owned railcars also help us to win business during times of demand-driven railcar scarcity. We also utilize a variety of specially designed and constructed Company-owned tanker trucks and trailers as well as various third-party transporters to support this activity. Further, to maximize utilization of our railcar fleet, we periodically deploy available railcars to transport waste from cleanup sites to disposal facilities operated by other companies. Such transportation services may also be bundled with logistics and field services support work.

Field Services Segment
Our Field Services include a wide range of specialty and total waste management services provided to refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, and other government, commercial and industrial facilities either on-site or at our network of facilities located throughout the United States. Specialty services include industrial cleaning and maintenance, retail services, remediation, lab pack, transportation and emergency response. Our specialty and total waste management services are organized into service lines including Emergency Response, Standby Services, Small Quantity Generation, Remediation Services, Total Waste Management, Transfer and Processing, and Industrial Services.
Emergency Response
Our primary emergency response offerings include spill response, waste analysis and treatment and disposal planning. We also offer remediation, product transfers, spill contingency planning and yearly service agreements with first responder status. Trained, experienced professionals operate the Global Response Operations Center to coordinate the Company’s emergency response services 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The Company may self-perform or utilize its independent contractor network to provide emergency response services.
Standby Services
We provide government-mandated, commercial standby oil spill compliance solutions to companies that store, transport, produce or handle petroleum and certain nonpetroleum oils on or near U.S. waters. Our standby services customers pay annual retainer fees under long-term or evergreen contracts for access to our regulatory certifications, specialized assets and highly trained personnel, who are on call 24 hours per day, seven days per week to respond to marine-based oil spill and hazardous materials emergencies. 
Small Quantity Generation
Our small quantity generation service offerings consist of retail services, laboratory packing, less than truckload (“LTL”), and household hazardous waste (“HHW”) collection. Retail services, laboratory packing, LTL and HHW are full-service waste characterization, packaging, collection and transportation programs. Services are provided to small, medium and large industrial and commercial customers. These programs are built on our network of service centers, employ highly trained staff and provide a high level of service to the customer. As an integral part of our services, we operate a network of service centers that characterize, package and collect hazardous and non-hazardous wastes from customers and transport such wastes to and between our facilities for treatment or bulking for shipment to final disposal locations. Customers typically accumulate wastes in containers, such as 55 gallon drums, bulk storage tanks or 20 cubic yard roll-off containers. We utilize a variety of specially designed and constructed tank trucks and semi-trailers as well as third-party transporters, including railroads. Depending on customer needs and competitive economics, transportation services may be offered at or near our cost to help secure new business.
Remediation Services
Our remediation service offerings include project management, RCRA and TSCA closures, excavations, wastewater management, building decontamination, demolition, landfill capping and site reclamation.
Total Waste Management (“TWM”)
Through our TWM programs, customers outsource a portion of their sustainability programs to us, allowing us to perform, organize and coordinate their field services activities, waste services needs and environmental compliance.
Transfer and Processing
Our transfer and processing stations stage and consolidate non-bulk loads of hazardous, non-hazardous and universal waste into full loads for more efficient shipment to Company-owned or third-party treatment and disposal facilities. This allows 

8



us to offer a broader geographic presence without having a dedicated, Company-owned treatment or disposal facility in the region.
Industrial Services
Our primary industrial service offerings include industrial cleaning and maintenance for refineries, chemical plants, steel and automotive plants, as well as tank cleaning and temporary storage.
Energy Waste Segment
We own and operate three landfills located in Karnes County, Texas; Pecos County, Texas and Reagan County, Texas that specialize in the disposal of drill cuttings, drilling muds and other oil field related waste streams regulated by the RRC. In addition, we own property in Andrews County, Texas, that is permitted for development as a waste disposal site for similar waste streams. These facilities are supported by a network of related oil field services capabilities including transportation, equipment rental, emergency response and other oil field services work.
​
As of December 31, 2021, the capacity used in the calculation of the useful economic lives of our three Energy Waste landfills includes approximately 27.2 million cubic yards of remaining permitted airspace capacity.
We also operate five additional domestic biosolid wastewater treatment facilities in Texas. These domestic wastewater treatment operations involve processing domestic wastewater through the use of physical, biological and chemical treatment methods. Our domestic wastewater treatment facilities treat a broad range of domestic wastewaters. Following treatment, the clean water is discharged under a NPDES permit while residual solids are transported to an offsite landfill.
Services include spill containment and site remediation, equipment cleaning & maintenance services, specialty equipment rental, including tanks, pumps and containment, safety monitoring and management and transportation and disposal.
Waste Services Industry
During the 1970s and 1980s, waste services industry growth in the United States was driven by new environmental laws and actions by federal and state agencies to regulate existing hazardous waste management facilities and direct the cleanup of contaminated sites under the federal Superfund law. By the early 1990s, excess hazardous waste management capacity had been constructed by the industry. Over this same period, in order to better manage risk and reduce expenses, many waste generators instituted industrial process changes and other methods to reduce waste production. These factors led to highly competitive market conditions that still apply today.
In the United States, hazardous waste is regulated under the RCRA, which created a cradle-to-grave system governing defined hazardous waste from the point of generation to ultimate disposal. RCRA requires waste generators to distinguish between “hazardous” and “non-hazardous” wastes, and to treat, store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations. Generally, entities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste must obtain a permit, either from the USEPA or from a state agency to which the USEPA has delegated such authority. Similar regulations and management methods apply to hazardous waste generation in Canada, which is regulated by the Canada Ministry of Environment and delegated to provincial agencies.
Disposal facilities are typically designed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants into the environment. The most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in an engineered disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment or deep-well injection. RCRA’s hazardous waste permitting program establishes specific requirements that must be followed when managing those wastes.
In the United States, waste intrinsically derived from primary field operations associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation under RCRA Subtitle C. The RCRA Subtitle C exemption, however, does not preclude these wastes from control under state regulations, under the less stringent RCRA Subtitle D solid waste regulations, or under other federal regulations. Our landfills that support this industry are regulated by the RRC. Similar to RCRA-regulated landfills, our RRC-regulated landfills are engineered using state of the 

9



art design and constructed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants into the environment.
OPA-90, a regulatory framework for the protection of the environment from oil spills following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, also imposes obligations on operators and owners of facilities, such as refineries, pipelines and E&P platforms and requires them to have a USCG compliant spill response plan.
We believe that a baseline demand for hazardous and non-hazardous waste services will continue into the future with fluctuations driven by general and industry-specific economic conditions, identification and prioritization of new cleanup needs, cleanup project schedules, funding availability, regulatory changes and other public policy decisions. We will also continue to advance plans and business lines that promote sustainable recycling technologies and expect the recycling portion of our business to displace some of our base disposal services over time. We further believe that the ability to deliver specialized niche services while aggressively competing for large volume cleanup projects and non-niche commodity business opportunities differentiates successful from less successful companies. We seek to control variable costs, expand service lines, increase waste throughput efficiency, employ innovative treatment techniques, provide complementary transportation and logistics services, build market share and increase profitability.
Our Richland, Washington disposal facility, serving the Northwest and Rocky Mountain LLRW Compacts, is one of three operating Compact disposal facilities in the United States. While our Washington disposal facility has substantial unused capacity, it can only accept LLRW from the 11 western states comprising the two Compacts served. The Barnwell, South Carolina site, operated by Energy Solutions, Inc. (“Energy Solutions”), exclusively serves the three-state Atlantic Compact. A third LLRW disposal facility, licensed by Waste Control Specialists, LLC and located near Andrews, Texas serves the two-state Texas Compact and approved out-of-compact waste generators. Class A LLRW from states outside the Northwest Compact region may also be disposed at the commercial disposal site in Clive, Utah, also operated by Energy Solutions.
Increases in pricing at AEA licensed LLRW disposal facilities heightened demand for more cost-effective disposal options for soil, debris, consumer products, industrial wastes and other materials containing LARM, including “mixed wastes,” exhibiting both hazardous and radioactive properties. In addition to commercial demand, a substantial amount of LARM is generated by government cleanup projects. The USNRC, USEPA and USACE have authorized the use of hazardous waste disposal facilities to dispose of certain LARM, encouraging expansion of this compliant, cost-effective alternative. We have been successful at expanding our permits at four of our RCRA hazardous waste facilities to allow acceptance of additional LARM wastes.
Industrial Services Industry
The industrial services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of small companies performing a variety of cleaning, maintenance and other services to industrial based companies such as refineries, chemical plants and steel and automotive plants. We believe customers increasingly desire to shift high fixed costs to lower variable costs by outsourcing waste management and industrial services. Some companies, such as power generation plants, petroleum refineries and chemical processors, are required to perform specialized “turnaround” maintenance only once or twice per year, making it impractical and cost-prohibitive to purchase expensive, specialized equipment, comply with complex permits and employ full-time specialized technicians required to perform those services. Similarly, the regulatory requirements of characterizing, manifesting, transporting and properly disposing of waste has led many companies to outsource this function to specialists. Our network of service centers and treatment, recycling and storage facilities provides a national footprint allowing us to serve these customers, while at the same time internalizing the waste to our own facilities.
Industrial services generally have low barriers to entry and customers are frequently won based on quality of service, reputation, health and safety record, logistics and price. This low barrier to entry has fostered a fragmented and competitive marketplace.

10



Emergency Response and Standby Services Industry
We provide emergency spill response services and marine-based standby oil spill compliance (the “standby services”) in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom and other international locations. 
Our emergency spill response services are designed to address both large-scale and small-scale response events. Large-scale response services typically result from natural disasters such as hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes as well as large industrial accidents such as pipeline spills, industrial fires, rail car derailments and marine vessel accidents. These large emergency response events are inherently difficult to predict, and when they occur can result in a significant revenue opportunity. Our small-scale emergency response services address smaller recurring industrial and transportation accidents or discharges. With the combination of our nationwide footprint, our vast service capabilities and specialized asset base, we believe the demand for these emergency response services will increase in line with overall industrial activity. We respond to multiple small-scale spill events per day, every day, across the United States.
Our standby services customers pay annual retainer fees under long-term or evergreen contracts for access to regulatory certifications, specialized assets and highly trained personnel, who are on call 24 hours per day, seven days per week to respond to an oil spill or other hazardous materials emergency response events.
OPA-90 mandates certain oil spill response coverage for companies that store, transport, produce or handle petroleum and certain non-petroleum oils on or near U.S. ports, harbors and other waters.
Our standby services business is the only national commercial OSRO in the United States and the only commercial provider of standby services that satisfies the requirements of both OPA-90 and other federal, state and municipal requirements. In addition, we hold the highest oil spill contractor classification offered by the USCG. We maintain an installed base of specialized oil spill response equipment and highly trained personnel around the United States to ensure rapid response capabilities. We provide government-mandated standby compliance solutions to more than 2,000 customers that cover approximately 20,000 assets, including tank and non-tank vessels, barges, petrochemical facilities, pipelines, refineries and other assets.
Additionally, our internal standby services business is augmented by our network of over 200 independent contractors throughout the United States to ensure expedient response times in any location. These independent contractors provide both personnel and, if required, equipment, to meet the immediate needs of our customers. Contractors must meet stringent requirements to become part of our network. Our contractors are paid when an event occurs for work that is actually completed and, as such, do not receive any of our annual standby retainer payments.
Our standby services business is a recurring, retainer-based business model that provides opportunity for incremental marine spill response revenue. To the extent a standby services retainer customer has a spill incident, we coordinate and manage the spill response by leveraging both internal resources and our independent contractor network. We generate incremental revenue with respect to services provided through internal resources and independent contractors on all response events, in addition to the annual retainer payments we collect each year.
Our standby services contribution margin is very high in light of the expansive infrastructure that is already in place. These services are government-mandated for our customers and serve as a low-cost yet invaluable “insurance policy” in the event of an incident. High barriers to entry, driven by the high cost of infrastructure necessary to achieve economies of scale, the high cost of failure, and regulatory certification requirements, have resulted in minimal new market competitors since market inception. 
Mexico represents a growth opportunity for us. The recently privatized Mexican oil and gas market has resulted in the Mexican government actively auctioning off blocks for offshore exploration to leading global oil companies. Although OPA-90 only applies to United States territories, the Mexican government and many leading global and U.S.-based companies seek OSRO-type coverage similar to that required in the United States and other countries. Our primary standby services competitor is currently unable to operate outside of U.S. waters, which leaves us well-positioned to be the provider of choice for these services internationally. This advantage has helped us become a leading OSRO in Mexico.

Strategy
Our strategy is to capitalize on our difficult-to-replicate combination of treatment, recycling and disposal assets and complementary service lines to provide a full service offering to customers and increase market share in the diverse markets we serve. We believe our focus on sustainability, workforce safety and protecting the environment, as well as our passionate commitment to customer service, provides for a long-term sustainable business model. In addition to organic growth initiatives, we may from time to time pursue acquisition opportunities to expand our geographic reach, service lines and customer base. The principal elements of our business strategy are to:
Execute Best-in-Class Sustainability and Environmental Compliance Programs. 
The cornerstone of our business is providing solutions that help us and our customers protect human health and the environment. In doing so, we pursue best-in-class safety and environmental compliance at US Ecology. Our customers and regulators rely on our expertise when they select us as a vendor or grant us permits and licenses. We deploy significant resources in terms of human capital, information technology, programs and facility investments to achieve safe and compliant operations that protect the environment and all stakeholders. The Company has dedicated professionals who oversee and manage safety and environmental programs including, but not limited to, employee training, internal and independent external audits, incentive programs and the Safety & Health Achievement Recognition Program. Various US Ecology facilities have obtained third-party verification of Environmental Health and Safety programs through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (“OSHA”) Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”) or ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 accreditation. Senior managers regularly review and discuss environmental and safety results and performance with operational staff, management and the Company’s Board of Directors to improve our safety results and focus on regulatory compliance. Sustainability targets are also an important component of our company-wide incentive programs.
Leverage Regulatory Expertise to Expand Permit Capabilities and Broaden Cost-Effective Service Offerings. We have a proven track record of leveraging more than six decades of regulatory experience to broaden our service offerings. Working with customers, we assess market opportunities in relation to existing laws, regulations and permit conditions. Our engineering, operational and regulatory affairs personnel then seek authority to implement innovative processes and technologies and accept additional types of waste by modifying our existing permits or obtaining new permits.
Continue to Build on Our Robust Waste Handling Infrastructure to Increase Revenue from Existing Assets. We believe we have a difficult to replicate set of treatment, recycling and disposal assets in the highly regulated hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste industry. We aim to enhance treatment capabilities at our existing facilities to handle additional waste streams and increase throughput. We also continue to invest in equipment and infrastructure to ensure that we have ample throughput capacity to expand our Event Business while continuing to support our Base Business customers.
Execute on Marketing Initiatives to Grow Organically. Our sales team is focused on high margin, niche wastes that our competitors may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations for or handle cost-effectively. We seek to expand into new markets and offer new services allowing us to cross-sell or bundle services and ultimately drive incremental volume into our existing disposal facilities. In our Waste Solutions segment, our strategy is to achieve Base Business at a level that covers our fixed overhead costs and delivers a reasonable profit, which allows the majority of our Event Business revenue to be realized as operating profit. We aim to continue building our Base Business while remaining flexible enough to handle large cleanup events. In our Field Services segment, our strategy is to provide value-added services that generate downstream waste treatment and disposal opportunities for our Waste Solutions segment while expanding service offerings to existing customers.
Deliver Innovative Technological Solutions. We challenge ourselves to identify innovative and technology-driven solutions to solve our customers’ waste management challenges. Past examples include leveraging our expertise in developing waste treatment recipes for organic and metals-bearing wastes, utilizing waste as a reagent to treat other wastes, beneficial reuse of select wastes, partnering with an innovative technology provider to deploy thermal desorption technology to recover and recycle oil and metal catalyst from refinery waste, and stabilizing mercury laden waste and other wastes using a patented treatment process.

12



Pursue a Disciplined Acquisition Strategy to Add Complementary Capabilities. We pursue selective acquisitions to expand our disposal network, customer base and geographic footprint. We have had success achieving this in recent years through our targeted acquisition strategy, acquiring EQ Holdings, Inc. (“EQ”) in 2014, Environmental Services Inc. (“ESI”) and the Vernon, California based RCRA Part B, liquids and solids waste treatment and storage facility of Evoqua Water Technologies LLC in 2016, ES&H of Dallas, LLC (“ES&H Dallas”) and Ecoserv Industrial Disposal, LLC (“Winnie”) in 2018, NRC and W.I.S.E. Environmental Solutions Inc. (“US Ecology Sarnia”) in 2019 and Impact Environmental Services, Inc. in 2020. The acquisition of NRC allowed us to expand our operations as a leading provider of emergency response and standby services while also providing a network of over 50 locations to leverage our field service capabilities, industrial services and total waste management programs. In addition, the NRC Merger provided us an entry into specialty landfill and waste services supporting upstream oil and gas exploration. We may from time to time seek acquisition opportunities to further expand our service offerings across the environmental services value chain while maintaining our commitment to compliance, safety and customer service excellence.
Competitive Strengths
Difficult-to-Replicate Infrastructure. We consider our disposal facilities to be difficult to replicate due to the longstanding regulatory and public policy environment for hazardous waste processing facilities, which includes the generally high cost of obtaining permits, multi-year permitting timeframes, uncertainty of outcome, high initial capital expenditures and the potential for both broad-based and local community opposition to the development of new facilities. We operate five of 20 landfills in the United States and Canada that are permitted to accept RCRA wastes. Our Richland, Washington LLRW facility is one of only three full-service Class A, B, and C disposal facilities in the United States. We also operate three landfills in Texas supporting the oil and gas exploration industry that are constructed to specifications set forth under Subtitle D of RCRA and the RRC, with a fourth location also owned by us and permitted by the RRC, but not yet constructed. Additionally, our marine resource network provides us with priority access to an extensive network of marine assets, and our aerial resource network enables us to coordinate cargo logistics and dispersant services, with priority access to a significant number of helicopters and fixed-wing planes. Our rapid response capabilities and strategically-located facilities enable us to rapidly deploy assets and personnel within 24 hours depending on the proximity of necessary equipment. Replacing or replicating our fleet of vessels and barges utilized by our standby services business would be difficult and costly for potential competitors because our vessels are customized with oil spill recovery equipment and other vessel modifications specifically designed to enhance our effectiveness.
Specialized Asset Base and Essential Regulatory Certifications. We maintain a specialized asset base and essential regulatory certifications to respond to environmental events throughout the globe whenever such events occur. We have a broad fleet of vessels, marine equipment, vehicles, rolling stock and other equipment that requires extensive training and expertise to operate. Replacing or replicating our fleet of vessels and barges utilized by our Field Services segment would be difficult and costly for potential competitors because our vessels are customized with oil spill recovery equipment and other vessel modifications specifically designed to enhance our effectiveness. Federal, state and local legislation and other environmental agencies require numerous certifications and accreditations. These certifications are often cost and time prohibitive to obtain and require expensive multi-step, complex permitting processes. We have decades of experience successfully permitting and maintaining regulatory compliance. Certain of our barges have also been grandfathered into certain regulatory requirements. Certain of our vessels, because they are used exclusively as oil spill response vessels, are exempt from certain regulatory requirements. For example, regulations requiring barges carrying oil to have double hulls generally do not impact our current fleet. Our specialized asset base, essential regulatory certifications and entrenched market position pose a barrier to entry for potential competitors.
Significant Regulatory and Operating Expertise. We operate in a highly regulated marketplace. The permitting process for operating disposal assets in our industry is lengthy and complex, requiring a deep understanding of federal and state hazardous and radioactive waste laws and regulations. We maintain a regulatory compliance and permitting program at our disposal facilities that has allowed us to obtain approvals to expand our service offering in terms of the types, amounts and concentrations of wastes that we are authorized to accept. Our track record of successfully navigating government regulatory and permitting processes has been a consistent competitive advantage.
A Market Leader in Hazardous & Non-Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal. We are a leader in the hazardous waste services sector with more than six decades of experience. Our collection of disposal assets and proprietary treatment 

13



technologies, combined with our transportation network, provides us with coast-to-coast treatment and disposal capabilities, allowing us to serve a diverse mix of customers and industries.
Comprehensive Waste Services. Our comprehensive waste service offerings allow us to act as a full-service provider to our customers. Our full-service orientation creates incremental revenue growth as customers seek to minimize the number of outside vendors through “one-stop” service providers.
Diverse Markets and Customer Base. In 2021, we serviced more than 8,000 commercial and governmental entities, such as refineries, chemical production facilities, heavy manufacturers, steel mills, oil and gas exploration companies, waste brokers and medical and academic institutions. Our broad range of end-markets gives us exposure to a variety of industrial cycles, lessening the impact of market volatility.
Solid Safety and Compliance Record. Safety and environmental compliance is a cornerstone of US Ecology’s business. The Company has dedicated professionals who oversee and manage safety and environmental programs including, but not limited to, employee training, internal and independent external audits, incentive programs and the Safety & Health Achievement Recognition Program. Various US Ecology facilities have obtained third-party verification of Environmental Health and Safety programs through OSHA’s VPP or ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 accreditation. Senior managers regularly review and discuss environmental and safety results and performance with operational staff, management and the Company’s Board of Directors to improve our safety results and focus on regulatory compliance.
Competition
Our Waste Solutions segment competes with large and small companies in each of the commercial markets we serve. While niche services apply, the radioactive, hazardous and non-hazardous industrial waste management industry is generally very competitive. We believe that our primary hazardous waste and PCB disposal competitors are Clean Harbors, Inc., Heritage Environmental Services and Waste Management, Inc. Other hazardous waste disposal competitors include, but are not limited to, Tradebe, Ross Environmental, Harsco Corporation and Veolia Environmental Services. Our waste disposal competitors serving the Permian and Eagle Ford oil fields include Waste Management, Waste Connections, Milestone Environmental, Republic Services and Buchanan Disposal Solutions. In addition, we face competition from reserve pit disposal, slurry wells, thermal recycling, saltwater caverns and land farming. We believe that our primary radioactive material disposal competitors are Energy Solutions, Inc. and Waste Control Specialists, Inc. We believe the principal competitive factors applicable to these businesses are:

● | price;
--+-------


● | specialized permits and “niche” service offerings;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | customer service;
--+------------------


● | operational efficiency and technical expertise;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | comprehensive and bundled services;
--+------------------------------------


● | regulatory compliance and worker safety;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | industry reputation and brand name recognition;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | transportation distance; and
--+-----------------------------


● | state or province and local community support.
--+-----------------------------------------------

Competition within our Field Services segment varies by locality and type of service rendered, with competition coming from large national and regional service providers and hundreds of privately-owned firms that offer field or industrial services. We believe that our primary field services competitors are Clean Harbors, Inc., Harsco Corporation, Heritage Environmental Services, Tradebe, Veolia Environmental Services and Waste Management, Inc. Each of these competitors is able to provide most if not all of the field services we offer. We believe that our primary standby services competitor is Marine Spill Response Corporation, a not-for-profit USCG-classified OSRO.
We believe that we are competitive in all markets we serve and that we offer a unique mix of services, including niche technologies and services that favorably distinguish us from competitors. We also believe that our strong brand name recognition from six decades of experience, compliance and safety record, customer service reputation and positive relations with regulators and local communities enhance our competitive position. Advantages exist for competitors that 

14



(1) are larger in scale, (2) have technology, permits or equipment to handle a broader range of waste, (3) operate in jurisdictions imposing lower disposal fees and/or (4) are located closer to where wastes are generated.
Permits, Licenses and Regulatory Requirements
Obtaining authorization to construct and operate new waste disposal facilities is a lengthy and complex process. We believe we have demonstrated significant expertise in this area over multiple decades. We also believe we possess all permits, licenses and regulatory approvals required to maintain regulatory compliance and operate our facilities and have the specialized expertise required to obtain additional approvals to continue growing our business in the future.
We incur costs and make capital investments to comply with environmental regulations. These regulations require that we operate our facilities in accordance with permit-specific requirements. Most of our facilities are also required to provide financial assurance for closure and post-closure obligations should our facilities cease operations. Both human resource and capital investments are required to maintain compliance with these requirements.
United States Hazardous Waste Regulation
Our hazardous, industrial, non-hazardous and radioactive waste treatment, disposal and handling business is subject to extensive federal and state environmental, health, safety, and transportation laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Local government controls and regulations may also apply. The applicable government regulatory agencies regularly inspect our operations to monitor compliance. Such agencies have authority to enforce compliance through the suspension or revocation of operating licenses and permits and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in case of violations. We believe that these laws and regulations, as well as the specialized services we provide, contribute to demand and create barriers to new competitors seeking to enter the markets we serve.
RCRA provides a comprehensive framework for regulating hazardous waste transportation, treatment, storage and disposal. RCRA regulation is the responsibility of the USEPA, which may delegate authority to state agencies. Chemical compounds and residues derived from USEPA-listed industrial processes are subject to RCRA standards unless they are delisted through rulemaking. RCRA liability may be imposed for improper waste management or failure to take corrective action for releases of hazardous substances. To the extent wastes are recycled or beneficially reused, regulatory controls and permitting requirements under RCRA diminish. LARM and NORM/NARM may also be managed to varying degrees under RCRA permits, as is authorized for our facilities in Grand View, Idaho, Beatty, Nevada, Belleville, Michigan and Robstown, Texas.
CWA legislation prohibits discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and treatment facilities. The USEPA has promulgated “pretreatment” regulations under the CWA, which establish pretreatment standards for introduction of pollutants into publicly-owned treatment works. In the course of the treatment process, our wastewater treatment facilities generate wastewater that we discharge to publicly-owned treatment works pursuant to permits issued by the appropriate governmental authority. We are required to obtain discharge permits and conduct sampling and monitoring programs.
CERCLA and its amendments impose strict, joint and several liability on owners or operators of facilities where a release of hazardous substances has occurred, on parties who generated hazardous substances released at such facilities and on parties who arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA may be imposed if improper releases of hazardous substances occur at treatment, storage or disposal sites. Since waste generators, transporters and those who arrange transportation are subject to the same liabilities, we believe these parties are motivated to minimize the number of disposal sites used. In addition, hazardous waste generated during the remediation of CERCLA cleanup projects and transferred offsite must be managed by a treatment and disposal facility authorized by the USEPA to manage CERCLA waste.
TSCA regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of PCBs. U.S. regulation and licensing of PCB wastes is the responsibility of the USEPA. Our Grand View, Idaho and Beatty, Nevada facilities have TSCA treatment, storage and disposal permits. Our Belleville, Michigan facility has a TSCA disposal permit. Our Robstown, Texas facility has a TSCA 

15



storage permit and may dispose of PCB-contaminated waste in limited concentrations not requiring a TSCA disposal permit.
The AEA assigns the USNRC regulatory authority over receipt, possession, use and transfer of certain radioactive materials, including disposal. The USNRC has adopted regulations for licensing commercial LLRW disposal and has delegated regulatory authority to certain states including Washington, where our Richland facility is located. The USNRC and U.S. Department of Transportation regulate the transport of radioactive materials. Shippers must comply with both the general requirements for hazardous materials transportation and specific requirements for transporting radioactive materials.
Waste intrinsically derived from primary field operations associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas is exempt from regulation under RCRA Subtitle C. The RCRA Subtitle C exemption, however, does not preclude these wastes from control under state regulations, under the less stringent RCRA Subtitle D solid waste regulations, or under other federal regulations. Our landfills that support this industry are regulated by the RRC. Similar to RCRA-regulated landfills, our RRC-regulated landfills are engineered using state of the art design and constructed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants into the environment.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the AEA to classify discrete (i.e. concentrated versus diffuse) NORM/NARM as byproduct material. The law does not apply to interstate Compacts ratified by Congress pursuant to the LLRW Policy Act.
Our transportation operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the USCG, as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass, including but not limited to the RRC.
OPA-90 establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills. Enacted by Congress in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez tanker oil spill in Alaska, OPA-90 (1) consolidated the existing federal oil spill laws under one program, (2) expanded the existing liability provisions within the CWA and (3) established new freestanding requirements regarding marine oil spill prevention and response. Under its provisions, all U.S. tank vessels, offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities (including pipelines, refineries and terminals) are required to prepare and submit oil spill response plans to the relevant federal agency. In general, these vessels and facilities are prohibited from handling, storing and transporting oil if they do not have a plan approved by (or submitted to) the appropriate agency. The plans must provide, among other things, details of how the owner or operator of a vessel or facility would respond to a “worst case” scenario spill. While every vessel or facility is not required to have all of the personnel and equipment needed to respond to a “worst case” spill, they each must have a plan and procedures to call upon (typically through a contractual relationship with an OSRO), the necessary equipment and personnel for responding to such a spill within a prescribed timeframe.
In 2004, Congress amended OPA-90 to require that all vessels over 400 gross tons (not just tankers) prepare and submit a vessel response plan, as many non-tank vessels pose the same oil spill risk as small tank vessels due to the comparable volume of oil they have onboard for fuel. In 2013, regulations for non-tank vessels were further tightened, and OPA-90 compliance now requires that non-tank vessel operators contract directly with an OSRO.
The OSRO classification process was developed to facilitate the preparation and review of facility and vessel response plans. The OSRO classification process represents standard guidelines by which the USCG and plan developers can evaluate an OSRO’s potential to respond to and recover oil spills of various sizes. OSROs are classified based on the location of response resources and an assessment of the ability to mobilize those resources to the Captain of the Port (“COTP”) city or alternate classification city. There are equipment standards and response times specific to each operating area within a COTP zone. Customers that arrange for the services of a USCG-classified OSRO do not have to list their response resources in their response plans. In addition to potential liability under the federal OPA-90, vessel owners may in some instances incur liability on an even more stringent basis under state law in the particular state where the spillage occurred.

Canadian Hazardous Waste Regulation
The Canadian federal government regulates issues of national scope where activities cross provincial boundaries and affect Canada’s relations with other nations. The Canadian provinces retain control over environmental matters within their respective boundaries, including primary responsibility for regulation and management of hazardous waste.
The main federal laws governing hazardous waste management are CEPA and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. Environment and Climate Change Canada is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters. CEPA charges Environment and Climate Change Canada and Health Canada with the protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production, importation and use of substances in Canada and their impact on the environment. The Export and Import of Hazardous Waste Regulations under CEPA govern trans-border movement of hazardous waste and hazardous recyclable materials. These regulations require that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous waste or hazardous recyclable materials or transport them through Canada notify the Minister of the Environment and obtain a permit to do so.
Our Stablex facility is located in Blainville, Québec, Canada and is subject to QEQA. This Act, independently developed by the Province, regulates the generation, characterization, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes. QEQA also provides for the establishment of waste management facilities which are controlled by the provincial statutes and regulations governing releases to air, groundwater and surface water.
Our Tilbury, Ontario, Canada facility is subject to Regulation 347 of the Ontario Environmental Protection Act (“Regulation 347”). Regulation 347, independently developed by the Province, regulates the collection, storage, transportation, treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes.
Waste transporters are required to hold a permit to operate under the provincial regulations and are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Transportation of Dangerous Goods law, which requires reporting of quantities and disposition of materials shipped.
A major difference between the United States regulatory regime and that of Canada relates to ownership and liability. Under Canadian federal regulation, ownership changes when waste is transferred to a properly permitted third-party carrier and subsequently to an approved treatment and disposal facility. As a result, the generator is no longer liable for proper handling, treatment or disposal once the waste is transferred. In the United States, joint and several liability is retained by the waste generator as well as the transporter and the treatment and disposal facility.
Maritime Regulations
We own and use in our operations 37 vessels registered under the U.S. flag. Accordingly, we are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of our vessels. Our U.S.-flag vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the USCG, the United States Customs and Border Protection and the United States Maritime Administration. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the local laws of foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
A portion of the operations of our standby services business is conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade. This is a protected market that is subject to U.S. cabotage laws that impose certain restrictions on the ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade. These laws are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. Chapters 121, 505 and 551 and the related regulations, which are commonly referred to collectively as the “Jones Act.” The Jones Act restricts transportation of merchandise by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act (“U.S. Citizens”), be built in and registered under the laws of the United States and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews.
Under the citizenship provisions of the Jones Act, we would not be permitted to engage in U.S. coastwise trade if more than 25% of any class or series of our outstanding equity was owned by non-U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act). For a corporation engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade to be deemed a U.S. Citizen: (1) the corporation must 

17



be organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof, (2) each of the chief executive officer, by whatever title, and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a U.S. Citizen, (3) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. Citizens, (4) at least 75% of the ownership and voting power of each class or series of the shares of the capital stock of such corporation must be owned and controlled by U.S. Citizens, free from any trust or fiduciary obligations in favor of non-U.S. Citizens and (5) there must be no contract or understanding or other means by which more than 25% of the voting power or control of such corporation may be exercised directly or indirectly by or on behalf of non-U.S. Citizens.
Our charter includes provisions (1) limiting the ownership of any class or series of our capital stock by non-U.S. Citizens to 24% (so as to allow a margin of safety under the statutory maximum of 25%), (2) prohibiting the transfer of shares of our capital stock if doing so would cause us to exceed the 24% non-U.S. Citizen ownership threshold (any such shares, the “Excess Shares”), (3) authorizing the redemption of Excess Shares by the Company, (4) suspending the right to vote and to receive dividends and distributions for such Excess Shares, (5) establishing procedures for the redemption of Excess Shares including providing notice and setting the redemption price, (6) authorizing us to make citizenship determinations with respect to the holders of our capital stock, (7) requiring holders (including beneficial holders) of our capital stock to submit information to establish the citizenship of such holder and (8) generally authorizing our Board of Directors to take appropriate action to monitor and maintain compliance with the ownership requirements of the Jones Act.
All of our offshore vessels are subject to either U.S. or international safety and classification standards, and sometimes both. U.S.-flag vessels, barges and crew boats are required to undergo periodic inspections pursuant to USCG regulations. 
We are in compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (the “ISPFS Code”), an amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) as implemented in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code provides that owners or operators of certain vessels and facilities must provide security and security plans for their vessels and facilities and obtain appropriate certification of compliance. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses and develop vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those U.S.-flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the USCG pursuant to the latest revision of Marsec Directive 104-6.
Insurance, Financial Assurance and Risk Management
We are required by law, license, permit and prudence to maintain various insurance instruments and financial assurances. We carry a broad range of insurance coverage including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, business interruption, workers compensation, directors and officers liability, environmental impairment liability, international and marine coverages in addition to other coverage customary for a company of our size in our industry. We purchase primary property, casualty and excess liability policies through traditional third-party insurance carriers. We are self-insured for employee healthcare coverage with stop-loss insurance covering excess liabilities.
Our domestic casualty insurance program provides coverage for commercial general liability, employer’s liability and automobile liability in the aggregate amount of $35.0 million each, per year, subject to a $250,000 retention per occurrence for our commercial general liability; a $350,000 deductible per occurrence for workers’ compensation and employer’s liability and a $500,000 deductible per occurrence for our automobile liability. Our workers compensation insurance limits are established by state statutes. Our Canadian casualty insurance program provides primary coverage for commercial general liability and automobile liability in the aggregate amount of $35.0 million each, per year, subject to a 50,000 Canadian dollars retention for general liability and deductibles starting from 500 Canadian dollars for automobile liability depending on applicable policy.
Our domestic property program provides coverage for real and personal property, business interruption and contractors’ equipment with a loss limit of $35.0 million, subject to a $2.5 million deductible per occurrence for property and business interruption and a $500,000 deductible per occurrence for contractors’ equipment. The program also includes flood, earthquake and wind coverage within the loss limit subject to applicable deductibles. For our Vernon, California facility, we maintain an additional $10.0 million of coverage for earthquakes subject to a $25,000 deductible per occurrence. A 

18



separate boiler and machinery program with a loss limit of $100.0 million for property damage and business interruption is also maintained. Our Canadian property program provides coverage for real and personal property, business interruption and contractors’ equipment with a loss limit of 93.0 million Canadian dollars, subject to applicable per-occurrence deductibles. This program includes flood, wind and earth-movement coverage within the stated loss limits. A separate Canadian boiler and machinery program with a loss limit of 93.0 million Canadian dollars is also maintained.
On November 17, 2018, an explosion occurred at our Grand View, Idaho facility. The incident severely damaged the facility’s primary waste-treatment building as well as surrounding waste handling, waste storage, maintenance and administrative support structures, resulting in the closure of the entire facility that remained in effect through January 2019. We completed the construction of a new treatment building and supporting infrastructure with resumption of full capabilities in 2021. We maintain workers’ compensation insurance, business interruption insurance and liability insurance for personal injury, property and casualty damage. We believe that any potential third-party claims associated with the explosion, in excess of our deductibles, are expected to be resolved primarily through our insurance policies. 
Federal, state and provincial regulations require financial assurance to cover the cost of final closure and post closure obligations at certain operating and non-operating disposal facilities. Acceptable forms of financial assurance include third-party standby letters of credit, surety bonds and insurance. Alternatively, we may be required to collect fees from waste generators to fund dedicated, state-controlled escrow or trust accounts during the operating life of the facility. Through December 31, 2021, we have met our financial assurance requirements through insurance, surety bonds, standby letters of credit and self-funded restricted trusts. As of December 31, 2021, we have provided collateral of $721,000 in funded trust agreements, $13.8 million in surety bonds, issued $2.8 million in letters of credit for financial assurance and have insurance policies of approximately $120.5 million for closure and post closure obligations (dedicated state-controlled closure and post closure funds provide financial assurance for our Washington and Nevada facilities). We use commercial surety bonds for our Canadian operations and for our Texas Energy Waste landfills. Our lease agreement with the Province of Québec requires that the surety bond be maintained for 25 years after the lease expires. As of December 31, 2021, we had $873,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations at our Blainville, Québec, Canada facility.
Primary casualty insurance programs generally do not cover accidental environmental contamination losses. Our domestic and Canadian pollution liability programs provide coverage for these types of losses in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million and 25.0 million Canadian dollars per year, respectively, each subject to a $250,000 retention per occurrence. We also carry domestic and Canadian contractors professional environmental liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $25.0 million and 5.0 million Canadian dollars per year, respectively. The domestic program is subject to a $250,000 retention per occurrence and the Canadian program is subject to a 25,000 Canadian dollars deductible per incident. We also have a combination of standalone RCRA site specific policies with total aggregate limit of $68.0 million subject to a $250,000 retention.
For nuclear liability coverage, we maintain Facility Form and Workers’ Form nuclear liability insurance provided under the federal Price Anderson Act. This insurance covers the operations of our facilities, suppliers and transporters.
Duplicative NRC insurance policies and/or programs were absorbed or combined throughout 2020, except for a separate and standalone property insurance program insuring the legacy NRC properties. This separate property policy provides blanket coverage limits of approximately $53.0 million for real and personal property, business interruption and equipment, up to $5.0 million annual aggregate for earthquake, flood, windstorm or hail and deductibles from $10,000 to $500,000 depending on peril and location.
Marine exposures are addressed through a robust marine insurance package including hull and machinery, protection and indemnity, vessel pollution and other liability and excess insurance coverages with total loss limits of $150.0 million.
International operations exposures are addressed under locally placed insurance policies compulsory in the specific countries of operation and benefit from excess and difference in condition coverages with total loss limits of $35.0 million.

Significant Customers
No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Seasonal Effects
Seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles can influence the timing of customer spending for our services. Typically, in the first quarter of each calendar year there is less demand for our services due to weather-related reduced construction activities. While large, multi-year cleanup projects may continue in winter months, the pace of waste shipments may be slower, or stop temporarily, due to weather. Market conditions and federal funding decisions generally have a greater influence on the business than seasonality.
Human Capital Resources
On December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,600 employees, of which approximately 300 in the United States and 200 outside of the United States were represented by various labor unions.
Our employees are our most valued asset at US Ecology. We believe that inclusion, equity, and diversity is essential to providing the best service to our customers. Through our Diversity and Inclusion Program, our team is focused on identifying our greatest opportunities to attract and develop diverse and high-performing talent. US Ecology pays our employees what we believe are market competitive wages, which include company-wide incentive programs and generous benefits to enable us to retain and develop employees into the future leaders of our industry.
We care about our employees’ experience and continuously measure and improve employment practices. Through annual surveys, town-hall meetings, and an open-door policy, employees influence and affect change in our policies, programs, and practices. Our annual engagement survey measures our progress while collecting anonymous feedback to provide perspective on what matters most to our people. This leads to better decisions about resource deployment, benefit programs, leader effectiveness, and the overall employment experience. These continuous improvements attempt to ensure we provide best-in-class services to our customers while enabling our business units to achieve their goals.
During 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our operations. To protect our employees, subcontractors and customers, we maintained our safety protocols and COVID-19 prevention procedures. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we continued our 80 hours of incremental COVID-19 paid time off in 2021, which allowed each team member to take time off to take care of themselves or their family when COVID-19 impacted their health, daycare or schooling. Finally, we formalized long-term remote and hybrid work programs.
