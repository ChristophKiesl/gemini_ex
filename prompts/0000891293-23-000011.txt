Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a commercial biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies for blood-related cancers where there is a significant unmet medical need. Our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize, either alone or with partners. We have one commercially approved product, VONJO® (pacritinib), which has received Accelerated Approval in the United States from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L. 
Our Strategy 
Our objective is to become a leader in the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for the treatment of blood-related cancers. The key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives are to:
•Successfully Commercialize VONJO. Since VONJO's approval by the FDA in February 2022, our commercial and supply infrastructure has enabled a successful commercial launch of VONJO. We continue to focus our efforts on the strategic and operational capabilities that support the ongoing commercialization of VONJO in the United States through the coordinated efforts of our sales, marketing and market access teams. 
•Evaluate Strategic Product Collaborations to Accelerate Development and Commercialization. Where we believe it may be beneficial, we intend to evaluate collaborations to broaden and accelerate the clinical trial development and commercialization of VONJO. Collaborations have the potential to generate non-equity-based operating capital, supplement our own internal expertise and provide us with access to the marketing, sales and distribution capabilities of our collaborators in specific territories.
•Identify and Acquire Additional Pipeline Opportunities. Historically, we have built our candidate pipeline using multiple approaches, including through licensing and acquiring assets that we believe were initially undervalued opportunities. We plan to continue to seek out additional product candidates in an opportunistic manner.

The following table summarizes our current product and development portfolio as of the date of this report: 
Oncology Market Overview and Opportunity 
According to the American Cancer Society, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, resulting in more than 600,000 deaths annually, or more than 1,600 deaths per day. Approximately 2.0 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2023 in the United States. While the exact prevalence of myelofibrosis is uncertain, it is estimated that there are approximately 21,000 myelofibrosis patients in the United States, 7,000 of whom have severe thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of less than 50 x109/L). The most commonly used methods for treating patients with cancer are

surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Patients usually receive a combination of these treatments depending upon the type and extent of their disease. 
We believe our expertise in blood-related cancers, together with our ability to identify unique therapies that address unmet medical needs that are potentially less toxic and more effective at treating and curing patients, may fill a significant unmet medical need for cancer patients.
Pacritinib 
Overview
Pacritinib is an oral kinase inhibitor with activity against wild type Janus Associated Kinase 2 (JAK2), mutant JAK2V617F form, IRAK1, ACVR1 (ALK2) and FLT3, which contribute to signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. At clinically relevant concentrations, pacritinib does not inhibit JAK1. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. Myelofibrosis is often associated with dysregulated JAK2 signaling. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, graft versus host disease, or GvHD, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, due to its inhibition of JAK2, IRAK1, FLT3, ACVR1 (ALK2) and CSF1R. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens. 
U.S. FDA Approval of VONJO
In September 2020, we reached an agreement with the FDA to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for the potential Accelerated Approval of VONJO as a treatment for myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and in March 2021 we completed our rolling NDA submission. The NDA was based on the available data from our completed Phase 3 PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 trials and the Phase 2 PAC203 trial. In May 2021, the FDA accepted our NDA and granted pacritinib Priority Review, with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date set for November 30, 2021, which was subsequently extended by three months to February 28, 2022. On February 28, 2022, the FDA granted Accelerated Approval of VONJO for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L. This indication is approved under FDA Accelerated Approval based on the surrogate end point of spleen volume reduction. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. As agreed with the FDA, the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial will be completed as a post-marketing requirement. On February 7, 2023, VONJO was granted seven years of orphan-drug exclusive approval by the FDA for treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x109/L, pursuant to section 527 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA (21 U.S.C. 360cc). The seven-year exclusive approval began on February 28, 2022.
PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 Trials
Pacritinib was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, collectively known as the PERSIST program, for patients with myelofibrosis. The PERSIST-1 trial evaluated pacritinib in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts, and the PERSIST-2 trial evaluated pacritinib in patients with low platelet counts. Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer associated with significantly reduced quality of life and shortened survival. As the disease progresses, the body slows production of important blood cells and within one year of diagnosis, the incidence of disease-related thrombocytopenia (very low blood platelet counts), severe anemia and red blood cell transfusion requirements increase significantly. Among other complications, most patients with myelofibrosis present with enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), as well as many other potentially devastating physical symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bone pain, feeling full after eating little, severe itching, night sweats and extreme fatigue. Currently patients with very low blood platelets, called severe thrombocytopenia, (<50,000/µL) have limited or no effective treatment options. Myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia have poor survival following discontinuation of therapy with the approved JAK1/JAK2 therapy. We believe pacritinib may offer effective treatment of splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. 
PERSIST-1 was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to BAT, excluding JAK inhibitors, in 327 patients with myelofibrosis, without exclusion for low platelet counts. 
In May 2015, data from PERSIST-1 showed that compared to BAT (exclusive of a JAK inhibitor) pacritinib therapy resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients with SVR and control of disease-related symptoms meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. Additionally, 25 percent of patients treated with pacritinib who were severely anemic and transfusion-dependent - requiring at least six units of blood in the 90 days prior to study entry - became transfusion-independent, compared to zero patients treated with BAT (p<0.05). The most common adverse events, occurring in 10 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were: mild to moderate diarrhea, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia and vomiting. Of the patients treated with pacritinib, three discontinued therapy and 13 patients required dose interruption (average one week) for diarrhea. Patients received a daily full dose of pacritinib over the duration of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms typically lasted for approximately one week and few patients discontinued treatment due to side effects. There were no Grade 4 gastrointestinal events reported. 
The PERSIST-2 trial was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center registration-directed Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib compared to BAT, including the approved JAK inhibitor dosed according to product label, for patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter (≤100,000/µL). The PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints showing a statistically significant SVR in patients treated with pacritinib combining the once- and twice-daily arms compared to BAT. The PERSIST-2 trial did not meet the other co-primary endpoint of greater than 50 percent reduction in TSS. Although secondary objectives could not be evaluated formally due to the study not achieving one of the primary objectives, when the two pacritinib dosing arms were evaluated separately versus BAT, pacritinib given twice daily showed a higher percent of SVR and TSS responses compared to BAT; whereas, pacritinib given once daily showed only a higher percent SVR responses compared to BAT. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia) and were generally less frequent for BID versus QD administration. The most common serious treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence of ≥5 percent reported in any treatment arm irrespective of grade) were anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia and acute renal failure none of which exceeded 8 percent individually in any arm. 
In February 2015, we received a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, in place at the time to terminate the PERSIST-1 trial and hold enrollment of new patients in the PERSIST-2 trial. The IDMC’s recommendation was based on non-statistically significant safety concerns, including mortality, in patients on pacritinib, particularly those who crossover after 24 weeks. On February 8, 2016, the FDA notified us that a full clinical hold had been placed on pacritinib clinical studies.
PAC203 Trial
In January 2017, the FDA removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both PERSIST-1 and -2 trials and a dose-exploration clinical trial protocol that the FDA requested. At that time, the PAC203 trial was designed to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with primary myelofibrosis and who had failed prior ruxolitinib therapy across three dose regimens of pacritinib, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy (SVR at 12 and 24 weeks). The 200 mg BID dose was selected as the top dose based upon observations from the completed PERSIST-2 study. In PAC203, the entry criteria were modified to exclude patients with a history of cardiac and/or bleeding events and additional dose modification guidelines were implemented for the management of treatment-emergent cardiac and or bleeding events. The first patient in the PAC203 trial was enrolled in July 2017. 
In April 2018, we amended the protocol to expand the sample size to a maximum of 150 patients (or 50 patients per arm) to collect additional data for the safety and efficacy analyses. In July 2018, we announced that the IDMC for the PAC203 trial completed its planned interim data review of the PAC203 trial and that the IDMC did not identify any drug- or dose-related safety concerns and did not identify any concerns about cardiac or bleeding events. Following meetings with the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and consultation with the IDMC, we eliminated the interim efficacy analysis and focused the second interim data review, and all subsequent data reviews, on an assessment of safety. The protocol was amended to reflect this change and submitted to FDA. In October 2018, we announced the continuation of the PAC203 Phase 2 study without modification, following a planned second interim data review by the IDMC. The IDMC did not identify significant drug- or dose-related safety concerns and specifically did not identify any concerns around hemorrhagic or cardiac toxicity. A complete dataset from the fully enrolled study (including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data) will be used to determine the optimal dose of pacritinib for further clinical development, as requested by the FDA. The PAC203 study was fully enrolled in December 2018. In January 2019, the IDMC completed its planned third interim safety review and recommended that the study continue without modification. 
In December 2019, we announced top-line efficacy and safety data for the PAC203 trial. Pacritinib was shown to be generally well tolerated across dosing cohorts. The majority of non-hematological adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and, with the exception of diarrhea, were considered unlikely related to pacritinib. The most common non-hematologic adverse events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhea (23.6%) and nausea (23.6%), and occurred more commonly in patients treated at 200 mg BID (31/54, 57.4%) than at lower doses (100 mg BID: 23/55, 41.8%, 100 mg QD: 22/52, 42.3%). These events were largely grade 1 or 2 in severity. Diarrhea was generally manageable with standard antidiarrheal agents, and only one patient (at 200mg BID) required drug discontinuation due to any gastrointestinal event (diarrhea). 
The most common hematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia and anemia, both occurring at higher frequencies at the 200 mg BID dose (35.2 percent and 24.1 percent respectively); this did not, however, lead to higher rates of Grade 3/4 hemorrhage at higher doses (200 mg BID: 5.6 percent; 100 mg BID: 0 percent; 100 mg QD: 7.7 percent; all Grade 3). Similarly, the highest dose saw no excess in Grade 3/4 cardiac (200 mg BID: 3.7 percent; 100 mg BID: 7.3 percent; 100 mg QD: 5.8; all grade 3). There were 10 Grade 5 (fatal) adverse events: 3 at 200 mg BID (sepsis, respiratory failure, subdural hematoma), 3 at 100 mg BID (disease progression, subdural hemorrhage, heart failure), and 4 at 100 mg QD (disease progression, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, tuberculosis).
The 200 mg BID arm had the highest observed rates of SVR ≥35 percent (200 mg BID: 9.3 percent; 100 mg BID: 1.8 percent; 100 mg QD: 0.0 percent). Of the 5 patients with SVR ≥35 percent at the 200 mg BID dose, 4 had platelet counts <50,000/µL, representing a 17 percent (4/24) response rate among patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Though a dose response relationship was not observed in total symptom score (TSS) based on the threshold of 50 percent reduction in symptom score, the median percent decrease in TSS (including fatigue) did show deeper reductions with escalating doses, with best response at 200 mg BID. At Week 24, the percent change in TSS from baseline was highest in the 200 mg pacritinib BID group (median ‑27.3%) compared with the other treatment groups (100 mg pacritinib BID group: median ‑16.0%; 100 mg pacritinib QD group: median ‑3.1%). Of the TSS (including fatigue) responders, baseline cytopenias were common: 8 of 12 had hemoglobin <10g/dL, and 4 of 12 had platelet counts <50,000/µL.
PACIFICA Phase 3 Trial
As part of the Accelerated Approval of VONJO, we agreed with the FDA to amend the design of PACIFICA to have co-primary endpoints of Spleen Volume Reduction, or SVR, and modified Total Symptom Score, or TSS, with both endpoints being analyzed after the complete enrollment of the study. As a result of this amendment, we increased the study size to 399 patients to maintain appropriate powering for the endpoints. This change was implemented in a study amendment that was submitted on June 30, 2022. In addition to co-primary endpoints SVR and TSS, overall survival is a secondary endpoint. Enrollment in this trial is progressing despite the challenges of conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, enrollment at sites in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus has been indefinitely paused in response to the conflict in the region. As agreed with the FDA, following the Accelerated Approval of VONJO, we plan to complete the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial as a post-marketing requirement, with the expected completion of enrollment by the end of 2026. Meeting this timeline is dependent upon the addition of new clinical sites. 
License Agreements 
S*BIO
We acquired the compounds SB1518 (which is referred to as “pacritinib”) and SB1578, which inhibit JAK2 and FLT3, from S*BIO Pte Ltd., or S*BIO, in May 2012. Under our agreement with S*BIO, we are required to make milestone payments to S*BIO up to an aggregate amount of $132.5 million if certain U.S., EU and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain worldwide net sales thresholds are met in connection with any pharmaceutical product containing or comprising any compound that we acquired from S*BIO for use for specific diseases, infections or other conditions. In addition, S*BIO is entitled to receive royalty payments from us at incremental rates in the low single-digits based on certain worldwide net sales thresholds on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Following FDA approval of VONJO in February 2022, a $25.0 million milestone payment was made to S*BIO during the second quarter of 2022. At our election, we may pay up to 50% of any milestone payments to S*BIO through the issuance of shares of our common stock or shares of our preferred stock automatically convertible into our common stock.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
In June 2005, we entered into an acquisition agreement with Cephalon, Inc., or Cephalon, pursuant to which we divested the compound, TRISENOX. Cephalon was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva. Under this agreement, we have the right to receive up to $100 million in payments upon achievement by Teva of specified sales and 
development milestones related to TRISENOX. To date, we have received $60.0 million of such potential milestone payments as a result of Teva having achieved certain sales milestones. The achievement of the remaining milestones is uncertain at this time. 
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the United States and foreign countries directed to pacritinib and other product candidates. Patent coverage for our individual products extends for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where we have obtained patent protection.
Our U.S. and foreign composition of matter patents for pacritinib expire as follows: U.S. patents expire in May 2028 (method) / January 2029 (compound) / March 2030 (salt); foreign patents expire in November 2026 (method and compound) / December 2029 (salt). We expect that any patents issued from our U.S. and foreign patent applications for use of pacritinib for treating transplant rejection will expire in 2036. 
In April 2022, we filed patent term extension applications for U.S. Patent No. 8,153,632, which includes claims covering pacritinib and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and for U.S. Patent No. 9,573,964, which includes claims covering methods of treating certain proliferative diseases, such as myelofibrosis. For U.S. Patent No. 8,153,632, we requested five years of extension, which, if granted, would extend the expiration date of that patent from January 2029 to January 2034. For U.S. Patent No. 9,573,964, we requested 1,085 days of extension, which, if granted, would extend the expiration date of that patent from May 2028 to April 2031. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, can often take several years to respond to patent term extension applications. If the USPTO determines that both applications are eligible for extension of patent term, we will be required to elect which of these two patents will receive the requested extension of term. We will be required to make this election after we receive notice that the applications are eligible. If we fail to make an election, the USPTO will apply the extension to U.S. Patent No. 8,153,632, the longer of the two extension requests. 
Each patent in our portfolio may be eligible for patent term restoration of up to five years under certain circumstances. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data may be complementary to patent protection. During a period of regulatory exclusivity, competitors generally may not use the original applicant’s data as the basis for a generic application. In the United States, the data protection generally runs for five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, which period is extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication. Pacritinib has orphan drug designation for myelofibrosis in the United States and the European Union, or EU. 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants drug exclusivity to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and manufacturing the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation entitles an applicant to grant funding applied towards clinical studies, tax incentives, and waivers of FDA user fees. 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. On February 7, 2023, VONJO was granted seven years of orphan-drug exclusive approval by the FDA for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis (MF) with a platelet count below 50 x109/L, pursuant to section 527 of the FDCA. The seven-year exclusive approval began on February 28, 2022. 
The FDA’s interpretation of the scope of orphan drug exclusivity may change. The FDA’s longstanding interpretation of the Orphan Drug Act is that exclusivity is specific to the orphan indication for which the drug was actually approved. As a result, the scope of exclusivity has been narrow and protected only against competition from the same “use or indication” rather than the broader “disease or condition.” In the September 2021 case Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA, a federal circuit court suggested orphan drug exclusivity covers the full scope of the orphan-designated disease or condition regardless of whether a drug obtains approval only for a narrower use. Depending on how this decision is applied beyond this case, it may be used to limit the drugs that can receive exclusivity. In January 2023, the FDA published a notice that it intends to continue to interpret orphan drug exclusivity based on its longstanding practice, rather than the federal court interpretation. 
In addition to our patent rights, we rely, to the extent possible, on trade secrets and contractual protections for our know-how and other unpatented technology. Ultimately, to the extent any of our product candidates are not protected by patent rights, our competitors would be free to use inventions embodied in our product candidates to which they have access to compete with us.
The risks and uncertainties associated with our intellectual property, including our patents, are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Manufacturing, Distribution and Associated Operations
Our manufacturing strategy utilizes third-party contractors for the procurement and manufacture, as applicable, of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, as well as for labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations. As a result of the February 2022 FDA approval of VONJO and the continued expansion of our clinical development activities, we expect that our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements will continue to increase correspondingly. The development and commercialization of a major product candidate like pacritinib without a collaborative partner has significantly increased our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements, and we expect such increases to continue as we advance the clinical development of pacritinib.
Each third-party contractor undergoes a formal qualification process by our subject matter experts prior to our entry into any service agreement and initiating any manufacturing work. We currently have a commercial supply arrangement for pacritinib.
Integral to our manufacturing strategy is our quality control and quality assurance program, which includes standard operating procedures and specifications with the goal that our compounds are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and other applicable global regulations. The cGMP compliance includes strict adherence to regulations for quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities for products and product candidates must meet cGMP requirements, and commercialized products must have acquired FDA, EMA and any other applicable regulatory approval. In this regard, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our compounds in accordance with cGMPs for use in clinical trials and distribution.
We believe our operational strategy of utilizing qualified outside vendors in the foregoing manner allows us to direct our financial and managerial resources to development and commercialization activities, rather than to the establishment and maintenance of a manufacturing and distribution infrastructure.
Competition 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face competition from a variety of companies focused on developing oncology drugs. We compete with large pharmaceutical companies and with other specialized biotechnology companies. In addition to the specific competitive factors discussed below, new anti-cancer drugs that may be developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.
VONJO faces competition from the currently-approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, Jakafi® / Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) and Inrebic® (fedratinib) as well as BESREMi® (ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft). In August 2019, Celgene (which was subsequently acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb) announced FDA approval of Inrebic® for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis, and in February 2021 Bristol Myers Squibb announced the European Commission, or EC, approval of Inrebic®. In November 2021, PharmaEssentia announced FDA approval of BESREMi® for the treatment of adults with polycythemia vera. VONJO may also face competition from momelotinib, which Sierra Oncology acquired from Gilead. In June 2019, Sierra Oncology announced that momelotinib was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA and launched a Phase 3 clinical trial in November 2019. In June 2021, Sierra Oncology announced that the Phase 3 trial enrollment was completed and in January 2022, announced top-line data from the Phase 3 trial. In June 2022, Sierra Oncology announced that an NDA was submitted to the FDA for momelotinib. Sierra Oncology was acquired by GSK plc, or GSK, in July 2022. In August 2022, GSK announced that the NDA was accepted by the FDA and that the FDA assigned a PDUFA action date of June 16, 2023.
Some of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology 
companies. Many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs.
Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as our products and if the approved indications are similar. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us. In some instances, such products have already entered late-stage clinical trials or received FDA or EC approval. However, cancer drugs with distinctly different mechanisms of action are often used together in combination for treating cancer, allowing several different products to target the same cancer indication or disease type. Such combination therapy is typically supported by clinical trials that demonstrate the advantage of combination therapy over that of a single-agent treatment.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain scientific personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products, either alone or through outside parties. We will continue to seek licenses with respect to technology related to our field of interest and may face competition with respect to such efforts. See the risk factor, “We face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to competition in our industry. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The FDCA and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. In addition to FDA regulation, we are also subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way through the EMA and the EC, but country-specific regulation by the competent authorities of the EU Member States remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, including through review and approval of NDAs. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant. There are also additional laws and regulations, administered by the FDA and other government agencies, that are applicable to the development, approval, manufacture, marketing, promotion, sale, pricing and distribution of drugs.
Drug Development
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application. Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND application, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND application becomes effective 30 calendar days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. 
Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND application. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND application may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
A study sponsor is required to submit certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results to the National Institutes of Health for public posting on http://clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:
•Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
•Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product, at the proposed dosing regimen.
The sponsoring company, the FDA or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
The FDA and IND application sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA application. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. These agreements may not be changed after the clinical trials begin, except in limited circumstances. The existence of a SPA, however, does not assure approval of a product candidate. For additional information relating to drug development, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Drug Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the investigational product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial review user fee to the FDA. The FDA will review the application and may deem it to be inadequate to support commercial marketing, and there can be no assurance that any product approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also seek the advice of an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians practicing in the field for which the product is intended, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee. Companies are not permitted to market drugs in the United States until receiving approval of an NDA or BLA from the FDA.
The FDA has various programs, including Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities where the product is manufactured, tested and distributed and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, or impose other post-approval commitment conditions.

In some circumstances, post-marketing testing may include post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are used primarily to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended population, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In addition, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. A REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk mitigation tools.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. For additional information relating to drug development, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Post-Approval FDA Requirements
Holders of an approved NDA are required to: (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing and distribution facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and distribution to maintain cGMP compliance. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing facilities that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. For additional information relating to post-approval requirements, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Advertising and Promotion
Under the FDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses, or uses not approved by the FDA. This means that in the U.S., we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the uses of our products that are not approved by the FDA, unless otherwise allowed by the FDA by policy or other guidance. Marketing of prescription drugs is also subject to additional laws and regulations through federal and state agencies tasked with consumer protection. After approval in the U.S., we must comply with these law and regulations, as well as FDA’s regulation of drug promotion and advertising, including restrictions on off-label promotion. For additional information relating to restrictions related to advertising and promotion, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
As a result of approval for VONJO in the United States, our operations and business arrangements, including with third-parties (including but not limited to researchers, healthcare professionals, consultants, payors, and customers), are subject to additional healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by federal and state governments in the United States. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such reporting obligations were expanded to include payments and other transfers of value provided in 2021 to certain other healthcare professionals.
Anti-Kickback Laws
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits companies and individuals from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or reward referrals of business that will be paid for by federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are also required to comply with other state anti-kickback statutes and other limitations on gifts and payments to physicians and reporting of payments to certain third parties, among other requirements. Failure to abide by anti-kickback statutes can result in civil and criminal enforcement actions and/or sanctions. Likewise, federal and state false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, prohibit knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false claims or false or fraudulent statements material to a false claim to government health care programs. Pharmaceutical companies are frequent targets of Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims lawsuits, which may result in treble damages, penalties, and potential exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Anti-Kickback laws, false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty statutes often overlap and may also be enforced in conjunction. For additional information relating to our obligations under health care fraud and abuse laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission jointly enforce the FCPA, and those agencies have, in recent years, emphasized FCPA enforcement against pharmaceutical companies. In some countries, we may interact with health care professionals or other officials that meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. We are subject to the FCPA’s prohibitions against unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees or agents. If we were determined to have violated the FCPA, we could be subject to substantial fines, penalties, and other legal or equitable sanctions. For additional information relating to our obligations under the FCPA and anti-bribery laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Third-Party Reimbursement
The coverage and reimbursement status of VONJO is subject to significant uncertainty. Sales of and revenue from VONJO will depend on coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including government health programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for VONJO can be subject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors. Government health programs and private insurers are increasingly trying to reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals, and any future legislative, regulatory, or contractual developments could affect the coverage and reimbursement status of VONJO. For additional information relating to product reimbursement, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Data Privacy and Protection
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and implementing regulations, create requirements relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA regulations govern the manner in which certain health information may be used and disclosed, and require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA and HITECH requirements are applicable to covered entities, which are (1) health plans, (2) health care clearinghouses, and (3) health care providers who electronically transmit certain health information. Those requirements are also applicable, in many instances, to business associates of covered entities. In some cases, depending on our business operations and contractual agreements, including through the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to HIPAA requirements. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines, penalties, damages, loss of goodwill or business opportunities, and reputational harm. There are also additional federal, state, and local privacy laws and regulations in the U.S., including new and recently enacted laws, that may apply to us now or in the future and that require that we take measures to be transparent regarding, honor rights with respect to, and protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business, including personal information, particularly personal information that is not otherwise subject to HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, took effect on January 1, 2020, and is now amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which took effect on January 1, 2023. Other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, also have enacted similar laws, which take effect in 2023. These laws require businesses collecting information about residents in those states to disclose what personal information is collected about the 
consumer, the purposes for which that personal information is used, what personal information is sold or shared for a business purpose, and to whom, and other privacy practices of the business. They also require offering and adhering to certain privacy rights, including relating to providing access to information, allowing individuals to delete information, or allowing consumers to stop selling or sharing for targeted advertising purposes such information upon request (subject to exceptions). While we do not sell or share personal information in the traditional context, depending on how we decide to use information in the future, we may need to comply with such rights. Failure to comply with the requirements of U.S. privacy laws may result in monetary fines for noncompliance, other administrative penalties, and potential private rights of action, including relating to certain data breaches. Enforcement authorities may still implement certain variations, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines; because certain of the laws are new, it is unclear how they will be enforced. For additional information relating to our obligations under data privacy laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Non-U.S. Regulation 
Before our medicinal products can be marketed outside of the United States, we must obtain requisite approval from regulatory authorities in foreign countries similar to that required in the United States. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with healthcare professionals, pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product, which would make launch of such products commercially unfeasible in such countries.
Conduct of clinical trials in the European Union
The conduct of clinical trials in the EU is governed by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014, or CTR, which entered into force on January 31, 2022. The CTR replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive), and introduced a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU.
Under the former regime, which will expire after a transition period of one or three years before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the clinical trial is to be conducted.
A more unified procedure will apply under the new CTR. A sponsor will be able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application and consult and coordinate with the other concerned EU Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned EU Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial from being conducted in such EU Member State. From January 31, 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, has become mandatory, and by January 31, 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the former Clinical Trials Directive will be governed by the new Regulation and have to be transitioned to CTIS.
During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medical Agency, or EMA, and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, but is significantly reduced for designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is not legally binding with regard to any future Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, of the product concerned.
Marketing authorization procedures in the European Union and post-marketing obligations
In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together, the European Economic Area, or EEA), after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a MA. To obtain an MA of a drug under EU regulatory systems, an applicant can submit an MAA through, amongst others, a centralized or  decentralized procedure. 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the EC that is valid for all EU Member States in the three additional EEA Member States. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMP, and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases). For medicinal products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA before May 20, 2004 and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations, or for which the grant of a MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a MA through the centralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP, established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization.
MAs have an initial duration of five years, after which the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
Similar to Accelerated Approval regulations in the United States, conditional MAs can be granted in the EU by the EC in exceptional circumstances.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the medicinal product has already received a MA) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. New chemical entities, or NCEs, approved in the EU qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity.
An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if, during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies.
Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the medicinal product if such company can complete a full MA application with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain MA of its product.
Additionally, the EMA may grant orphan drug designation similar in principle to that in the United States. Upon the grant of a marketing authorization, orphan drug designation provides up to ten years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation. When the period of orphan market exclusivity for an indication ends, the orphan drug designation for that indication expires as well. Orphan exclusivity runs in parallel with normal rules on data exclusivity and market protection. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (orphan or not) for the same or overlapping indication subject to certain requirements.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. PRIME eligibility does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that any such designation or eligibility will result in expedited review or approval.
Pricing and reimbursement in the European Union
Even if a medicinal product obtains a MA in the EU, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively, may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.
In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Protection 
The collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which came into force in May 2018, and related ilaws in individual EU Member States.
The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (processing includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data of individuals, in particular with respect to health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR includes requirements relating to the legal basis of the processing (such as consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates), the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data, the notification obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also impose additional requirements in relation to health, genetic and biometric data through their national legislation. 
The GDPR also imposes on us, as a controller, the obligation to notify without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, the supervisory authority and/or the data subject, in the event of a personal data breach, regardless of whether the processing is carried out on our or our vendors’ systems, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In addition to the disruptions to our business and impact to our reputation that any such breach of security could cause, we may be subject to regulatory fines, class actions, or other costly measures if there is a personal data breach on our or our vendors’ systems. We maintain cyber-liability insurance, however, that insurance may be insufficient to fully cover the losses associated with such a breach, including any resulting regulatory fines. Furthermore, under the GDPR, when we act as a processor, we must notify the relevant controller without undue delay after become aware of a personal data breach.
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses (punishable by uncapped fines) for organizations and, in certain cases, their directors and officers, as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the 
EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
Environmental Regulation
In connection with our research and development activities, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes and employee safety and health matters. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with applicable law and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources. See the risk factor, “We may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to the use of hazardous materials.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 128 individuals, 127 of whom were full-time. Of these employees, 25 were in research and development, 80 were in sales and marketing, and 23 were in business and administrative positions. Our employees do not have a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
