Overview
Rover exists to give pet parents an alternative to relying on friends and family, neighbors, and commercial providers for pet care. Our online marketplace for pet care aims to match pet parents with pet lovers who provide excellent pet care while earning extra income. Our simple and easy-to-use platform enables pet parents to easily discover the right pet care providers, book services, communicate with providers, as well as read and write reviews. Our platform enables pet care providers to independently set pricing, create a profile, manage bookings, communicate with pet parents, define the terms and delivery of their services, and receive payment, all in a simple and cost-effective way. As used in this section, a booking is defined as a single arrangement between a pet parent and pet care provider on the Rover platform, which can be for a single night or multiple nights for overnight services, or for a single walk/day/drop-in or multiple walks/days/drop-ins for daytime services. We discuss bookings information in more detail in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics—Bookings.”
A Place for Rover, Inc., a Delaware corporation and, after the merger described in Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business and Note 3 - Reverse Recapitalization, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Legacy Rover”), was incorporated on June 16, 2011. For a full discussion of the general development of our business and information about our legal predecessor, see “Business—Our History” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed on March 21, 2022, which section is incorporated herein by reference. During 2022, we introduced virtual dog training through the acquisition of GoodPup, an early-stage company that operates a virtual dog training platform (see Note 4 - Business Combination), and invested in an early-stage service for pet parents that is complementary to our current offerings (see Note 6 - Investments).
Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Rover,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to Rover Group, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Our Mission
We believe in the unconditional love of pets, and Rover exists to make it possible for everyone to experience this love in their lives. 
Rover breaks down the barriers to loving and trusted pet care so that more people can experience this unconditional love. As pet parents ourselves, we created a community where fellow pet parents can connect with pet care providers who will treat their pets like family. With the Rover platform, we also believe that if we make it easy for everyday pet people to start and grow their own small pet care businesses, we can do more than enable additional income for pet care providers and loving care for pets; we can unlock joy for pets, pet lovers, and pet parents everywhere. Over the years, we have discovered more: Growing Rover has revealed to us the depth and importance of the bonds we share with our pets—and the extraordinary empathy, care, and love that people in our neighborhoods can provide for their communities. Some of the best parts of being on the Rover team are the stories and anecdotes that we hear about the unique bonds between pets, pet parents, and the pet care providers who love and care for them.
The community formed on Rover is at the heart of our business. It includes ordinary neighborhood pet people who, when they step in to care for your pet, reveal themselves to be extraordinary. Our shared love of pets is powerful, inclusive, and magnetic. Pets bring people together and can even give us a sense of belonging and meaning. It is our privilege to be stewards of those connections and relationships.
Our Business
Rover is the world's largest online marketplace for pet care. According to publicly available app reviews and average ratings as of January 2023, we are the world's leading pet services app. We connect pet parents with caring pet care providers who offer overnight services, including boarding and in-home pet sitting, and daytime services, including doggy day care, dog walking, drop-in visits, and dog training. We currently operate in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. Through December 31, 2022, over 4.1 million unique pet parents and over 870,000 pet care providers across North America, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe have booked or provided a service on Rover, enabling millions of moments of joy and play for people and pets.
For pets and their parents, we believe Rover is a better pet care solution than the existing options of friends and family, neighbors, and commercial service providers. Through Rover, pet parents are able to share individualized care instructions with pet care providers so that their pets receive the best care tailored to their specific needs. Our customer service team supports both pet parents and pet care providers when they need help along the way and has helped build our commitment to trust and safety, which is foundational to our brand. We offer features to facilitate safe, informed, and positive experiences for the people and pets in our community and provide a 24/7 in-house team to support our community if a problem arises during a stay. In the rare instance a service doesn’t go as planned, we offer the Rover Guarantee reimbursement program to assist with certain out-of-pocket costs incurred by parents or pet care providers so that pets can get the care they need. The Rover Guarantee reimburses both pet parents and pet care providers up to $25,000 for costs arising from certain injuries or damages that occur during a service booked and paid through Rover and up to $1 million for costs arising from damage to pet parent property or certain third-party injuries, subject to terms and conditions thereunder. Safety has always been at the heart of what we do. Through it all, we have been guided by our love of pets and belief in the unique human-pet bond.
For pet care providers, our tools help them to easily create a listing on the Rover marketplace as well as schedule and book care, communicate with pet parents, and receive payment. The Rover marketplace allows pet parents to choose and match with pet people who want to earn extra income doing what they love: spending time with pets. We believe that these matches not only enable better care for pets, but also create joy for both parties, and through our simple and easy-to-use platform that enables pet parents to discover, book, pay and review pet care providers online or in our app we seek to radically simplify the logistics of pet care. 
We generate substantially all of our revenue from our pet care marketplace platform that connects pet parents and pet care providers. We generally collect service fees from both pet parents and pet care providers. We earn more revenue as more pet parents request and pet care providers accept and complete bookings. We also earn revenue from ancillary sources such as provider onboarding fees, virtual pet training services, affiliate fees via our blog, and sales of products in the Rover Store. We created Rover’s blog in 2014 and have scaled it to become one of the world’s largest pet blogs, reaching over 42 million unique users in 2022. 
In support of our mission, we continue to invest in our product and have completed several acquisitions since our inception to help us grow our business and serve more pet parents. We also continue to explore and test new service lines, that we may launch at future dates, and evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities.
Our Services
The figure below describes the services offered on our platform, with gross booking value, or GBV, and average price based on 2022 results. The breakdown of services by percentage of GBV for 2022 was almost identical to the breakdown for 2021. Average prices increased over 2021 levels as discussed in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Performance—Service Booking Mix.”
To find a pet care provider, pet parents can arrange a Meet & Greet with the pet care provider following contact on our platform. Once the pet parent and pet care provider accept the booking request, often following a successful Meet & Greet, the booking is confirmed. Once the service begins, the pet parents can receive regular photos and updates from the pet care provider. Following the service, pet parents have the option to review and/or tip the pet care providers, as well as book for their next stay. Often, new pet parents come to our platform ahead of a planned trip to utilize overnight services, and once they experience the ease that Rover provides, they expand to daytime services as well. We introduced features in the U.S. and Canada that enable the booking of recurring daytime services in 2019 to allow pet parents and pet care providers to set a regular schedule for their services, and in 2021, introduced extended stay billing features that allow pet care providers to charge based on service pick-up and drop-off times.
Seasonality
Our bookings are impacted by seasonal trends. Over the course of the year, we historically experience seasonally high bookings during the third quarter, which then step down slightly during the fourth quarter, and then stay approximately flat during the first quarter before ramping again in the second quarter. We usually experience stronger bookings, particularly for overnight boarding and house sitting services, during the months of June, July, and August, and November and December, which in a typical year coincides with high travel demand related to summer and holiday travel, respectively. This seasonality impacts bookings, GBV, revenue, marketing, and service operations expenses. Bookings can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events.
Our Marketplace Creation Strategy
To create this market for pet services, which requires both local network effects and platform network effects, we have developed a local marketplace strategy. In particular, by facilitating successful pet care relationships, demonstrated by the fact that 97% of our reviewed stays have a 5-star rating from inception through December 31, 2022, we drive word-of-mouth growth at the local marketplace level. This drives our brand in combination with efforts such as content marketing and our leading blog for pet lovers.
•New pet parents and pet care providers join Rover organically. Pet parents and pet care providers from neighborhoods covering over 98% of the United States population have signed up with Rover, based on the US Census zip code tabulation areas with booked transactions on the platform as of December 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2022, 42% of new pet parents came to us through word-of-mouth across all our markets. In our largest markets, 52% of new pet parents came to us through word-of-mouth. In addition to paid marketing, we complement word-of-mouth momentum with content to drive awareness of Rover with more pet lovers. Rover’s blog has become one of the world’s largest pet blogs and is available in the local language of all the countries where we operate.
•Our matching algorithm increases customer satisfaction, growing the marketplace. Unlike marketplaces that invest primarily in acquisition marketing to create a flywheel of growing demand and supply, Rover’s matching algorithm is the key to our marketplace creation strategy. Facilitating great matches between pet, parent, and provider is the most important thing we do. Rover engineers, data scientists, and statisticians develop, maintain, and update our algorithms. We use reviews, proximity, browsing, contact, and booking data to predict which pet care providers are most likely to be great matches when pet parents search for providers in our marketplace. The stages of the continued improvement in our matching algorithm are:
◦More bookings lead to more data. With more bookings across a growing pet parent base, we increase the density and diversity of our data from marketplace geographies, adding to our data science asset and improving our ability to facilitate better matches through machine learning.
◦More data leads to better matches. As activity on our platform grows, we build better data density in a geography over time. This leads to better matches. As the data density of pet parents and pet care providers increases in a given geography, pet parents are likely to find the best provider to match their specific needs and in closer proximity. We monitor over a hundred attributes of a booking, including proximity, responsiveness, and likelihood to rebook.
◦Better matches lead to more bookings. Our proprietary Rover algorithm learns to present pet care providers who are most likely to be a good match for a booking, and who are more likely to respond, increasing the likelihood that a pet parent's search turns into a booking.
•Repeat bookings increase, driving brand awareness and word-of-mouth attraction of more pet parents and pet care providers. As pets and parents have better and better experiences on Rover, they are increasingly more likely to rebook services or try additional service offerings. Increases in loyalty from pet parents also increase word-of-mouth marketing to other pet parents, who then join the platform. These pet parents in turn create even more information that Rover can use to make the experiences of other pets, parents, and pet care providers even better in the future, creating a virtuous cycle. Our brand sits at the nexus of trust and love, and our brand strategy is to earn our place in pet parents’ “circle of trust” for pet care. We do this by establishing Rover as an extension and improvement upon pet care provided by friends and family.
In these ways, improvements in our matching algorithm have compounding, accelerating effects on the ability of our marketplace to scale, which we then leverage to build greater and greater momentum, as illustrated by the figure below.
We complement our organic growth with paid customer acquisition. Our algorithm improves paid marketing efficiency as a local marketplace grows. Once our matching algorithms have enough data to increase our conversion rate and rebooking rate in a market, we accelerate investment in paid customer acquisition. We use predictive analytics to invest in marketing utilizing a marginal cost framework that often results in a one to two-quarter payback period, inclusive of variable costs. Our matching algorithm is a key element of our ability to acquire customers with a high degree of efficiency.
Our Competitive Strengths
As we grow our online pet care marketplace, our competitive strengths relative to other online platforms include:
•Largest number of high-quality pet care providers. Pet care providers are attracted to the Rover platform. As pet parents conduct more transactions on the platform, they create additional booking opportunities for pet care providers. Additional bookings enable pet care providers to make more money and to manage their listings so that the matches they receive are even more targeted to their own preferences. For example, a pet care provider who desires to book only with Husky dogs may find herself able to do that over time as she amasses sufficient reviews and repeat customers, and as the Husky bookings increase. This ability to precisely satisfy the unique preferences of pet care providers is very difficult to replicate and translates to enormous provider satisfaction and advocacy. Pet care providers come to our platform organically and stay with it. For example, once a provider has had a booking on the platform, we find that over 65% of them will receive three or more bookings in their first 12 months on the platform. For those in this group, providers experience above 95% repeat revenue retention on a year-over-year basis.
•Rover algorithm and data scale to make better matches. The scale and breadth of Rover’s pet care provider network, coupled with the evolution of our algorithm, enables us to continuously improve matches on our platform. Instead of just investing in marketing to grow our marketplace, we have focused on matching the needs and preferences of each individual pet parent to the best pet care provider.
•Multiple network effects. According to publicly available app reviews and user counts as of January 2023, we are the world’s largest online marketplace for pet care services. With our leading scale, we can offer pet parents and pet care providers the benefits of density and diversity in a local marketplace. Pet parents searching for care on Rover can often find providers who live in their neighborhoods, or even—in the case of people in large cities—in their own apartment buildings. They can also find pet care providers who offer a broad diversity of environments, services, availability, capabilities, and price points to meet the unique needs of their pets. Many of these providers will also have dozens, if not hundreds, of reviews and repeat customers. This combination of density, diversity, and quality results in better matches and more positive experiences on our marketplace.
•Strong pet parent loyalty and word-of-mouth growth. In 2022, 1.6 million unique pet parents had a booking on our platform. We define pet parent cohorts by the period in which pet parents first booked on our platform. Of our January 2022 cohort, 60% of new pet parents on Rover rebooked within the first 12 months. Our continuous excellence in facilitating initial matches between pet, parent, and provider translates directly into advantages in our ability to retain pet parents and match them with providers who offer other types of services as well. For example, a new pet parent who books a drop-in visit as a first service on Rover may translate her delight into trials of doggy day care, or dog walking. The number of bookings per repeat customer has grown from 3.7 in year 1 for our January 2013 cohort, to 6.2 in year 1 for our January 2022 cohort.
•The #1 pet services app. We are the world's leading pet services app. The Rover mobile app offers a seamless, all-inclusive experience. Pet parents are able to discover pet care providers, read their profiles, reviews, and other attributes such as repeat client counts, communicate with providers, and book services. Pet care providers are able to create personalized profiles, set pricing, manage bookings, communicate with pet parents, send photos and updates, as well as receive payment. Based on the number of iOS and Android reviews and average ratings as of January 2023, Rover remains the top pet services mobile app.
•Top Tier trust and safety support designed for pet care. Our platform provides trust and safety support to both pet parents and providers through a dedicated team of trust and safety agents that assist pet parents and pet care providers with everything from emergency vet visits to questions about pet behavior. Throughout our history, Rover has invested in empathetic and knowledgeable care for our community.
Our Long-Term Growth Strategy
We aim to build a global brand that stands for excellence in pet care through the pursuit of the following strategies. These individual vectors accelerate each other by driving the entire marketplace with additional cross-sell opportunities and brand and data synergies.
•Attract and delight customers in existing geographies and within existing services. We believe that considerable growth remains within our existing service offerings and geographies. Our cumulative customer volumes represent a tiny fraction of this potential. From inception through December 31, 2022, over four million unique pet parents had booked a service on Rover, which represents approximately 3% of the estimated 137 million pet households in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe. By continuing to enhance our platform, we make it fast and easy to find a trusted pet care provider in your neighborhood.
•Expand service offerings and pets covered. We plan to continue introducing additional service offerings in the Rover marketplace, further delighting pets, parents, and providers and driving significant revenue growth. For example, in late 2015 we introduced dog walking, drop-in visits, and doggy day care as complements to dog boarding and house sitting. In the year ended December 31, 2022, those services had expanded to approximately 30% of total GBV. In 2022, we introduced virtual dog training through the acquisition of GoodPup, an early-stage company that operates a virtual dog training platform.We launched Rover with pet services for dogs and found that pet lovers use Rover to arrange care for pets of all types. In 2018, we modified our applications to better support the needs of cat parents on the platform. In the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 15% of our bookings were for cats, up from 13% in the prior year period. To further delight pet care providers and pet parents, we expect to continue enhancing our cat offering.
•Increase international coverage. We aim to serve pet parents and pet care providers around the world. In the near term, our focus is continued expansion within our existing footprint. While we believe that our current footprint 
represents the largest opportunity in Western Europe, we also believe that Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and Poland are attractive markets that could offer meaningful expansion to our existing European business. We continue to evaluate options to expand directly or via acquisitions to supplement our organic growth and operating leverage. Over the longer term, we may expand into additional attractive geographies.
•Grow advertising and retail offerings. We plan to leverage our brand to expand revenue from non-service offerings. We offer the Rover blog and Rover Store to make life easier and more joyful for pet parents and pet care providers. As part of our blog, Rover pet care experts and writers craft customer-centric product reviews, recommendations, and information, which have become a trusted source on all things pet-related. Over time, we entered into affiliate relationships with select retail and other partners to monetize our content operation. Our second initiative to leverage our brand to make life easier for pet parents is the Rover Store, which offers products that strengthen bonds between people and the pets in their lives. The Rover Store celebrates unique human-pet relationships with curated and high-quality third-party merchandise alongside bespoke Rover-branded merchandise and materials for pet care providers to grow their pet care businesses on Rover. Our third initiative is the launching of Rover Gear, our first line of dog walking products and everyday essentials for pet parents. Beginning in early March 2023, Rover Gear became available via the Rover Store and Amazon Marketplace.
•Expand strategic partnerships. We believe that, over time, we can extend the value of Rover with strategic partnerships in the pet industry and others, including travel, hospitality, and omnichannel retail. The first category of collaborations is with pet and travel partners; for example, we currently have programs with Petco and Walmart. The second category is focused on distributing access to services via Rover as an employee benefit; for example, we have a distribution partnership with Bright Horizons. These mutually beneficial partnerships can enable efficient growth by connecting Rover to new audiences of highly-qualified prospective customers: pet parents interested in travel, leading busy lives, and actively shopping for products they and their pets will love. By introducing Rover to these audiences through brands they know and trust, we can target our awareness-building efforts and connect more pet parents with quality, local pet care providers.
Our Foundation of Trust and Safety
Rover was founded in reverence for the unique bond between each pet and parent, so no pet, pet parent, pet care provider, or safety incident is a mere statistic. Building safety into every booking is core at Rover, and we are committed to promoting safe stays. For the rare instance when something doesn’t go as planned, we’ve built an experienced team to assist pet parents and pet care providers alike. We have built safety features into our platform which we believe, taken together, are unparalleled in comparison to other pet care options. This is made possible by a number of investments we have made to bring peace of mind to pet parents.
•Specialized support. As a commitment to the safety of pets and people using the marketplace, our Trust & Safety support line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week in the United States and Canada for any questions or concerns. In the United Kingdom and Western Europe, English-language trust and safety support is also available 24/7, and additional language support is available 9:00 am to 6:00 pm in the United Kingdom, and 10:00 am to 7:00 pm in Western European markets. Pet care providers also have 24/7 access to advice from qualified veterinary professionals in case of emergencies.
•Watchlist and background checks. All new pet care providers on our platform in the United States and Canada pass third-party background checks in order to offer their services on Rover. In the United States, pet care providers are checked against national criminal offense databases, sex offender registries, and certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watchlists. As of December 31, 2022, 100% of providers in North America who serviced a booking in 2022 had passed a standard background check, with over half passing an additional, enhanced background check. These enhanced checks are more comprehensive and include a manual search of county-level databases. Starting early in the first quarter of 2022, any pet care provider in North America who creates a new profile is required to complete an enhanced background check. In the United Kingdom and Western Europe, we use a third party to conduct identity verification on all pet care providers. All pet care provider profiles are also subject to review and approval by our team of pet care provider specialists.
•Strong community guidelines. We move quickly to address behaviors that are not consistent with our community guidelines. We regularly remove both pet parents and pet care providers from our platform if they behave in ways that violate our Terms of Service. In doing so, we aim to preserve the integrity of our platform and keep Rover safe for pets, parents, and providers.
•Detailed - and personalized - pet care provider profiles. All pet care providers on our platform provide a detailed profile and personal information such as name, profile picture, location, and pet care experience, among other information. Pet care providers are able to specify what types of pets they are most comfortable with (dog/cat, size, age, breed, etc.), so that pet parents can find a provider that matches the unique needs of their pet. Rover also recommends that providers and pet parents have a meet and greet prior to first booking as an extra assurance that all parties are aligned and comfortable with the match. We offer a detailed meet and greet checklist that can help as a guide on what types of information to cover in this meeting, so that the stay is set up for success.
•Verified customer reviews. From inception through December 31, 2022, our pet parents had written more than 6.8 million cumulative reviews, and 97% of our reviewed bookings had a 5-star rating. Pet parents can also see how many of the clients a sitter has booked through Rover have come back to book with them again. In addition, after a booking is complete, pet care providers can write reviews of the pets and respond publicly to the pet parents’ reviews of themselves.
•Personal information privacy. Pet parents and pet care providers can communicate through the Rover platform without sharing their personal information using an in-product messaging platform, or via a Rover-generated phone number. Payment exchanges are secured through the Rover platform when the booking is made to ensure pet care providers are paid once the services are provided.
•Safety information sharing. We continually improve our platform to put pet safety at the forefront. Utilizing the wealth of safety information available on the Rover blog, we provide safety tips and reminders to our pet care providers when it’s most relevant. We proactively share information with pet care providers through multiple channels, including in-app messaging, SMS text, and email notifications. For example, during the summer months, we have provided high-heat risk alerts to providers caring for breeds that are susceptible to heat-related medical conditions.
Operations and Support
Our operations and support team assists pet parents and pet care providers with items such as changes to existing bookings, questions concerning the completion of a booking, addressing safety issues such as illness or other complications, and the initial quality review of pet care provider profiles. Rover also offers a Reservation Protection policy through which we can provide financial assistance if a pet care provider cancels last minute. We are proud of our success in providing excellent support to both pet parents and providers. 
We partner with business process outsourcing providers to handle most of our standard customer service-related requests, while more sensitive and complex issues are handled by our in-house teams located in Seattle, WA, Spokane, WA, and San Antonio, TX.
In Europe, our service-related contacts, via voice, chat, and email, are handled both by employees located in Barcelona and our business process outsourcing partners. Rover employees in Barcelona are trained to handle both routine and escalated contacts. We offer local language support for all the countries in which we operate, with the hours of operation for this support varying by language.
Our Development and Technology Infrastructure
Our technology vision is to build and deliver secure, flexible, scalable systems, tools, and products that exceed our customers’ expectations, accelerate growth, and improve productivity. Our guiding principle is to aim for a technology architecture that is modularized along natural domain boundaries emerging from how our business works.
We built our marketplace to constantly improve its ability to match unique pets with unique pet care providers as the business scales. Our proprietary matching and booking platform connects to the frontend customer web and mobile clients, as well as to our support operations team and our data science platform. We collect and secure information generated from customer activity and use machine learning to continuously improve our matching algorithm. Our platform allows us to seamlessly internationalize our product, integrate images and videos, use experiments to optimize customer experience and test product improvements in real-time, monitor our site reliability, and rapidly respond to incidents. Finally, our matching and booking platform connects to leading third-party vendors for communications, payment processing, operations and support, as well as background checks and identity verifications.
We have a research and development culture that rapidly and consistently delivers high-quality products and enhancements to the performance, functionality, and usability of our platform. As of December 31, 2022, we have assembled a team of 128 highly skilled technical leaders, engineers, designers, and computer and data scientists whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas. We organize our team with product development, platform engineering, data engineering and analytics, cloud engineering solutions, and information security. We focus on customer experience, quality, consistency, reliability, and efficiency when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and offered to customers on the platform of their choice. We follow agile methodology, frequently update our software products, and have a regular software release schedule. Our products and systems are built on secure and scalable technology platforms and services that enable us to deliver customer-centric products and services on scalable infrastructure able to serve peaks in demand.
We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of this relationship, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Privacy and Technology—We primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.”
We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Full disk snapshots of the database are performed daily, and databases can be restored to any point in time within the retention period using our database services’ point-in-time recovery features. In addition, as a default, redundant copies of content are stored independently in at least two separate geographic regions and replicated reliably within each region. We are investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy, data protection, and security foundations. We are also continually implementing, reviewing, and updating our related policies and practices.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy primarily consists of acquisition marketing, brand marketing, lifecycle marketing, content publishing, and public relations.
We manage our digital demand acquisition marketing at a local level. In the earlier stages of maturity within a specific geography, we use acquisition marketing to complement organic growth and increase information for our algorithm. As a specific geographic marketplace matures, we see the proportion of new bookings driven by word-of-mouth increase. Once a local marketplace is more mature, we accelerate acquisition marketing with a faster payback period and higher expected lifetime value for a new pet parent. Marketing spend, inclusive of headcount, represented 82% of revenue in 2018, 53% in 2019, 33% in 2020, 18% in 2021, and 21% in 2022 for the years ended December 31.
Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, we embraced 2020 and 2021 as an opportunity to make meaningful improvements to our marketing platform and measurement approaches. Here, our goal was to make investments that would improve the efficiency of our paid marketing in years 2022 and beyond. We also made significant investments to improve our organic search rankings in response to Google’s algorithm changes, although subsequent Google updates have rolled back some of these improvements. We combined these improvements with a near-total reduction in spending on video and social channels that made less sense to run during the pandemic. As we entered 2022, we intentionally increased our marketing spend to support our new customer acquisition initiatives, including in our international markets. In the year ended December 31, 2021, 38% of new bookings came from paid channels, while in the year ended December 31, 2022, 45% of new bookings came from paid channels. For additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of COVID-19 and Other Health Trends.”
Our brand marketing strategy consists primarily of word-of-mouth, social media, and the Rover blog, which help us earn a place in pet parents’ “circle of trust” for pet care. We do this by establishing Rover as an extension of, and improvement upon, the pet care provided by friends and family: a caring, trustworthy, reliable option that becomes the go-to solution.
Rover’s blog reached over 42 million unique users in 2022, making it one of the world’s largest pet blogs. In addition to driving awareness of Rover to prospective customers, the Rover blog helps us to constantly reinforce our brand with pet parents and pet care providers who are currently on the platform. Historically, our content has focused on helpful, instructional articles designed to make it easier for people to have pets in their lives, spotlighting relevant stories that celebrate the joy of pets.
Human Capital
Our People
Amazing people come to work at Rover because they hear about our culture. Our leadership team is committed to building and sustaining a culture that challenges people to be the best contributors to the business that they can be, but also welcomes and values them as human beings with everyday struggles that show up in the workplace. As a result, we have built a team of results-oriented and data-first professionals who are also collegial, personable, and genuinely nice to be around. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 501 employees, of which 413 were based in the United States and 88 were based outside of the United States. This headcount represents an approximately 35% year-over-year increase as our business continued to grow, and includes 128 product development employees, 41 marketing employees, 242 operations and support employees, and 90 general and administrative employees. In the second half of 2022, we adopted a policy empowering department heads to determine the in-office and remote work requirements for their teams. While some of our employees work remotely full-time, during the days when employees are together in person in one of our offices in Seattle, WA, Spokane, WA, San Antonio, TX, and Barcelona, Spain, they work in a collaborative, fun, and engaging environment with their four-legged friends. We also engage contractors and consultants.
Our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our Culture
Our approach for building culture is explicit. “Culture” can be defined as “the quality in a person or society that arises from a concern for what is regarded as excellent.” We subscribe strongly to this idea and have established company values that define and reinforce a culture of excellence at Rover. These values are not simply words on paper; they are statements that we take seriously and that we reinforce regularly during our interview process, in our employee review and development process, in our consideration of internal promotions, and in regular company presentations. These values are tied directly to specific, unique-to-Rover behaviors that we encourage, and others that we do not. They are worth stating here in their entirety:
•Commitment to our community. We do our very best, every day, to serve the needs of pet care providers, parents, and their pets, so they feel a part of our community. Their safety and well-being are a top priority.
•No office politics. We lean into the hard stuff, own our decisions, and prioritize business goals over short-term career interests. We have respect for transparency and reverence for vulnerability, and we tell it how it is—including about ourselves.
•Intentional balance of pace and precision. We rely on data and analysis to drive decisions, and we’re deliberate about balancing speed with the risk of error. And when it’s time to go fast, we move. We’re not intimidated by failure, accepting occasional errors of action as evidence of momentum.
•Focus on impact. We don’t waste time and we don’t waste money. We value results, not just insights or effort.
•Discipline in the way we debate. We get the right people involved in key conversations. When we spot a problem, we propose a solution. We believe that the best business outcomes come from a diverse set of perspectives. And when the decision owner makes a call, we lock arms to support its success.
•Devotion to each other as people. We’re driven by seeing our people succeed and grow. Families and life events come first, and we make space for fun and celebration. We’re committed to building a culture of inclusivity and diversity and ensuring everyone contributes to their fullest potential.
•Relentless pursuit of inspiring outcomes. We’re determined to do our jobs better than they’ve ever been done, and we inspire each other by pushing past our own perceived limitations—with the full knowledge that doing so will be uncomfortable.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Rover, our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the unconditional love of a pet, and we’re guided by that commitment throughout our work, including our recruiting and workforce development practices. 
We believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive team enhances our ability to serve our community and grow our business. We’re building that team by implementing best practices and providing resources and education to support every employee and leader in creating an environment that appreciates, respects, and empowers diverse perspectives. 
We actively recruit, retain, and develop great minds from diverse backgrounds to join our company by creating a culture where differing perspectives and experiences are not only welcomed but encouraged, and all our colleagues are treated with respect. 
Recruitment
Competition for talent has historically been intense, particularly for engineers and in the United States and Seattle, Washington, where our headquarters are located, and has only increased with the proliferation of work-from-anywhere policies that enable employees to seek out jobs that were previously not accessible. As a result, we have experienced increased costs associated with attracting and retaining our employees, especially since becoming a public company and as the business has grown over the past two years. However, we believe we offer something different: An opportunity to make it possible for everyone to experience the unconditional love of pets in their lives. We work diligently to attract talent from a diverse range of sources to grow our business and achieve our long-term strategic goals. We believe that we offer a dynamic culture where employees feel included and empowered to do their best work with opportunities to grow as well as competitive compensation and benefits.
Development and Engagement
We continue to prioritize and invest in creating opportunities for employees to grow and build their careers through training and development programs. These include offering tailored learning opportunities to enable employees to upskill while at work and driving regular career conversations between employees and their managers, as well as executive talent and succession planning.
We conduct biannual anonymous surveys to measure employee engagement and seek employee feedback on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, speed of decision making, manager feedback, career growth opportunities and other ways to improve our position as an employer of choice. The results are shared with employees and are reviewed by senior leadership to identify areas of progress or opportunity and to help prioritize responsive actions to meet employee needs, align with Rover’s core values, and enhance employee and company success. 
We take great pride in recognizing employees who embody our values, drive results, and have tenure with us. On a quarterly basis, we spotlight a different Rover core value and reward one employee as a values champion. We also recognize quarterly one hard working team that made a measurable business impact. We have a tradition of providing special recognition for those employees with five years of service at our quarterly company-wide meetings.
Total Rewards
To attract and retain top talent, we have offered and believe we will need to continue to offer competitive compensation and benefits packages, including by keeping pace with substantial market increases and inflation over recent years. Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in our future. In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer compensation and benefits programs (which vary by country/region) such as medical, dental, and vision insurance, on-demand primary care, prescription drug benefits, an employee assistance program, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees with a matching contribution, health savings account, basic term life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, paid parental leave, annual paid time off, paid sabbatical after achieving the required years of service, and commuter benefits. We also offer employees numerous pet benefits, including pet PTO (employees receive free Rover services which they can utilize when they travel), reimbursement for pet adoption/foster expenses, and paid pet bereavement leave. Employees also receive equity in the form of restricted stock units at the time of hire and through annual refresh grants. These equity grants vest over time to retain employees, foster a strong sense of ownership and engage our employees in our long-term success while also aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.
We design our employee benefits programs to be competitive in relation to the market. We adjust our employee benefits programs as needed based on market insights from third-party experts and data. In structuring our benefit programs, we seek to provide an aggregate level of benefits that are comparable to those provided by similar companies in each of our various labor markets. 
Employee Safety and Wellness
We have taken action to promote the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, we quickly transitioned the vast majority of our employees to work remotely. To support the abrupt shift to a remote working environment, we granted employees a monthly allowance that could be used to cover certain expenses related to health, wellness, and productivity. We also launched mental health and telemedicine benefits to support our employees’ well-being. Subsequently, we enabled voluntary office access and implemented safety standards based on guidance from public health authorities.
Beyond COVID-19 measures and other health insurance benefits, we offer employees on-demand, app-based mental health and emotional support solutions.
Ethical Business Practices 
We promote high standards of ethics and compliance for our business, including policies that set forth principles to guide employees, executives, and directors, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We maintain a whistleblower policy and an anonymous hotline and web portal for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy or legal violations or concerns about any situation that does not reflect our culture and values.
Competition
Our customers consist of pet parents and pet care providers, and we compete to attract and retain both pet parents and pet care providers on the basis of commitment to safety, personalized care, customer service, brand appeal, and the usefulness and convenience of our platform. We also compete, with respect to pet parents, on quality, affordability and variety of offerings, and, with respect to pet care providers, on the ability to generate income.
The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented. We face multiple competitors across different categories, and our competitors vary in both size and breadth of services. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages, as well as new entrants into the market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. Our main competitors include:
•Friends, family, and neighbors. Our largest competitive dynamic remains the people to whom pet parents go for pet care within their personal networks.
•Local independent operators. Local mom and pop shops and independent professionals often operate at a small scale with little to no online presence, primarily relying on word-of-mouth and marketing solutions such as flyers and local ads. As a pet parent, it is difficult to know where to find reliable information, who to call, and who to trust.
•Large commercial providers. Large commercial providers, such as kennels and daycares, often struggle to meet the individual needs of pet parents and their pets. Such providers can be expensive, and their facilities are often crowded, inducing stress in some pets and leading pet parents to question the quality of care their pets receive.
•Online aggregators and directories. Pet parents can also access general purpose online aggregators and directories, such as Craigslist, Nextdoor, or Yelp, to find pet care providers. However, pet parents may lack trust in these directories, or find it difficult to find an available and qualified pet care provider that suits their lifestyle, budget, and unique pet care needs.
•Other digital marketplaces. We compete with services such as Wag, the next largest online marketplace for pet care, and the pet care offering on Care.com in the United States, and small operators such as Gudog in Europe and Pawshake in Europe and Canada. We differentiate ourselves with our pure play and scaled offering.
We believe that we compete effectively against each of these competitors given our scale, brand, trust, service, convenience, data, quality of care, affordability, and ability of pet care providers to generate income. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The business and industry in which we participate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.”
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property, assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our key brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2022, we held eight registered trademarks in the United States and 22 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.rover.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Data Privacy, Data Protection and Security
We are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of our customers and our employees, and as such, we place an emphasis on data privacy, data protection and security. Our privacy and information security program is designed and implemented, both within our internal systems and on our platform, in an effort to address the security and compliance requirements of personal or otherwise sensitive or confidential data related to pet parents, pet care providers, and our employees.
We have a dedicated team of professionals that focuses on technical measures such as application, network, and system security, as well as policy measures related to privacy compliance, internal training and education, and documented incident response protocols. We maintain a documented information security program that includes periodic scans designed to identify security vulnerabilities on our servers, workstations, network equipment, production environment, and applications, and provides for subsequent remediation of any discovered vulnerabilities according to severity. We also conduct regular penetration tests and remediate according to severity for any vulnerabilities found.
We encrypt sensitive and proprietary information, as well as the personal information of our customers and our employees, both in transit (using secure transport layer security cryptographic protocols) and at rest. We use multi-factor authentication, permissioning software, audit logs, and other security controls to control access to internal systems that contain personal or other confidential information.
We design and implement our platform, offerings, and policies with a goal of facilitating compliance with evolving privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations and demonstrate respect for the privacy and data protection rights of our customers and employees. We publish our customer-related privacy practices on our website, and we maintain certain additional internal policies and practices relating to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information. We maintain a process for responding to requests made by law enforcement or government authorities for the personal information of our customers, and in connection with that process, we generally require a subpoena, court order or similar legal process prior to providing such personal information.
Publication of our privacy statement and other policies and notices regarding privacy, data protection and data security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if those statements, notices or policies are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection, or data security. 
The laws and regulations to which we are subject relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, are evolving and we expect them to continue to change over time. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or the CPRA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide specified disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing 
those requirements. Guidance related to the CCPA and CPRA continues to evolve. In addition, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or VCDPA, which took effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act, passed on June 8, 2021, will take effect on July 1, 2023. Both laws emulate the CCPA and the CPRA in many respects, but each law includes its own unique compliance requirements. Other privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we may be subject include, for example, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the EU ePrivacy Directive, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 
More generally, the various legal obligations that apply to us relating to privacy and data security may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our mobile applications or website. We may need to take additional measures to comply with new and evolving legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to reduce information security incidents or avoid breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Privacy and Technology—Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, and standards in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, pricing, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, animal and human health and safety, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, product liability, environmental protection, taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, e-commerce, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. These laws, regulations, and standards are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity or unclear applicability, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to comply with these laws or regulations in a cost-effective manner, we may need to modify impacted services and our platform, which could require a substantial investment and loss of revenue, or cease providing the impacted service altogether. If we are found to have violated laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties, and other losses. 
National, state and local governmental authorities have enacted or pursued, and may in the future enact and pursue, measures designed to regulate the “gig economy.” For example, in 2019, the California Assembly passed AB-5, codifying a narrow worker classification test known as the “ABC test,” which has had the effect of treating many “gig economy” workers as employees. AB-5 includes a referral agency exemption that specifically applies to animal services and dog walking and grooming. We believe that pet care providers who use the Rover platform either satisfy the ABC test, fall within the referral agency exemption, or both. In addition, other jurisdictions could adopt similar laws that do not include such carve outs and which, if applied to Rover’s platform, could adversely impact its availability in those jurisdictions and our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Taxation—If pet care providers are reclassified as employees under applicable law or new laws are passed causing the reclassification of pet care providers as employees or otherwise adopting employment-like restrictions with regard to pet care providers who use our platform, our business would be materially adversely affected” and Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies under the subsection titled “Litigation and Other Contingencies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Other types of new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our business and related technologies. For instance, state and local governments have in the past pursued, or may in the future pursue or enact, licensing, zoning or other regulation that impacts the ability of individuals to provide home-based pet care. Additionally, in the United States, we are required to report payments we process on our platform on behalf of pet care providers who are U.S. persons if they reach certain payment thresholds to the Internal Revenue Service and certain states. The thresholds for this reporting are scheduled to significantly decrease starting with the 2023 tax year pursuant to the American Rescue Plan. In addition to these U.S. reporting requirements, there are a number of international jurisdictions that we operate in which have or are in the process of implementing new tax information reporting requirements. For more information about these tax information reporting requirements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business 
and Industry—Our business and users are subject to tax information reporting requirements in a number of jurisdictions. Such obligations could increase our operational costs and negatively impact the user experience on our platform.”
As we continue to expand our services and offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those discussed above. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Taxation.”
We proactively work with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly.
