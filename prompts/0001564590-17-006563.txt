ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS
 We are an established global gaming company providing to casinos specialized services that improve their table game operations.  Our services are designed to enhance the player’s experience and increase the profitability of our clients and include the design, development, manufacture and acquisition of proprietary table games and associated technology, platforms, systems, expert consultation and other services.
History and Development of Galaxy Gaming
 In 1997, Galaxy Gaming Corporation (“GGCORP”) was formed and distributed a side bet for the game of blackjack known as Horseshoe Blackjack.  GGCORP later modified the invention, changed its name to Lucky Ladies and filed for a patent, which was later granted.
 In 2002, Galaxy Gaming, LLC (“GGLLC”) acquired the business and assets of GGCORP.  Lucky Ladies remained GGLLC’s only product until late 2002, when it debuted a new casino poker game called Texas Shootout.  This game quickly became popular with casinos and their customers.  GGLLC later increased its sales force, expanded its distribution channels and introduced new products and services using reinvested earnings.
 Galaxy Gaming, Inc. (“GGINC”) was formed in 2006 and subsequently acquired the assets and business operations of GGLLC.
 In 2009, GGINC executed a share exchange and reverse merger with Secured Diversified Investment, Ltd. (“SDI”).  After the reverse merger, SDI merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, GGINC, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.180 and changed the name of the company formerly known as SDI to “Galaxy Gaming, Inc.” which remains the operating company as of the date of this report.
 Products and Services
 Casinos use our proprietary products and services to enhance their gaming floor operations and improve their profitability, productivity and security, as well as to offer popular cutting-edge gaming entertainment content and technology to their players.  We market our products and services to land-based, riverboat, cruise ship and internet gaming companies located in North America, the Caribbean, Central America, the British Isles, Europe and Africa and to cruise ships and internet gaming sites worldwide.  We currently serve over 600 casinos that use our enhancements on approximately 5,000 gaming tables.  Additional information regarding our products and services may be found on our website, www.galaxygaming.com.  Information found on the website should not be considered part of this report.
 Proprietary Table Games. Casinos use Proprietary Table Games in lieu of those games in the public domain (e.g. Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, etc.) because of their popularity with players and to increase profitability.  Typically, Proprietary Table Games are grouped into two product types referred to as “Side Bets” and “Premium Games.”  Side Bets are proprietary features and wagering schemes typically added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games.  Examples of our Side Bets include Lucky Ladies, 21+3 and Bonus Craps.  Premium Games are unique stand-alone games with their own unique set of rules and strategies.  Examples of our Premium Games include High Card Flush, Three Card Poker and Texas Shootout.  Generally, Premium Games generate higher revenue per table placement than the Side Bet games.
 Enhanced Table Systems.  Enhanced Table Systems are electronic enhancements used on casino table games to add to player appeal and to enhance game security.  An example in this category is our Bonus Jackpot System (“BJS”), an advanced electronic system installed on gaming tables designed to seamlessly collect data by detecting player wagers and other game activities.  This valuable information is processed and used to improve casino operations by evaluating game play, to improve dealer efficiency and to reward players through the offering of jackpots and other bonusing mechanisms.  Typically, the BJS system includes an electronic video display, known as TableVision, which shows game information designed to generate additional player interest and to promote various aspects of the game.  The BJS system is also used to network numerous gaming tables together into a common system either within a casino or the interconnection of multiple casinos, which we refer to as our Inter-Casino Jackpot System.
 e-Tables.  In 2011, we licensed worldwide rights (excluding Oklahoma, Kentucky and the Caribbean) to the TableMAX e-Table system.  Simultaneously we obtained e-Table rights to the casino table games Caribbean Stud, Caribbean Draw, Progressive Blackjack, Texas Hold’em Bonus and Blackjack Bullets.  A description of this agreement is contained in Note 8 of our audited financial statements included in Item 8.  The TableMAX e-Table system is a fully automated, dealer-less, multi-player electronic table game platform.  In July 2016, we notified TableMAX Corporation of our intent to terminate our agreement with them effective December 31, 2016.  As of the date of this report, we are temporarily providing service on behalf of TableMAX Corporation for one tribal casino operator.

SpectrumVision.  In 2014, we licensed worldwide rights to a patented technology that detects invisible card markings.  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of businesses that offer tools that allow individuals to cheat casinos and card rooms.  These businesses, typically located in China or Eastern Europe, are booming due to the significant revenues they are deriving from sales of cheating products all around the world.  These products typically include daubs or inks that can be used by players to mark cards.  The markings can only be seen by using discrete technology, special glasses or contact lenses.  If a player is able to recognize any face down cards on the table or next card to be dealt, the player can obtain a significant edge resulting in an unfair game and potential significant loses to casinos or other players.  Upon licensing, we further refined and developed the technology which, we branded SpectrumVision.  The SpectrumVision technology utilizes highly specialized and customized optics to see markings on playing cards that would otherwise be invisible or undetectable to the naked eye and surveillance cameras.  SpectrumVision has the ability to see such marking using the entire spectrum of ultra-violet, infrared and natural light.  Units of SpectrumVision began shipping in 2015. 
 Recurring Revenue & Gross Margins
 The majority of our clients contract with us to use our services on a month-to-month basis with typically a 30 – 45 day termination notice requirement.  We invoice our clients monthly (a majority of whom are in advance) unless they have contracted with us to pay for actual services used, in which case we bill in arrears.  Recurring revenues accounted for over 99% of our total revenues in 2016 and generally have few direct costs thereby generating high gross profit margins in excess of 90%.  In lieu of reporting as “gross profit,” this amount would be comparable to “revenues less cost of ancillary products and assembled components” shown on our financial statements included in this report.
 For more information about our revenues, operating income and assets, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this report.
 STRATEGY
 We believe that entertaining casino games will enhance players’ experiences and generate brand loyalty, resulting in increased profits for our casino clients.  We continue to expand our product offering by focusing on innovative products and services.  As we continue to develop and enhance our brand and reputation, we anticipate expanding to new product lines and services that complement our overall strategy and enhance our market presence.
 Our long-term business strategy focuses on increasing our value to our casino clients by offering them enhanced services and support, and by producing innovative products and game play methodologies that their players enjoy.  We believe that by increasing the value of our products and services to our clients, we can continue to build our recurring revenues in both existing and emerging markets.  To achieve this objective, we employ the following strategies:
  
1. | Expand our inventory of services, products and technologies;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Increase our per unit price point by leveraging our Enhanced Table Systems;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Expand our revenues from ancillary products.
---+---------------------------------------------

 Expand our inventory of services, products and technologies.  Historically, only one company in the table game industry, Scientific Games, Inc. (formerly SHFL Entertainment, Inc.)  (“Scientific Games”), has had the ability to offer casinos nearly all of the table game products they require.  Scientific Games’ unique ability to offer numerous products both in terms of game content and what they term as “utility” products (e.g. card shufflers, smart dealing shoes, baccarat displays, etc.), has stifled competition from other companies, including us, who are disadvantaged without a complete product line offering.  Our strategy is to be an alternative for casino operators by offering a complete and comprehensive portfolio of services, games, products, systems, technologies and methodologies for casino table games.  If we achieve this objective, we intend to offer complete turn-key systems rather than compete solely as a purveyor of individual products.  We continuously develop and/or seek to acquire new proprietary table games to complement our existing offerings and to extend our penetration of proprietary table games on the casino floor.  We expect to accomplish this strategic shift through internal development of new products and services as well as continued acquisitions from others.  By offering casinos a complete package of product and services, we believe our competitiveness in the marketplace will increase.
 Increase our per unit price point by leveraging our Enhanced Table Systems.  Our Enhanced Table Systems permit us the opportunity to significantly increase the amount of recurring revenue we receive from each table game placement.  Accordingly, our goal is to concentrate on installing new game placements using one or more of our Enhanced Table Systems and to convert our existing Proprietary Table Game placements that currently do not incorporate our Enhanced Table Systems.  We have modified most of our Premium Table Games and many of our Side Bets to benefit from the economics this new system affords us.  In the future, we intend to be able to offer this platform for all games.
 Expand our revenues from ancillary products.  Historically, the amount of revenue we received from ancillary products is a small percentage of our total revenues.  Although we will continue to focus on our core business leading to the accumulation of high-margin 
 5

recurring revenues, we believe there exists opportunities for us to expand our product offerings, within the table game category, without disrupting our current business operations.  One such example is the continued growth of revenues we receive from on-line gaming, which continues to grow each quarter.  We are researching other opportunities and expect our revenue from ancillary products to steadily increase.
 COMPETITION
 We compete with several companies that develop and provide proprietary table games, electronic platforms, game enhancements and services.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include products and services that appeal to casinos and players, jurisdictional approvals and a well-developed sales and distribution network. 
 We believe that our success will depend upon our ability to remain competitive in our field.  Competition can be based on price, brand recognition, player appeal and the strength of underlying intellectual property. Larger competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, more firmly established supply relationships, superior capital resources, distribution and product inventory than we do.  Smaller competitors may be more able to participate in developing and marketing table games, compared to other gaming products, because of the lower cost and complexity associated with the development of these products and a generally less stringent regulatory environment.  We compete with others in efforts to obtain or create innovative products, obtain financing, acquire other gaming companies, and license and distribute products.  We compete on these bases, as well as on the strength of our sales, service and distribution channels.
 Our competitors include, but are not limited to, Scientific Games, American Gaming Systems, TCS/John Huxley and Masque Publishing.  Moreover, we expect additional competitors to emerge in the future.  There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and failure to compete successfully in the market could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLIERS
 We obtain most of the parts for our products from third party suppliers, including both off-the-shelf items as well as components manufactured to our specifications.  We also manufacture a small number of parts in-house that are used both for product assembly and for servicing existing products.  We generally perform warehousing, quality control, final assembly and shipping ourselves from our facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, although small inventories are maintained and repairs are performed by our field service employees.  We believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate and that alternative sources of materials are available.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 We strive to develop and maintain a robust pipeline of new products and services to bring to market.  We employ a staff of electrical, mechanical and software engineers, graphic artists and game developers at our corporate offices to support, improve and upgrade our products and to develop and explore other potential table game products, technologies, methodologies and services.  We also use contracted third party developers and engineers.
 We have incurred approximately $354,000 and $455,000 in research and development expenditures during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Consistent with our increased focus on development of new product and services, we anticipate significant increases in research and development expenditures in 2017 and future years.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our products and the intellectual property associated with them are typically protected by patents, trademarks, copyrights and other licensing agreements.  There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which could increase the likelihood of infringement.  Furthermore, other companies could develop similar or superior products without violating our intellectual property rights.  If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive, and distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail.
 We have been subject to litigation claiming that we have infringed the rights of others and/or that certain of our patents and other intellectual property are invalid or unenforceable.  We have also brought actions against others to protect our rights.  See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 11 of our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 We are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in most jurisdictions in which we offer our products.  The manufacturing and distribution of casino games, gaming equipment, systems technology and related services, as well as the operation of casinos, are all 
 6

subject to regulation by a variety of federal, state, international, tribal, and local agencies with the majority of oversight provided by individual state gaming control boards. While the regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction, most require:
  
• | Findings of suitability for the company, individual officers, directors, key employees and major shareholders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specific product approvals for gaming equipment manufacturers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licenses, registrations and/or permits.
--+----------------------------------------

 Gaming regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and obtaining licenses, registrations, findings of suitability for our officers, directors, and principal stockholders and other required approvals with respect to us, our personnel and our products are time consuming and expensive.  Generally, gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretionary powers and may deny applications for or revoke approvals on any basis they deem reasonable.  We have approvals that enable us to conduct our business in numerous jurisdictions, subject in each case to the conditions of the particular approvals.  These conditions may include limitations as to the type of game or product we may sell or lease, as well as limitations on the type of facility, such as riverboats, and the territory within which we may operate, such as tribal nations.  We have authorizations with certain Native American tribes throughout the United States that have compacts with the states in which their tribal dominions are located or operate or propose to operate casinos. These tribes generally require suppliers of gaming and gaming-related equipment to obtain authorizations.
 The nature of the industry and our worldwide operations make this process very time consuming and require extensive resources.  We engage legal resources familiar with local customs in certain jurisdictions to assist in keeping us compliant with applicable regulations worldwide.  Through this process, we seek to assure both regulators and investors that all our operations maintain the highest levels of integrity and avoid any appearance of impropriety.
 Gaming laws and regulations serve to protect the public interest and ensure gambling related activity is conducted honestly, competitively, and free of corruption.  Regulatory oversight additionally ensures that the local authorities receive the appropriate amount of gaming tax revenues.  As such, our financial systems and reporting functions must demonstrate high levels of detail and integrity.
 We have obtained or applied for all required government licenses, permits, registrations, findings of suitability and approvals necessary to manufacture and distribute gaming products in all jurisdictions where we directly operate.  Although many regulations at each level are similar or overlapping, we must satisfy all conditions individually for each jurisdiction.
 In addition to what may be required of our officers, board members, key employees and substantial interest holders, any of our stakeholders, including but not limited to investors, may be subject to regulatory requests and suitability findings.  Failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obtaining a finding of unsuitability by a regulatory body could result in a substantial or total loss of investment.
 Gaming jurisdictions.  Legalized gaming jurisdictions typically require various licenses, registrations, findings of suitability, permits, and approvals of manufacturers and distributors of gaming devices and equipment as well as licensure provisions related to changes in control.  In general, such requirements involve restrictions and approvals.  Additionally, we license and/or lease our products through licensed distributors.
 Native American gaming regulation. Gaming on Native American lands within the United States is governed by the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”) and specific tribal ordinances and regulations. Class III gaming (table games and slot machines, for example), as defined under IGRA, also requires a Tribal-State Compact, which is a written agreement between a specific tribe and the respective state. This compact authorizes the type of Class III gaming activity and the standards, procedures and controls under which the Class III gaming activity must be conducted. The National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”) has oversight authority over gaming on Native American lands and generally monitors tribal gaming, including the establishment and enforcement of required minimum internal control standards. Each tribe is sovereign and must have a tribal gaming commission or office established to regulate tribal gaming activity to ensure compliance with IGRA, NIGC, and its Tribal-State Compact. We have complied with each of the numerous vendors licensing and specific product approval and shipping notification requirements imposed by Tribal-State Compacts and enforced by tribal and/or state gaming agencies under IGRA in the Native American lands in which we do business.
 Application of future or additional regulatory requirements. In the future, we intend to seek the necessary registrations, licenses, approvals, and findings of suitability for us, our products, and our personnel in other jurisdictions throughout the world.  However, we may be unable to obtain such necessary items, or if such items are obtained, may be revoked, suspended, or conditioned.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis, or to obtain at all, the necessary approvals of our future products as they are developed, even in those jurisdictions in which we already have existing products licensed or approved.  If the necessary regulations are not sought after or the required approvals not received, we may be prohibited from selling our products in that jurisdiction or may be required to sell our products through other licensed entities at a reduced profit.
