ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 
Argan, Inc. (Argan) conducts operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (GPS), The Roberts Company (TRC), Atlantic Projects Company Limited (APC) and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (SMC) (together referred to as the Company, we, us, or our). The affiliates of GPS include its majority-controlled joint ventures and any variable interest entities for which Argan or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Through GPS and APC, which together provide the major portion of consolidated revenues, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including independent power project owners, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. TRC produces, delivers and installs fabricated steel components specializing in pressure vessels, heat exchangers and piping systems for industrial plants primarily located in the southern United States. In addition, TRC includes a plant services group that handles maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations. SMC provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region.
 
Holding Company Structure
 
Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 1961. We intend to make additional acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that companies acquired in each of these industrial groups will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding company with no operations other than its continuing investments in GPS, TRC, APC and SMC.
Power Industry Services
 
Our Power Industry Services are performed substantially by GPS which is a full service engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor with the proven abilities of designing, building and commissioning large-scale energy projects in the United States. During calendar year 2017, it will celebrate the 20th anniversary of its founding. The extensive design, construction, start-up and operating experience of GPS has grown with installed and under-contract capacity for more than 76 facilities representing over 14,500 MW of power-generating capacity. Our power projects have included base-load combined-cycle facilities, simple-cycle peaking plants and boiler plant construction and renovation efforts. We have also broadened our experience into the renewable energy industry by providing EPC contracting services to the owners of alternative energy facilities, including biomass plants, wind farms and solar fields. Typically, the scope of work for GPS includes complete plant engineering and design, the procurement of equipment and construction from site development through electrical interconnection and plant testing. The durations of our construction projects may extend to three years. In the most recent construction firm rankings published in May 2016 by Engineering News-Record (ENR), GPS was ranked the 17th largest power industry construction contractor and the 54th largest design-build firm in the United States.
 
This reportable business segment also includes APC, a private company formed in Dublin, Ireland, over 40 years ago, and its affiliated companies, which we acquired in May 2015 for approximately $8.8 million in consideration, net of cash acquired. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment installation, commissioning and outage services to original equipment manufacturers, global construction firms and plant owners worldwide. APC has successfully completed projects in more than 30 countries on six continents. With its presence in Ireland and its other offices located in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and New York, APC expanded our operations internationally for the first time. The operating results of APC have been included in our consolidated operating results since the date of its acquisition.
 
The revenues of our power industry services business segment were $587 million, $388 million and $377 million for the years ended January 31, 2017 (Fiscal 2017), 2016 (Fiscal 2016) and 2015 (Fiscal 2015), respectively, or 87%, 94% and 98% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. During Fiscal 2017, we saw the addition of the CPV Towantic Energy Center project to our backlog of projects, the completion of two natural gas-fired power plant projects for affiliates of Panda Power Funds (Panda), and the performance of EPC services for five current natural gas-fired power plant projects.

(1)         Full Notice to Proceed (FNTP) represents the formal notice provided by the project owner instructing us to commence the activities covered by the corresponding EPC contract without limitation.
 (2)         The Panda Liberty and the Panda Patriot Projects were completed during Fiscal 2017.
 (3)         The FNTP has not been received by us, and the scheduled completion date is yet to be determined. During the quarter ended October 31, 2016, the project owner temporarily suspended new activity on this project pending the receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.
 
During Fiscal 2015, we completed a biomass-fired project for East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ETEC) covering EPC contracting services for a 50 MW power plant fueled by chipped timber. We have been retained by ETEC for the operation and maintenance of this power plant for a term of three years beyond the completion of EPC services.
 
Contract Backlog
 
Contract backlog represents the total accumulated value of projects awarded less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on those contracts at a specific point in time. We believe contract backlog is an indicator of future revenues and earnings potential. Although contract backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or reductions may occur and may reduce contract backlog and our expected future revenues. At January 31, 2017, the contract backlog for this reporting segment was approximately $1.0 billion. The comparable contract backlog as of January 31, 2016 was approximately $1.1 billion.
Project Developmental Activities
 
We opportunistically participate in developmental and related financing activities 1) to develop a proprietary pipeline for future EPC activities, 2) to secure exclusive rights to EPC contracts, and 3) to generate profits through interest and success fees. We partnered with Moxie Energy, LLC (Moxie) to take principal positions in the initial stages of development for three projects in the Marcellus Shale Region. All three developmental efforts were successfully completed resulting in GPS securing the rights for EPC contracts for large scale natural gas-fired power plants. Development efforts for the first two projects, the Panda Liberty Power Project (Panda Liberty) and the Panda Patriot Power Project (Panda Patriot), which were sold to Panda by Moxie, were completed in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 (Fiscal 2014). The development effort for the Caithness Moxie Freedom Generating Station project was completed in Fiscal 2015. Success fees received related to these three projects and recognized in our consolidated financial statements totaled $31.3 million.
Joint Ventures
 
As is common in our industry, EPC contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project or program for a project owner, such as a government agency or a commercial enterprise. These special purpose entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. Accordingly, GPS assigned the EPC contracts for the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot projects to joint ventures that were formed during Fiscal 2014 to perform the work for the applicable project and to spread the bonding risk associated with the projects. Our partner for both ventures is the same large, heavy civil contracting firm. The joint venture agreements provide that GPS has the majority interest in any profits, losses, assets and liabilities that result from the performance of these EPC contracts for the projects. However, if the joint venture partner is unable to pay its share of any losses that may arise in the future, GPS would be fully liable. GPS has no significant remaining commitments beyond those related to the provision of warranty services under the EPC contracts for the completed Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot projects. The joint venture partners dedicated resources to the projects that were necessary to complete the power plants; they have been reimbursed for their costs. GPS has performed most of the activities pursuant to these EPC contracts. Due to our financial control over the joint ventures, they are included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Materials
 
In connection with the engineering and construction of traditional power plants, biodiesel plants and other renewable energy systems, we procure materials for installation on the various projects. With our assistance, the project owners frequently procure and supply certain major components of the power plants such as the natural gas-fired combustion turbines. We are not dependent upon any one source for materials that we use to complete a particular project, and we are not currently experiencing difficulties in procuring the necessary materials for our contracted projects. However, we cannot guarantee that in the future there will not be unscheduled delays in the delivery of materials and equipment ordered by us or a project owner.
Competition
 
We compete with numerous large and well capitalized private and public firms in the construction and engineering services industry. These competitors include Bechtel Corporation, Fluor Corporation and Black & Veatch, global firms providing engineering, procurement, construction and project management services; SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., a diversified Canadian construction and engineering firm; Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., a diversified firm providing consulting, engineering, construction and facilities management services; Skanska AB, a leading international project development and construction company; and Kiewit Corporation, an employee-owned global construction firm. These and other competitors are multi-billion dollar companies with thousands of employees. We also may compete with regional construction services companies in the markets where planned projects might be located.
 
To compete with these firms, we emphasize our proven track record as a cost-effective choice for the design, build and commissioning of natural gas-fired and alternative energy power systems. Our extensive and successful experience includes the efficient completion of natural gas-fired simple cycle and combined cycle power plants, wood/coal-fired plants, waste-to-energy plants, wind farms, solar fields and biofuel processing facilities, all performed on an EPC contract basis. Through the power industry services segment, we provide a full range of competitively priced development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and maintenance services to project owners. We are able to react quickly to their requirements while bringing a strong, experienced team to help navigate through difficult technical, scheduling and construction issues. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to assist in the development and delivery of innovative renewable energy solutions as world energy needs grow and efforts to reduce the effects of climate change increase.
 
Customers
 
For Fiscal 2017, the Companys most significant power industry service customers were NTE Ohio LLC; CPV Towantic, LLC; Moxie Freedom LLC; NTE Carolinas LLC and Panda Patriot LLC, which together represented 79% of consolidated revenues for the year. Each of these projects accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017.
 
For Fiscal 2016, we recognized revenues associated with EPC contract services provided to Panda Patriot LLC and Panda Liberty LLC, the owners of the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot projects, which represented approximately 73% of consolidated revenues in the aggregate.
 
Similar to Fiscal 2016, we also recognized significant portions of revenues for Fiscal 2015 pursuant to the EPC contracts for the Panda Liberty and Panda Patriot projects that represented approximately 86% of consolidated revenues in the aggregate for the year.
 
Regulation
 
Our power industry service operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement, employee compensation and security clearance requirements. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Industrial Fabrication and Field Services
 
On December 4, 2015, we acquired TRC, which was founded in 1977 and is headquartered near Greenville, North Carolina. TRC is principally an industrial steel fabricator and field services provider for both light and heavy industrial organizations primarily in the southern United States. We paid $0.5 million to acquire the member interests of TRC, and assumed approximately $15.6 million in debt obligations which we paid off on the acquisition date. TRC continues to operate under its own name with its own management team. Historically, TRC has been primarily a profitable company that incurred a net loss in 2015 up to the date of its acquisition by us, primarily due to it taking on large contracts that resulted in significant losses. With the reengagement and leadership of TRCs founder, John Roberts, our financial support and the substantial completion of these loss contracts, we acquired TRC with the belief that it is positioned to succeed in the future with a return to profitable operations. However, there can be no assurances that TRC will succeed in the future or will resume sustained profitability. Since the acquisition, we advanced an additional $22.5 million in cash to TRC in order to fund the completion of the work on the loss contracts, to enhance working capital and for other general corporate purposes. However, no advances have been made since March 2016.
 
TRCs major customers include some of North Americas largest forest products companies, such as Weyerhaeuser, Resolute, Domtar and Georgia Pacific, mining companies and large fertilizer companies, such as PotashCorp. For Fiscal 2017, TRC generated revenues and pre-tax income of $79.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively, and completed the large pre-acquisition contracts that resulted in significant losses. Currently, TRC operates as its own reportable business segment, Industrial Fabrication and Field Services.
 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
 
Through SMC, which represents our telecommunications infrastructure services reportable business segment, we provide comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to customers in the mid-Atlantic region. We perform both outside plant and inside plant cabling. The revenues of SMC were $9.4 million, $10.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or approximately 1%, 2% and 2% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
 
Services provided to our outside premises customers include trench-less directional boring and excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor lighting systems. The outside premises services are primarily provided to state and local government agencies, regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial customers. The wide range of inside premises wiring services that we provide to our customers include the structuring, cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the physical transport for high speed data, voice, video and security networks. These services are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities.
 
Consistently, a major portion of SMCs revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with SMCs major customers. Over the last three years, these major customers have included the Maryland Transit Administration and other state agencies; counties and municipalities located in Maryland; EDS and Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, a local electricity cooperative.
 
SMC operates in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services industry. We compete with service providers ranging from small regional companies, which service a single market, to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in the telecommunication and utility infrastructure services industry. We intend to emphasize our high quality reputation, outstanding customer base and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts.

Financing Arrangements
 
We have financing arrangements with Bank of America (the Bank) that are described in a Replacement Credit Agreement, effective August 10, 2015 (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement, which supersedes our prior arrangements with the Bank, provides a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $10.0 million that is available until May 31, 2018 with interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover standby letters of credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. There were no actual borrowings outstanding under the Bank financing arrangements as of January 31, 2017 or 2016. Borrowing availability in the amount of $3.0 million has been designated to cover a letter of credit issued by the Bank, with a current expiration date of June 30, 2017, for insurance exposures.
 
We have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Banks consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank requires that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each of our fiscal quarter-ends. As of January 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We believe we will continue to comply with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
 
The commercial bank that supports the activities of TRC has issued an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit on its behalf in the amount of $0.4 million with a current expiration date in January 2018.
 
Safety, Risk Management, Insurance and Performance Bonds
 
We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits. GPS, TRC and SMC each have an experienced full time safety director committed to ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable permits, insurance and local and environmental laws. Contracts with customers in each of our reportable business segments may require performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. Under such circumstances and/or as a means to spread project risk, we may consider an arrangement with a joint venture party in order to provide the required bonding to a prospective project owner (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). We maintain material amounts of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet, and, as indicated above, we have the commitment of the Bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million in support of our bonding collateral requirements. As of January 31, 2017, we had $0.8 billion in bonded backlog related to GPS.
Employees
 
The total number of personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and the relative amount of work performed by subcontractors. We had approximately 1,286 employees at January 31, 2017, substantially all of whom were full-time. We believe that our employee relations are good.
