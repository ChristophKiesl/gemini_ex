Item 1. Business.
Our Corporate History 

We were incorporated on May 31, 1994 in the State of Florida as Information Systems Associates, Inc. (the Company, we, us, our). Initially, our business operations consisted of consulting services for asset management of large corporate data centers and development and licensing of Information Technology (IT) asset management software. On April 1, 2015, we completed a reverse triangular merger, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) among Duos Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation (DTI), the Company, and Duos Acquisition Corporation, a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub merged with and into DTI, whereby DTI remained as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, on July 10, 2015, the Company effected a name change to Duos Technologies Group, Inc.
Overview

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary DTI, focuses on the design, development and turnkey delivery of proprietary intelligent technologies that enable our customers to derive measurable increases in return on investment for their business. Our technologies integrate with our customers existing business process and create actionable information to streamline mission critical operations. Our target market is the largest transportation, industrial and retail corporations representing over $10 billion in total available market. Our technologies have been verified by multiple government and private organizations including Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Transportation Technology Center, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads, and a transportation research and testing organization (TTCI). The Company has worked with these organizations over the past several years where we have supplied funded prototypes of our technologies to verify technology and operating parameters. 

The Company provides a broad range of sophisticated intelligent technology solutions with an emphasis on security, inspection and operations for critical infrastructure within a variety of industries including transportation, healthcare, retail, law enforcement, oil and gas and utilities sectors. Our business operations are in two business units: intelligent technologies and IT asset management. Our proprietary applications, specific to critical infrastructure, include but are not limited to:

Intelligent Rail Inspection Portal 

·
 A suite of several sub-systems for the automated inspection of freight or transit railcars while in motion. The objective is to automatically detect a variety of anomalies such as open or missing hatches, open cargo doors, illegal riders hiding in cargo wells, and foreign objects hidden under a car undercarriage, all while the train is traveling through various strategic areas (i.e. border crossings or inspection areas). 
Tunnel and Bridge Security 

·
 A suite of artificial intelligence-based homeland security applications for the security of critical tunnels and bridges.

Virtual Security Shield

·
 A suite of artificial intelligence-based homeland security applications for the security of critical areas and buffer zones. This application includes intrusion detection zone, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking and discriminating Friend or Foe modules (Friend or Foe refers to a Radio Frequency - based tagging system that validates individuals authorized to be in a specific area).


1

Facility Safety and Security

·
 A suite of artificial intelligence-based homeland security applications for the hardening or safety and resilience of facilities against natural or man originated threats for the protection of critical facilities (energy, water, chemical facilities). The Company and all of its staff are CFATS (Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards) certified.
Remote Bridge Operation

·
 Proprietary system for remote control of draw bridges.

Collision Alert, Monitoring and Impact Analysis System

·
 A system designed to automatically detect, document and record maritime vessels colliding with bridge structures, thereby causing significant damages, in real-time.

Pantograph Inspection System

·
 A system designed to inspect pantographs (structure connecting transit locomotives to high voltage power lines) for the detection of excessive depletion of carbon liners, which may cause power line ruptures.
Vehicle Undercarriage Examiner (Security)

·
 A system that builds upon our current undercarriage inspection technology. This second generation unit is able to inspect the undercarriage of railcars (both freight and transit rail) traveling at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour.
Vehicle Undercarriage Examiner (Mechanical Inspection)

·
 Under a similar development grant from the TTCI (the technology evaluation arm of the American Association of Railroads (AAR)), we developed a prototype targeting mechanical and structural anomalies of undercarriage components. The addition of algorithms for an increasing number of automated detection of anomalies is a continuing development, which once completed and successfully tested, may have a significant impact on our revenues. The next version upgrade is scheduled to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
Multi-Layered Enterprise Command and Control Interface

·
 Aggregator and central point for information consolidation, systems management and communications of our proprietary systems and third-party applications.

Several significant new programs and technologies are currently under development and in various stages of maturity. Some of the more significant developments are:

Neural Network Modeling for detection algorithms

·
 A neural network is a powerful computational data model, able to capture and represent complex input/output relationships. The neural network includes the development of an artificial system that could perform "intelligent" tasks like those performed by the human brain, including the acquisition of knowledge through deep learning, which is stored within inter-neuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights.
Automated Retail Facility Logistics

·
 We are currently in the process of developing a comprehensive system to automate facility security gate operations.


2

Transit Rail Platform Analytics

·
 We have been selected by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCT) to provide a pilot (proof of concept) of our Platform Analytics Technology concept. The technology is designed to automatically detect objects falling on tracks adjacent to transit passenger platforms and to alert incoming rail traffic to that effect.
Intelligent Pedestrian Identification Portal

·
 A system that will integrate several biometric data points from inbound and outbound pedestrians to and from the US. The system will enable US Customs to automatically capture critical biometric data from visitors entering and leaving the country without slowing down pedestrian traffic. The data will be processed by our combined Praesidium® and Centraco platforms and result in the capability of tracking inbound visitors that overstay their permitted visa duration. We have submitted a comprehensive proposal to receive an award for a pilot system for proof of concept during the current fiscal year.
Our Customers

DTI, our wholly owned subsidiary, operates our Intelligent Technologies Division which develops and implements an array of sophisticated, proprietary technology applications and turnkey engineered systems.  Initially developed and deployed for homeland and border security, these applications are used by major freight rail operators (also known as Class-1, such as Union Pacific, CSX, and KCS). After achieving initial success in the transportation industry, the Company broadened its market reach, adapting its proprietary technologies to a suite of applications. This suite of applications now services the commercial, industrial, healthcare, utilities and government sectors. Our current major customers include Amtrak, Burlington Northern (BNSF), Concho Oil, Conrail, CSX, Chicago Metra, Metrolink, Kansas City Southern de Mexico (KCSM), Ferromex, Kohls, Olin Chemical, TTCI and Union Pacific. 

Additionally, DTI operates our IT Asset Management (ITAM) division which provides infrastructure and device audit services for large data centers. In 2010 we were awarded a process patent for our methodology for the efficient data collection and audit of IT assets. The Company markets its ITAM services through strategic partners.

Our goal is to provide our end users with improved situational awareness and overall efficiencies in operations by leveraging smart technology as a force multiplier. Our established customer base includes Class 1 Railroads (freight and transit), transportation, healthcare, retail, law enforcement, oil and gas and utilities sectors as well as the largest and most complex data centers. Our current technology solutions are designed for specific industries, however, the underlying core technologies are industry agnostic and suitable for adaptation to a wide range of applications and industries.

Market

At this time, our primary target market is rail transportation. We implement our products in railcar security inspection with a focus on providing our customers with the capability of performing mission critical security inspections of inbound trains crossing US borders from a centralized, remote location. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency uses our systems at U.S./Mexican border rail crossings. Additionally, opportunities exist within the entire operating environment with initial emphasis on freight carriers by providing mechanical inspection portals for the remote inspection of railcars while traveling at high speeds. Unlike trucks, barges, and airlines, freight railroads operate almost exclusively on infrastructure that they own, build, and maintain. According to the AAR article on Freight Railroad Capacity and Investment dated April 2016, from 1980 to 2015 freight railroads alone reinvested approximately $600 billion of their own funds in capital expenditures and maintenance projects related to locomotives, freight cars, tracks, bridges, tunnels and other infrastructure related equipment.  The AAR further reports, that more than 40 cents out of every revenue dollar is reinvested into a rail network.

According to AARs statistical railroad report, there are approximately 1.56 million freight cars and 26,574 locomotives in service operated on approximately 250,000 miles of active rail tracks throughout North America. Rail tracks are predominantly owned by the Class-I railroad industry which include:
 

Class-I Railroads | Tracks Owned in:
Canada | USA | Mexico
BNSF Railway | ü | ü | x
Canadian National Railway (CN) | ü | ü | x
Canadian Pacific | ü | ü | x
CSX Transportation | ü | ü | x
Ferrocarril Mexicano (Ferromex) | x | x | ü
Kansas City Southern Railway | x | ü | ü
Norfolk Southern | ü | ü | x
Union Pacific Railroad | x | ü | x


The report further elaborates that profitability of rail operators is measured by their operating ratio, which is the rail operators operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. According to AARs Annual Spending Data report, the labor cost to run and maintain trains represent a significant portion of their total operating expenses. Revenue is mostly affected by the average velocity of its rolling stock, which determines how much freight or how many passengers a rail operator can transport between destinations and the average speeds.  Railroads implement their own speed limits within Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) guidelines. Average speed is impacted by many factors including, but not limited to:

·
 track curvatures and condition, signaling, and stoppages for inspections (security and mechanical);
 ·
 grade crossings; and
 ·
 physical condition of locomotives and railcars

Freight trains are considered massive in size and weight. Thus, worn or broken parts can have a significantly negative impact on operations. Quicker detection can prevent costly car and track repairs, and derailments. Early detection has the potential to dramatically increase velocity and direct profitability. 

Examples include inspections at rail border crossings by CBP agents, which can often lead to significant delays and mandated mechanical inspections.  Under FRA regulations, each time a railcar departs a yard, terminal, or industrial facility, it is required to be inspected by either a qualified mechanical inspector or a train crew member for specific defects that would adversely affect the safe operation of the train.  There is currently over 70 mechanical and safety inspection criteria, therefore the inspection process typically takes between two and three hours (dwell time) during which each train is grounded in a maintenance yard.  In addition, the current railcar inspection process is tedious, labor intensive, dangerous, and in general, lacks the level of objectivity that may be achievable using technology.

In order to effectively detect structural or mechanical defects, railcar inspectors today need to walk around the car and crawl underneath the undercarriage with a flashlight to inspect each physical component. Because this process is so lengthy, and hazardous, it is only utilized for pre-departure mechanical inspections. Otherwise, cars are only inspected with this level of scrutiny in shops before undergoing major repairs. In addition to the inherent safety and efficiency challenges of manual inspections, records of these inspections are generally not retained unless a billed repair is performed. Thus, the maintenance of railcar structural components is almost entirely reactive rather than predictive, making repairs and maintenance less efficient.

For many years, the rail industry, through the AAR and its subsidiary TTCI, has been evaluating the feasibility of using technology, and has most recently focused on the objective of performing remote mechanical inspections prior to a train arriving at a rail yard.  In the first phase, car inspectors would remotely perform visual inspections of multiple train consists, which are a group of rail vehicles which are permanently or semi-permanently coupled together to form a unified set of equipment, from a regional inspection station, and generate work orders for detected anomalies. These will be distributed to the respective yards prior to a train arriving at the yard facility.  The time-consuming process of physical inspection would be significantly reduced, leading to a significant increase in average velocity and decreased labor cost.  We believe this lends itself to the natural progression of automating the inspection process, taking inspectors from the physical inspection to the required actions for diagnosing and resolving issues.


4

The second phase is to convert the inspection process to a complete automated system that will inspect the entire car via an intelligent system. This would implement a wayside inspection portal employing a combination of sensors capturing live images and sensor data, of each side, top and undercarriage. Software algorithms interpret the data to identify defects or anomalies. This inspection technology increases average speed and consequently overall return on investment of our customers due to the following:

1.
 the safety risks associated with manual car inspection will be minimized through reduced exposure to potential yard hazards; and  
 2.
 reducing inspection time will increase yard efficiency and improve overall network capacity by also reducing the time needed to process inbound and outbound trains.

We believe that the evolution of automating the inspection processes is broadly advocated throughout the industry. In our experience, the freight rail companies are constantly seeking out innovative ways to increase capacity and improve efficiencies while increasing safety and security standards. A recently launched aggressive plan to automate the mechanical inspection process is at the core of our market opportunity.

Our Products and Systems - Technology Platforms

The Companys solution is comprised of two core technology platforms: Praesidium® and Centraco.

These in-house developed software suites are distributed as licensed software suites, and form the centerpiece of our engineered turnkey systems. Each integrated system encompasses three major components:

1.
 The data collectors, including specialized cameras integrated by the Company and other sensors that are specific to the customers requirements (third party supplied or pre-existing);
 2.
 Praesidium, the analytics software suite which performs real-time analysis of the data generated by the Company; and
 3.
 Centraco, the multi-layered presentation interface which graphically depicts the data analyzed and identifies anomalies and provides actionable intelligence.

Since 2002, we have developed and patented key software components that provide a significant competitive advantage in specialized solutions for our target markets. We believe an important factor in this development is that the Companys intellectual property is industry agnostic and can be deployed to many different industries. The following technical descriptions of Praesidium and Centraco provide further insight.

Praesidium® Intelligent Analytics Suite

Praesidium® is an integrated suite of analytics applications which both process and analyze data streams from a virtually unlimited number of conventional or specialized sensors and/or data points. Our algorithms compare analyzed data against user-defined criteria and rules in real time and automatically report any exceptions, deviations and/or anomalies. This application suite also includes a broad range of conventional operational system components and sub-systems, including an embedded feature-rich video management engine and a proprietary Alarm Management Service (AMS). The AMS provides continuous monitoring of all connected devices, processes, equipment and sub-systems, and automatically communicates to Centraco, the Companys enterprise information management suite if and when an issue, event or performance anomaly is detected. The processed information is instantly distributed simultaneously to an unlimited number of users in a visualized and correlated user interface using the Centraco command and control platform.

Our core modules are tailored to specific industry applications and the analytics engine(s) process any type of conventional sensor outputs, also adding intelligence to any third-party sensor technology. A key benefit is that the customer may often retain existing systems and we would integrate these into an overall solution.

As listed on the safetyact.gov website, the Praesidium® video analytics technology has received Safety Act designation from the US Department of Homeland Security.  We are one of only ten companies to have received this designation for video related solutions and Praesidium® is the only video analytics application with this designation.

Over the years, our proprietary analytics suite has been expanded to meet a significant number of security objectives and environments, adaptable to a broad range of critical infrastructure target verticals including but not limited to commercial transportation (rail, air and seaports), retail, healthcare, utilities, oil, gas and chemical, and government.

Centraco Enterprise Command and Control Suite

Centraco is an Enterprise Information Management (EIM) system. It was designed as a multi-layered command and control interface and to function as the central point and aggregator for information consolidation, connectivity and communications. The platform is browser based and completely agnostic to the interconnected sub-systems. It provides full LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, also known as Active Directory) integration for seamless user credentialing and performs the following major functions:

· | Collection: Device management independently collects data from any number of disparate devices or sub-systems. 
· | Analysis: Correlates and analyzes data, events and alarms to identify real-time situations and their priorities for response measures and end-users Concept of Operations (CONOPS). 
· | Verification: The contextual layer represents relevant information in a quick and easily interpreted format which provides operators optimal situational awareness. 
· | Resolution: Event-specific presentation of user-defined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), that includes a step-by-step instruction on how to resolve situations. 
· | Reporting: Tracking of data and events for statistical, pattern and/or forensic analysis. 
· | Auditing: Device-level drill down that records each operators login interaction with the system and tracks manual changes including calculations of operator alertness and reaction time for each event.

Engineered Solutions

The Company has always delivered engineered solutions which translate into the ability to implement a practical solution to specific customer requirements. Often, software is developed where implementation is the responsibility of the customer. We believe that delivering and supporting turnkey working systems that provide measurable end solutions are the preferred business model for our customers. We also believe that any implementation must co-exist in an already functioning operation and that any solution must work within existing business practices. Due to this philosophy, over time, our code base has been expanded to integrate a myriad of third-party sensor technologies thereby creating complete engineered solutions that dovetail into existing environments and thus not forcing our customers to replace working legacy systems. These engineered solutions usually address more complex end-user requirements and are typically designed, developed, deployed and maintained by the Company in a direct relationship with the end-user on a turnkey basis.

The combination of our two platforms (Praesidium® and Centraco) with its many variants has and continues to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions, some of which already play a significant role in pro-active homeland security including cross border commercial rail transport.

More recently, we created several proprietary, turnkey systems and applications for commercial railways, the most significant being the following:

Intelligent Rail Inspection Portal (rip). This turnkey system was originally designed for rail security and inspection at rail border crossings. Under a Union Pacific (UP) funded pilot program the Company designed, developed and deployed an intelligent inspection portal to provide the CBP a tool that aids customs officers in the inspection of inbound and outbound railcars. The rip system uses multiple proprietary technologies and sub-systems to remotely scan all railcars passing through the inspection portal, then displays stitched 360-degree views of the entire rail consist. 

Users conduct a quick review of the pre-screened imagery and decide whether to refer specific areas of interest to field personnel for further (physical) inspection.

Panoramic View of Stitched Train Consists  Security Application

Using sensors and analytical algorithms, we pre-screen railcars and automatically detect and report anomalies and deviations from established norms. After successfully passing rigorous testing this system has now been adopted into the CBP standard concept of operation for southwestern rail border crossings and has been deployed at southwestern border locations, with a few remaining locations currently under negotiation.  Similar systems have been deployed to two (undisclosed) locations in Mexico, and are currently monitored by the Mexican subsidiary of Kansas City Southern (KCS).

Subsequent to the completion of this security-centric application, we recently completed our next generation system expansion which addresses automation of the mechanical inspection for rolling stock, capable of adjusting to variable speeds of up to 70 MPH. Our comprehensive Intelligent Rail Inspection Portal incorporates our proprietary Vehicle Undercarriage Examiner (VUE), in addition to other technologies, and is considered to be a game changer for the rail industry. Utilizing Centraco as the system interface, the user accesses a variety of features enabling remote inspection, analysis and detection from the safety of remote command centers. Images containing detailed views of areas of concern, determined to be potentially suspicious, are automatically presented to a human operator for further inspection. | Rail Inspection Portal

Automatic Detection of Missing Bolt at High Speed

The development and field-testing of the core application was completed successfully during the third quarter of the 2016 fiscal year.  After an extensive Request for Proposal (RFP) process, we received a contract award in early 2016 to deploy our technology at a live site from CSX Transportation, one of North Americas Class I railroads.  The award is considered to be a real-time test run in anticipation of adapting our technology as a process standard.  We received a similar award from Ferromex, Mexicos largest rail operator mid-year 2016.  Both systems have recently been completed, delivered, and are currently undergoing live testing.

At the present time, our rip™ application provides the following modules for automated analysis, detection and inspection:

·
 Linear Panorama Generator;
 ·
 Automated Detection of Open Doors;
 ·
 Automated Detection of Open/Missing Hatches;
 ·
 Train Rider Detection System (trids™);
 ·
 Under Vehicle Inspection with Foreign Object Detection (vue™);
 ·
 Gondola Car Inspection System;
 ·
 Pantograph Inspection System (apis™); and
 ·
 3D modeling using LIDAR technology for Transit platform intrusion detection (under development).

Utilizing the Centraco™ command and control platform as the system interface, the user accesses a variety of features enabling remote inspection, analysis and detection from the safety of remote command centers. Images containing detailed views of areas of concern, determined to be potentially suspicious, are automatically presented to a human operator for further inspection. Users conduct a quick review of the pre-screened imagery and decide whether to refer specific areas of interest to field personnel for further (physical) inspection and/or repair. 
 
The system also resolves the particularly difficult process of inspecting railcar undercarriages by providing high resolution images of the entire undercarriage. The system is designed to help streamline the physical inspection process by narrowing the number of inspection targets down to cars with potential anomalies. Consequently, the detection sensitivity is intentionally set to err on the safe side to avoid false negatives. Our customers are in the process of awarding the development of a significant number of detection algorithms, which combined with our Inspection Portal technology, will eventually facilitate full automation of the mechanical inspection process. We believe to be well positioned to capture a significant portion of this phase of the automation process.

We are currently in the process of adapting our inspection portal technology to the retail industry and have recently received an award from Kohls to automate in- and outbound traffic controls at their distribution centers. A respective pilot project is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2017.

We recently received an award from the NYCT to develop a pilot system using our intelligent technology to automatically detect intrusions to their passenger platform tracks. NYCT plans to deploy technology to their 470+ transit stations to minimize derailments caused by objects falling onto their tracks. We are in the process of developing a multi-layered detection system and expect to complete this new system during the third quarter of 2017.

IT Asset Management

Our IT Asset Management (ITAM) division is dedicated to the mission of developing, marketing and delivering software and professional services to the worlds largest data centers. The focus of its technology and knowledgebase evolved out of our core strength in collecting and analyzing data on assets resident within these large data centers. Over the next three years, the Company plans to further develop its software and service offerings, and market these solutions for the growing ITAM market place either as a standalone asset management solution or in conjunction with a comprehensive Datacenter Infrastructure Management (DCIM) solution from other vendors. We believe DCIM is the ability to bridge the gap between critical IT assets and facilities infrastructure. 

Using our proprietary patented methodology, the Company surveys and audits large data centers by physically identifying each piece of equipment and its location. By scanning it into our proprietary system and providing the client with a report detailing type, quantity and location of its IT assets, (racks, servers, network cards, power supplies, etc.), we afford our clients the ability to verify their own internal records. 

In line with the Companys philosophy of integration with existing systems, the design of our process methodology and related software mean that we can work with almost any other DCIM provider. Specifically, the Company will focus on the asset management requirements of our clients and partners within specific geographic locations that will allow the Company to balance its investment requirements with income potential to develop a sustainable business in this division. The Company has selected this specific application of its technology to seek revenue opportunities that are readily available in an identified market. We generate profits from this division by maintaining a low level of bench staff and hire independent consultants as we are awarded business opportunities. The Company is currently developing a new ITAM system which is expected to be released in the second quarter of 2017. We expect that this will generate revenues from software sales and maintenance starting in 2018.

Specific Areas Of Competition

Since inception, we have implemented a strategy of diversification to mitigate the potential vulnerabilities experienced by companies with a narrow business scope. We believe many public companies in the micro- and nano-cap ecosystem suffer major challenges due to their lack of diversification, and their single product strategy has made many of these companies irrelevant in the market place. 
 
During the past several years, we have made considerable investments in, and have successfully developed, our two core technology platforms, Praesidium® and Centraco®. 

Praesidium® is an open architecture, modular engine that manages an unlimited number of back end process and analytics frameworks. In addition to driving our own proprietary sensor and data analytics, this core technology also allows for the integration of an unlimited number of third-party technologies, systems and sub-systems. Third-party industry or task-specific processes are modularized and embedded into the Praesidium® engine, thereby substantially expanding the functionality of such third-party system. While we believe most companies tailor their products and services to a specific industry, this core platform is industry agnostic which we believe will allow us to penetrate multiple industries. Our past and current concentration on specific target markets such as rail, retail, healthcare, utilities, chemical, gas and oil, and government has enabled us to test the markets with our innovative technology solutions. Our Praesidium® platform competes currently with the following sector specific companies: 


Intelligent Video Analytics | Rail Inspection Portal 
Security | Mechanical | Security 
Agent Video Intelligence Ltd. Agent VI (Israel) | Trimble Inc. (Acquired Beena Vision Systems Inc.) | No direct competition at this time (1)


Robert Bosch GmbH, Germany | Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd (LYNXRAIL) - Australia (Tracks, wheels and wayside only) | Beena Vision (development stage, just entering the market place)
SightLogix, Inc. 
IntelliVision Technologies Corp (USA)
Avigilon Corporation (Video IQ) | KLD Labs Inc. (Tracks, wheels and wayside only) | 
 | MERMEC S.p.A - Italy Tracks, wheels and wayside only) |

 We believe we are the first to develop the concept of an intelligent rail inspection portal used for comprehensive inspection of security threads and at this time we are unaware of any competitor in this sector. Recently, the AAR, through its technology research subsidiary TTCI, has engaged us to adapt our security portal technology to an automated mechanical inspection system. We are currently in stage 2 of 3 of this development. We believe our potential competitors in this area are currently focusing chiefly on the inspection of wheels, bearings, breaks and track alignment. We expect that any competitor interested in expanding their inspection technologies to the ones we have developed over the past four years would require at least 2-3 years of research and development before being able to produce similar systems for real time testing. We believe the testing cycle will take at least an additional 1-2 years for potential competition. The AAR/TTCI is currently conducting beta testing only with our systems. Similarly, the CBP (US Customs and Border Protection) and Union Pacific Railroad are using our systems as their only security inspection infrastructure at the US border. 

Centraco® is an open architecture aggregator and fusion engine which functions as a comprehensive front end user interface. This framework combines our proprietary modules with an unlimited number of 3d-party technologies. In addition to a wide range of proprietary embedded features, such as video management (VMS), alarm management (AMS), LDAP network access credentialing and many more, Centraco® intelligently manages unlimited types of data sources and allows control and monitoring of this wide array of sensors and data from a single unified interface. This platform includes both the traditional Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) systems as well as a full-scale Enterprise Information Management System (EIMS). We believe we are at an advantage because none of our competitors product offerings include both PSIM and EIMS, nor do any of the competing products allow for the integration of embedded engineered solutions. Our competitors in this area include:


PSIM 
· Qognify (Formerly NICE) | · CNL 
· VidSys | · Proximex

We believe the PSIM market is rapidly expanding and we expect that capability requirements will substantially increase. Companies increasingly require expanded capabilities to justify the investment in their digital infrastructure for use by multiple corporate disciplines (security, building management, IT, network access control management). 

Our Growth Strategy

Our strategy is to grow our business through a combination of organic growth of our applications and technology solutions, both within our existing geographic reach and through geographic expansion, as well as expansion through strategic acquisitions.
Organic Growth

Our organic growth strategy is to increase our market share through the expansion of our business development team and our research and development talent pool, which will enable us to significantly expand our current solution offerings with feature rich applications, and the development of new and enhanced technology solutions. We plan to augment such growth with strategic relationships both in the business development and research and development arenas, reducing time to market with additional industry applications, expansion of existing offerings to meet customer requirements as well as potential geographical expansion into international territories.
Strategic Acquisitions

Planned acquisition targets include sector specific technology companies with the objective of augmenting our current capabilities with feature-rich (third-party) solutions. The decision-making process includes, but is not limited to, weighing time, effort and approximate cost to develop certain technologies in-house, versus acquiring or merging with one or more entities that we believe have a proven record of successfully developing a technology sub-component. Additional criteria include evaluating the potential acquisition targets customer base, stage of technology, merger or acquisition cost as compared to market conditions.

Manufacturing and Assembly

The Company streamlines its manufacturing by outsourcing component manufacturing to qualified fabricators. On-site installations are performed using a combination of in-house project managers/engineers and specialist sub-contractors as necessary. We maintain responsibility for the system implementation, servicing and tech support for our solutions. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our engineers. If not manufactured internally, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers, and a build-to-order methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available. 
Research and Development 

The Companys research and development team designs and develops all its systems and software applications. We develop the substantial majority of our products internally. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have several United States and foreign patents and patent-pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, and changing customer requirements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development efforts, including software development, to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.
Government Regulations

The Company has been working with various agencies of the federal government for more than 10-years including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our video analytics are DHS Safety Act certified, and our staff is Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) certified. The Companys Homeland Security solutions include sophisticated remote systems that combine and synchronize a myriad of sensing technologies, wireless communications, and innovative intelligent sensor applications.
Intellectual Property

Our business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our technologies, solutions and products. We have developed a broad portfolio of intellectual property that covers our application software as well as the sensor and data acquisition process of our security and inspection analytics platforms. As of December 31, 2016, we have 9 patents and 21 trademarks issued or granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and we have 2 pending patent applications with the USPTO. Areas of our development activities that have culminated in filings and/or awarded patents include: 

We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties. 

In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress, domain name and patents to protect our products and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to our software code, as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our products are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in locations outside the United States. 

As discussed in the risk factors section herein, we may face allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed their trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights.

Employees

We have a current staff of 36 employees, none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
