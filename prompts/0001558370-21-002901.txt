Item 1. Business
As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, ISG, the registrant, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our.”
Our Company
ISG (Information Services Group) (Nasdaq: III) is a leading global technology research and advisory firm. A trusted business partner to over 700 clients, including more than 75 of the top 100 enterprises in our markets, ISG is committed to helping corporations, public sector organizations, and service and technology providers achieve operational excellence and faster growth. The firm specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. Founded in 2006, and based in Stamford, Conn., ISG employs approximately 1,300 digital-ready professionals operating in more than 20 countries—a global team known for its innovative thinking, market influence, deep industry and technology expertise, and world-class research and analytical capabilities based on the industry’s most comprehensive marketplace data. For more information, visit www.isg-one.com.
Our Company was founded in 2006 with the strategic vision to become a high-growth, leading provider of information-based advisory services. We continue to believe that our vision will be realized through the acquisition, integration, and successful operation of market-leading brands within the data, analytics and advisory industry. While one unified company and brand, we have global reach to service the various technology needs of our multinational clients, as we operate in over 20 countries and employ approximately 1,300 professionals specializing in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics, sourcing advisory, managed governance and risk services, network carrier services, technology strategy and operation design, change management, market intelligence and technology research and analysis.
Our private and public sector clients continue to face significant technological, business and economic challenges that will continue to fuel demand for the professional services we provide. We are focused on providing unique solutions that solve for key client problems. In the private sector, for example, we believe that companies will continue to face significant challenges associated with globalization and technological innovation, including the need to decrease operating costs, increase efficiencies and deal with increasing numbers of emerging and transformational technologies such as cloud computing and automation. Similarly, public sector organizations at the national, regional and local levels increasingly must deal with the complex and converging issues of outdated technology systems, reduced budgets and an aging workforce. These technological challenges have only been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting remote work environment and, therefore, present further opportunity for ISG to assist our private and public sector clients with digital transformation services.
Overall, we believe that the global marketplace dynamics at work in both the private and public sectors support the increased demand of the professional services, analytics, platforms, and advice ISG can provide. In this dynamic environment, the strength of our client relationships greatly depends on the quality of our advice and insight, the independence of our thought leadership and the effectiveness of our people in assisting our clients to implement strategies that successfully address their most pressing operational challenges.
We are organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. The current mailing address of the Company’s principal executive office is: Information Services Group, Inc., 2187 Atlantic Street, Stamford, CT 06902. Our telephone number is (203) 517-3100.
Our Services
ISG specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. ISG supports both private and public sector organizations to transform and optimize their operational environments. During periods of expansion or contraction, for enterprises large or small, public or private, in the Americas, Europe or Asia Pacific, our services have helped organizations address their most complex operational issues. The functional domain experience of our experts and deep empirical data resources help clients better understand their strategic options.
ISG has launched a new operating model, ISG NEXT, aimed at extending the firm’s market leadership, enhancing growth opportunities, and driving significant value for all stakeholders. Under ISG NEXT, we are pivoting from services to solutions to address our clients’ most pressing business challenges in two areas most important to them—their continuing digital transformation and getting the most from their digital investments. To meet these needs, we have formed two global client solution areas: ISG Digital, focused on developing technology, transformation, sourcing and digital solutions for clients, and ISG Enterprise, focused on helping clients manage change and optimize operations in such areas as finance, HR and Procure2Pay.

Our core solutions are supported by ISG Research, with its extensive market analyses and provider evaluations; our ISG Network and Software Advisory services, and our software platforms, including ISG GovernX®. We also are building more industry-specific capabilities, in such areas as banking, insurance and smart manufacturing.
Every client engagement now passes through our dedicated Solution Hub, to bring the best thinking, tools and capabilities to bear to solve every client challenge. Integrated solutions are then delivered through our new ISG iFlex™ global delivery model, which enables us to rapidly deploy our resources to support clients, regardless of geography or time zone.
Our Competitive Advantages
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competition:
● Independence and Objectivity. We are not a business process outsourcing service provider. We are an independent, fact-based data, analytics and advisory firm with no material conflicting financial or other interests. This enables us to maintain a trusted advisor relationship with our clients through our unbiased focus and ability to align our interests with those of our clients.
● Domain Expertise. Averaging over 20 years of experience, our strategic consulting teams bring a wealth of industry and domain-specific knowledge and expertise to address our clients’ most complex transformational needs.
● Strong Brand Recognition. ISG continues to gain marketplace traction as a leading brand in our industry. ISG offers an integrated product and service offering for our clients.
● Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence. We have assembled a comprehensive and unique set of data, analytics and market intelligence built over more than thirty years of data collection and analysis, providing insight into the comparative cost and quality of a variety of operational alternatives.
● Global Reach. We possess practical experience in global business operations, and we understand the significance of interconnected economies and companies. Our resources in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific make us a truly global advisory firm able to consistently serve the strategic and implementation needs of our clients.
We believe that the strengths disclosed above are central to our ability to deal successfully with the challenges that our clients and we face.
Our Strategy
We intend to use our competitive strengths to develop new services and products, sustain our growth and strengthen our existing market position by pursuing the following strategies:
● Preserve and Expand Our Market Share Positions. We expect the trend toward globalization and greater operating efficiency and technological innovation to play an increasing role in the growth of demand for our services. We plan to leverage our combined operating platform to serve the growing number of private and public enterprises utilizing outside advisors when undertaking transformational projects. We are focused on growing our existing client base with broader services. In addition, we will seek to continue to expand our products and services and the geographic markets we serve opportunistically as global competition spurs demand for cost savings and value creation.
● Strengthen Our Industry Expertise. We have strengthened our market facing organization to drive increased revenue around 22 global industries: Automotive, Aerospace & Defense, Banking, Chemicals, Consumer Goods, Energy & Utilities, Financial Services, Government, Health Care, Insurance, Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Media & Entertainment, Metals & Mining, Pharma/Biotech/Medical Devices, Private Equity & M&A, Public Sector & Education, Retail, Technology & Service Providers, Telecommunications, Transportation & Logistics, Travel & Hospitality. 
● Aggressively Expand Our Market Focus. We are seeking to drive our service portfolio and relationships with clients further into: Digital Advisory Services including Cloud Solutions, Automation, Business Advisory Services, Strategy, Data & Analytics, Transition and Organizational Change and Network Advisory are all areas where we are investing additional focus to drive increased revenues and expanded relationships with clients.
● Further Develop Digital Cloud Competency. There is a nexus of distinct, yet complementary, technology trends that are creating a perfect storm of disruption for some companies. Among the most significant technology trends are the speed with which products get to market, large-scale digitization, the efficiency of the cloud and the immediacy with which new disruptors can become omnipresent. We continue to see clear opportunities in the execution of large-scale digital transformation – helping enterprises in executing their transformations by using their large technology platform and partner ecosystems. Our offerings around cost management have never been more important as enterprises search for funds to invest into their digital ambitions. We think the pandemic will accelerate client demand for, and investment in, the digital transformation services ISG provides.

ISG plans to expand resources and intellectual property (“IP”) around digitization and the cloud. Digitization is the ‘softwarization’ of business. Processes that were once executed over analog channels (such as phone and ‘real life’) increasingly happen over software. Also, digitization has elevated the profile of software. Software no longer merely supports business processes but is central to the enterprise strategy. Our purpose in the digital marketplace is to be the trusted advisor, guiding our clients through the digital transformation toward practical innovation of their business models, leveraging strategic partners, emerging technology and thought leadership. 
Our digital services now span a volume of offerings and have become embedded as part of even our traditional transaction service. Advancements continue to be made to ‘digitize’ further our traditional services. For example, we have continued the modernization of our traditional sourcing services toward digital with the launch of ISG FutureSourceTM which has brought agility and nimbleness to the process of sourcing, RFP’s and contracting. ISG FutureSource™ is a unique and comprehensive sourcing solution that helps enterprises and public sector organizations evaluate their business requirements, identify desired outcomes, fast-track the provider identification and selection process, collaborate with providers on developing the right solution, get to a signed contract and transition operations faster than ever before.
We have also expanded the reach of ISG GovernX®. This proprietary ISG software platform continues to drive broader insights from additional market and performance data, while delivering increased value to our clients. ISG GovernX® leverages cognitive technology to automate the management of third-party supplier relationships, including contract and project lifecycles and risk management. ISG GovernX 2020, the newest version of the platform, automates the management of the entire end-to-end contract lifecycle and provides a complete, customized view of the user’s contract and supplier ecosystem to improve supplier performance, decrease spend and reduce third-party risk. Enterprises can leverage cognitive technology and optimized workflows to mitigate supply chain risks and deliver up to 30 percent more value from their outsourcing spend. ISG GovernX® users can easily manage new contracts and proactive renewals, make timely amendments and handle contract terminations—all on one platform. In times of crisis, ISG GovernX® clients can mitigate supply chain risks and ensure business continuity by reviewing and validating their providers’ business and IT continuity plans and procedures. The platform delivers easy integration with other enterprise applications, such as ServiceNow, and is tightly connected to ISG Research offerings, such as benchmarks, assessments and total-cost-of-ownership evaluations.
In 2019 we launched ISG Inform™ 2.0, an enhanced version of our data-as-a-service solution that provides benchmarking capability to track digital transformation and application development maturity and performance against industry peers. ISG Inform™ 2.0 provides a quantified view of the health of the user's enterprise IT landscape through a series of easy-to-read visual dashboards that display key performance indicators for infrastructure, applications and digital capabilities, compared with industry peers. Data and insights are drawn from the ISG sourcing database.
Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation technology is fundamentally reshaping the way businesses work. Automation is increasingly enabling automated 24/7/365 execution of business processes at a fraction of the cost of human equivalents, as well as the dramatic improvements in process execution and cost models.
ISG Automation helps clients navigate the myriad challenges, risks and opportunities from software selection to building their bot workforce to leverage the technology to transform and improve business outcomes.
● Expand Emerging Services. The focus will be on creating repeatable methods used to drive growth of emerging services including ISG Automation, HR Technology & Transformations; Providers as a Business; ISG Platform; and ISG Network Select™.

1. | ISG Automation: ISG’s capabilities and service offerings include implementation services for Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation Technology. ISG Automation guides clients through the hurdles of adoption, ensuring the optimal future state with best-fit technologies. ISG Automation tailors programs to specific business needs and helps build governance that works inside the culture of our clients. The Automation market size is expected to continue to grow significantly over the next few years. Automation is fundamentally reshaping the world of Information Technology Outsourcing (“ITO”) and Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”). Our solutions will work to optimize repetitive processes using ‘bots’ instead of human labor. ISG Automation will continue to be marketed by industry (e.g., claims processing for insurance) and by back office functions (e.g., accounting).

2. | HR Technology & Transformations: Advances in technology are transforming the business of HR. From intuitive and mobile self-service software to predictive analytics and integrated talent management suites, technological solutions are changing the way leaders acquire, develop and engage their employees. New applications, enhanced functionality and competition among software providers make it difficult to stay on top of this ever-evolving space. ISG provides deep subject matter expertise, market data and financial frameworks to help organizations develop and execute HR technology strategies that are right for them.

3. | Providers as a Business (“PaaB”): Historically, ISG had targeted traditional service providers for these types of services, which included a combination of consulting and research solutions. These services include market

intelligence, client retention programs, pursuit effectiveness, satisfaction benchmarking, go-to-market consulting and health checks. 

4. | ISG Platform: We see growth opportunities in tool-enabling the part of consulting that solves for standard problems. The digital solutioning of ISG will reach its next level as we develop the ISG Platform, an integrated set of software-driven solutions, data and research that will allow us to increase our subscription-based recurring revenues and penetrate new market segments. ISG Inform™ and ISG GovernX® will be at the core of the ISG Platform, as will our new set of ISG Select™ offerings that will continue to streamline and digitize the provider selection process. We continue to develop and invest in our ISG Platform, which will help us drive recurring revenues.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | ISG Network Select™: ISG Network Select™ helps streamline and simplify how enterprises build their network solutions. It enables ISG to better meet the growing demand for such leading-edge networking solutions as software-defined networking (SD-WAN, SD-LAN), SD security services, 5G mobility, unified communications as a service (UCaaS) and call center as a service (CCaaS) — all critical to enterprise digital transformation. Client demand for networks that are secure, interconnected, interoperable and profitable is rising, as are concerns over security, scale, cost and the complexity of the expanding Internet of Things (“IoT”) landscape. ISG Network Select is designed to help clients find the best solutions, faster, to power their digital transformation initiatives. Clients get access to detailed and current data on their vendor and technology options, insights to help negotiate better pricing, and processes to accelerate next-generation networking solutions.

● Expand “Recurring Revenue Streams.” These include such annuity-based ISG offerings as ISG GovernX®, Research, Software as a Subscription, ISG Inform™ and the multi-year Public Sector contracts. All are characterized by subscriptions (i.e., renewal centric as opposed to project centric revenue streams) or multi-year contracts. As companies begin to recognize the importance of managing the post sourcing transaction period, managed services has emerged as a revenue driver for us where our offerings are delivered through multi-year managed services contracts. We believe that our experience with outsourcing transactions and software implementation initiatives make us uniquely equipped to provide research insights and direct support to help our clients manage their transformational projects or act as a third-party administrator. We will continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our experience to make research and managed services an even greater revenue generator for us. The U.S. public sector, particularly state governments, local municipalities, and higher education—presents a significant opportunity to ISG. Systems are typically outdated, maintenance is expensive, and the workforce charged with maintenance is aging. There is a need to refurbish systems to reduce the cost of operations (particularly because governments’ tax revenues are under pressure). We are well-positioned as a third party, objective advisory group with no affiliation to the software providers. ISG will continue to invest in the digitization of these services, driving up automation, greater profitability and even more value for our clients. ISG continues to invest in the digitization of these services, leveraging automation and cognitive technologies to deliver greater value to our clients. 
● Consider Acquisition and Other Growth Opportunities. The business services, information and advisory market is highly fragmented. We believe we are well-positioned to leverage our leading market positions and strong brand recognition to expand through acquisitions. Acquiring firms with complementary services and products allows us to further develop and broaden our service offerings and domain expertise. We will consider and may pursue opportunities to enter into joint ventures and to buy or combine with other businesses.
Our Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence
One of our core assets is the information, data, analytics, methodologies and other intellectual property the Company possesses. This intellectual property underpins the independent nature of our operational assessments, strategy development, deal-structuring, negotiation and other consulting services we provide to our clients.
With each engagement we conduct, we enhance both the quantity and quality of the intellectual property we employ on behalf of our clients, thus providing a continuous, evolving and unique source of information, data and analytics.
This intellectual property is proprietary, and we rely on multiple legal and contractual provisions and devices to protect our intellectual property rights. We recognize the value of our intellectual property and vigorously defend it. As a result, the Company maintains strict policies and procedures regarding ownership, use and protection with all parties, including our employees.
Clients
We operate in over 20 countries and across numerous industries. Our private sector clients operate primarily in the manufacturing, banking and financial services, insurance, health sciences, energy & utilities and consumer services industries. Our private sector clients are primarily large businesses ranked in the Forbes Global 2000 companies annually. Our public sector clients are primarily state and local 

8



governments (cities and counties) and authorities (airport and transit) in the United States and national and provincial government units in the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia.
Competition
Competition in the sourcing, data, information and advisory market is primarily driven by independence and objectivity, expertise, possession of relevant benchmarking data, breadth of service capabilities, reputation and price. We compete with other sourcing advisors, research firms, strategy consultants and sourcing service providers. A significant number of independent sourcing and advisory firms offer similar services. In our view, however, these firms generally lack the benchmarking data, scale and diversity of expertise that we possess. In addition, most research firms do not possess the data repository of recent, comparable transactions and benchmarking data. Management consultants bring strategic service capabilities to the sourcing and advisory market. However, they generally lack the depth of experience that sourcing, data and advisory firms such as ISG possess. In addition, management consultants do not possess the sourcing and technology implementation expertise nor the benchmarking data capabilities that are critical to implementing and managing successful transformational projects for businesses and governments. Other service providers often lack the depth of experience, competitive benchmarking data and independence critical to playing the role of “trusted advisor” to clients.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,258 people worldwide.
Our employee base includes executive management, service leads, partners, directors, advisors, analysts, technical specialists and functional support staff.
We recruit advisors from service providers and consulting firms with direct operational experience. These advisors leverage extensive practical expertise derived from experiences in corporate leadership, consulting, research, financial analysis, contract negotiations and operational service delivery.
All employees are required to execute confidentiality, conflict of interest and intellectual property agreements as a condition of employment. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.
Our voluntary advisor turnover rate has ranged between 11% and 22% over the last three years.
Human Capital Management
ISG strives to employ the brightest, most innovative people in the industry, so that we can provide world class solutions to our clients. Employees at ISG are anchored in our core values, which include trust, integrity, respect, diversity, passion, entrepreneurship, balance and mentorship. 
Our almost 1,300 employees, located in over 20 countries with about one-third in the United States, perform a variety of different roles. We are participants in the competitive research and advisory industries. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in advisory, research and other positions is critical to executing on our strategy. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon a number of factors including learning opportunities, compensation/benefits, work environment and career opportunities. To make this happen, we have certain programs, policies and practices in place including the following:
Diversity/Inclusion
ISG believes a key to our success is our value of diverse backgrounds, experiences and cultures. Our employees function within a collaborative community that welcomes varied ideas and styles. These diverse perspectives produce enhanced results for our clients and result in a preferred place to work.
We exhibit our commitment to diversity and inclusion through our hiring practices, opportunities for learning and advancement and the distribution of rewards. Through efforts, such as our Women-In-Digital industry group, we are able to help in the identification and advancement of diverse talent. While we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation, we seek to continually improve in this area. 
​

ISG WorkLife

9



In 2018, we introduced ISG WorkLife which is a series of progressive, best practice, next-generation HR offerings designed to improve the quality of our work-life experience, while helping us achieve our firm-wide objectives. ISG believes this will help us attract and retain productive talent. Some of the key offerings here include:

● | ISG Cares, our enhanced volunteering program which, among other things, provide employees paid time off to attend to charitable pursuits.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ISG Aspire which is a global mentoring program.
--+------------------------------------------------


● | ISG iTime which provides flexible paid time off arrangements for employees in certain countries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We understand that employees have varied interests both in and outside of the workplace. These programs, and others under ISG WorkLife, provide employees with the opportunity to pursue these activities. These allow us to attract and retain productive employees.
Corporate Social Responsibility 
ISG has a history of various programs, policies and activities which would be considered in the category of corporate social responsibility. In 2020, the firm decided to consolidate these efforts and establish an employee governing body to focus on continued enhancement of these efforts. While the firm already has some robust practices in these areas, we will continue to improve on them and ensure our appropriate development.
Learning
ISG’s success depends on the knowledge and productivity of its employees. To that end, the firm invests a significant amount of time and money into providing development opportunities. Our ISG Academy is robust in offering learning in such topics specific to the employee’s industry and functional areas, leadership and people management, certifications, software and technical skills among others. In 2020, most learning was virtual; our employees completed nearly 20,000 courses, spending over 55,000 hours in doing so. While we hope to reinstate some in-person learning when safe, virtual learning is essential to our efforts. 
COVID-19 Response
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ISG acted swiftly. We immediately articulated our principles which were: 

1. | Ensure all our ISG colleagues and their families are safe.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------


2. | Serve our clients with minimal disruption and be available during these challenging times to assist, support and advise them.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preserve the fundamental financial performance of the firm to support our payroll, investments, and stockholders.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We addressed the principles in that order and we believe faster than many other companies. We began to bring employees back home from clients and settled in for what we thought would be a few weeks of disruption but ultimately lasted longer than anyone expected. We addressed the issues and remained resilient in ensuring employee safety, focused on client needs and preserved our firm’s financial strength.
