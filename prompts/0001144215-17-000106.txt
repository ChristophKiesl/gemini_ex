Industry Overview
Based on industry sources and government information, the Company estimates that in fiscal 2017 the size of the North American lighting and building management solutions market served by the Company (also referred to herein as “addressable market”) was approximately $19 billion and similar to the prior year as the addressable market was estimated to be flat to up low-single digits compared with fiscal 2016. The addressable market includes non-portable luminaires as defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; poles for outdoor lighting; emergency lighting fixtures; daylighting; lighting controls; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) controls; and building management controllers, software, and systems. This market estimate is based on a combination of external industry data and internal estimates, and excludes portable and vehicular lighting fixtures and certain related lighting components, such as lighting ballasts and most lamps. A source of demand for the lighting and building management industry is attributed to the renovation and retrofit of less efficient lighting and building management systems. While the precise size of the North American market is not known, the Company estimates the potential size of the installed base of lighting and building management solutions to be well in excess of $500 billion.
The Company operates in a highly competitive industry that is affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors, such as gross domestic product growth, employment levels, credit availability, energy 
1

costs, and commodity costs. The Company’s market is based on residential and non-residential construction, both new as well as renovation and retrofit activity, which is sensitive to the volatility of these general economic factors. The Company is not aware of any data that accurately quantifies the split of the non-residential lighting market between new construction and renovation and retrofit activity; however, recent trends developed from industry sources and Company estimates suggest that renovation and retrofit activity represents a growing proportion of the total non-residential lighting market. Construction spending on infrastructure projects such as highways, streets, and urban developments has a material impact on the demand for the Company’s infrastructure-focused lighting and building management solutions. Demand for the Company’s lighting and building management solutions sold through certain retail channels is highly dependent on economic drivers, such as consumer spending and discretionary income, along with housing construction and home improvement spending.

In addition, permits and environmental controls are required for certain of the Company’s operations to limit air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation by issuing authorities. On an ongoing basis, the Company allocates resources, including investments in capital and operating costs relating to environmental compliance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years, and federal, state, and local governments domestically and internationally are considering new laws and regulations, including those governing raw material composition, air emissions, end-of-life product dispositions, and energy efficiency. The Company is not aware of any pending legislation or proposed regulation related to environmental issues that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The cost of responding to future changes, however, may be substantial.
Raw Materials
Products produced by the Company require certain raw materials, including certain grades of steel and aluminum, electrical and electronic components, plastics, and other petroleum-based materials and components. In fiscal 2017, the Company purchased approximately 109,000 tons of steel and aluminum. The Company estimates that approximately 7% of purchased raw materials are petroleum-based. Additionally, the Company estimates that approximately five million gallons of diesel fuel were consumed in fiscal 2017 through the Company’s distribution activities. The Company purchases most raw materials and other components on the open market and relies on third parties for providing certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components, and sourced finished goods.
The Company does not currently engage in or expect to engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials, though the Company has and will continue to commit to purchase certain materials for a period of up to 12 months. The Company monitors and investigates alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, and price. The Company currently sources raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but the Company’s ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of its products and services may result in a reduction in the number of its suppliers.
Backlog Orders
The Company produces and stocks quantities of inventory at key distribution centers and warehouses throughout North America and to a much lesser degree, certain European markets. The backlog of orders at any given time is affected by various factors, including seasonality, cancellations, sales promotions, production cycle times, and the timing of receipt and shipment of orders, which are usually shipped within a few weeks of order receipt. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future shipments.

Intellectual Property
The Company owns or has licenses to use various domestic and foreign patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property related to its products, processes, and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors for its businesses. The Company relies on copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws as well as agreements, restrictive covenants, and internal processes and controls to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these protections, unauthorized parties may attempt to infringe on the intellectual property of the Company. As of August 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 1,275 active United States and foreign patents. While patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to the competitive position of the Company, no single patent or patent application is individually material to the Company.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
The Company’s business exhibits some seasonality, with net sales being affected by weather and seasonal demand on construction and installation programs, particularly during the winter months, as well as the annual budget cycles of major customers. Because of these seasonal factors, the Company has experienced, and generally expects to experience, its highest sales in the last two quarters of each fiscal year.
The Company's lighting and building management solutions are sold to customers in both the new construction as well as renovation and retrofit markets for residential and non-residential applications. The construction market is cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions. Sales volume has a major impact on the profitability of the Company. Economic downturns and the potential decline in key construction markets may have a material adverse effect on the net sales and operating income of the Company.
Employees
As of August 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 12,500 associates, of which approximately 4,000 were employed in the United States, approximately 8,000 in Mexico, and approximately 500 in other international locations, including Europe, Canada, and the Asia/Pacific region. Union recognition and collective bargaining arrangements are in place or in process, covering approximately 9,500 persons (including approximately 2,000 in the United States). Union recognition and collective bargaining arrangements covering approximately 7,000 persons will expire within the next fiscal year, primarily due to annual negotiations with unions in Mexico. The remaining expiring arrangements relate to approximately 500 persons employed within the United States. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees.
