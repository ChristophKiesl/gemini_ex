     Item 1. Business
     General development of the business
     Calavo Growers, Inc. (Calavo, the Company, we, us or our), is a global leader in the avocado industry and an expanding provider of value-added fresh food.  Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocados, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to retail grocery, foodservice, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers on a worldwide basis.  We procure avocados from California, Mexico and other growing regions around the world.  Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) create, process and package a portfolio of healthy fresh foods including fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables and prepared foods and (iii) process and package guacamole and salsa.  We distribute our products both domestically and internationally and report our operations in three different business segments:  Fresh products, Calavo Foods and Renaissance Food Group (“RFG”).  See Note 11 in our consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments.  Our principal executive offices are located at 1141-A Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060; telephone (805) 525-1245.  
     On October 9, 2001, we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of Calavo Growers of California (the Cooperative), an agricultural marketing cooperative association, exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock.  Concurrent with this transaction, the Cooperative was merged into us with Calavo Growers, Inc. (Calavo) emerging as the surviving entity.  These transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non-profit cooperative to a for-profit corporation.  

     In December 2014, Calavo formed a wholly owned subsidiary Calavo Growers de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Calavo Sub).  In July 2015, Calavo Sub entered into a Shareholder Agreement with Grupo Belo del Pacifico, S.A. de C.V., (Belo) a Mexican Company owned by Agricola Belher, and formed Agricola Don Memo, S.A. de C.V. (“Don Memo” or “ADM”). Belo and Calavo Sub have an equal one-half ownership interest in Don Memo in exchange for $2 million each.  Pursuant to a management service agreement, Belo, through its officers and employees, has day-to-day power and authority to manage the operations. Belo is entitled to a management fee, as defined, which is payable annually in July of each year.  Additionally, Calavo Sub is entitled to commission, for the sale of produce in the Mexican National Market, United States, Canada, and any other overseas market. 
     In August 2015, we entered into Shareholder’s Agreement with various partners and created Avocados de Jalisco, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“Avocados de Jalisco” or “ADJ”).  Avocados de Jalisco is a Mexican corporation created to engage in procuring, packing and selling avocados.  This entity is approximately 80% owned by Calavo and is consolidated in our financial statements.  Avocados de Jalisco built a new packinghouse located in Jalisco, Mexico which commenced operations in the fiscal third quarter of 2017.
     In fiscal 2016, we expanded and refurbished our plant facilities in Houston, TX and Jacksonville, FL to add additional capacity and in-plant capabilities. We invested approximately $7.3 million into the Houston facility and $13.3 million into the Jacksonville facility.  
     On November 1, 2016, we acquired certain real property, consisting of land, a refrigerated building and select production and office equipment located at 1730 Eastridge Avenue, Riverside, California from Fresh Foods, LLC for total consideration of approximately $19.4 million.  We intend to operate the refrigerated facility as part of our network of USDA and organic certified fresh food facilities.

     Fresh products
     Calavo was founded in 1924 to market California avocados.  We now sell avocados sourced from a variety of locations (including but not limited to California, Mexico, and Peru) to a diverse group of retail grocers, foodservice operators, club stores, mass merchandisers, food distributors and wholesalers, under the Calavo family of brand labels, as well as private labels.  From time to time, some of our larger customers seek short-term sales contracts that formalize their pricing and volume requirements.  Generally, these contracts contain provisions that establish a price floor and/or ceiling during the contract duration.  In our judgment, the shift by our customers to requiring sales contracts as well as their desire for more consistent year round supply requiring multiple sourcing location benefit large handlers like us, which have the ability to fulfill the terms of these contracts. We believe we have developed strong long-term relationships with our customers that provides a solid base for our business. During fiscal year 2017, our 5 and 25 largest fresh customers represented approximately 18% and 39% of our total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal year 2016, our 5 and 25 largest fresh products customers represented approximately 15% and 36% of our total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 none of our fresh customers represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues. 
     The Hass variety is the predominant avocado variety marketed on a worldwide basis.  In California, the growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County.  Generally, California grown Hass avocados are available year-round, with peak production periods occurring from April through August.  In Mexico, we procure fruit from the growing regions of Uruapan Michoacán, Mexico and Jalisco, Mexico.  The Mexican avocado harvest is year-round (though generally most significant from September to June in Michoacán and from June to January for Jalisco). Other significant harvest areas from which we have sourced, or from which we may source, avocados include Peru, Chile and Colombia.  The storage life of fresh avocados (once picked from the tree) is limited, typically ranging from one to four weeks depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used, and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
     Avocados delivered to our packinghouses are graded, sized, packed and cooled. The actual size and timing of the delivery of the annual avocado crop, has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit. To that end, our field personnel maintain direct contact with growers and farm managers and coordinate harvest plans. The feedback from our field-managers is used by our sales department to prepare sales plans used by our direct sales force.  The process by which avocados are purchased from growers differs slightly across our different sourcing regions.  In California, avocado growers are provided daily field quotes, on a per pound basis, for most fruit.  These quotes are based on the variety, size, and grade of California avocados and are calculated based on our expectations of how much we believe we will sell the fruit for, less our anticipated costs and our desired margin. Ultimately, we pay/settle with our California growers once a month.  The purchase price we pay for fruit acquired from Mexican growers is generally negotiated for substantially all the fruit in a particular grove, by bloom.  The Mexican avocado crop will typically have three to four blooms in a single year. Once a purchase price is tentatively agreed to, the fruit is then harvested and delivered to our packinghouses located in Mexico. We also purchase fruit directly from third-party Mexican packers as supplemental source and is packed to our standards for shipment to either our customers’ or our operating facilities. Peruvian, Chilean and Colombian avocados are primarily handled on a commission basis, which is usually calculated as a percentage of the overall selling price.
     Apart from the cost of fruit, significant portions of our avocado handling costs are fixed. As a result, significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have a considerable impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. As a result of our investment in 

 
  4

packinghouse equipment, distribution centers with value-added ripening and packing capabilities and personnel, we believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado crops. We believe that our continued success in marketing avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We are subject to USDA and other regulatory inspections to ensure the safety and the quality of the fruit being delivered.  
     We have also developed a series of value-added programs that are designed to differentiate our products and services from those offered by our competitors.  Some of these key programs are as follows:
    
· | Value-Added Ripening: We continue to have success with our ProRipeVIP™ avocado ripening program. This proprietary program allows us to deliver avocados ~evenly ripened to our customers’ specifications. We have invested in TasteTech Near Infrared (NIR) technology and equipment. The most significant reason we invested in the TasteTech systems is because the NIR technology measures internal qualities of the entire piece of fruit, as opposed to competitive mechanical tests that use pressure and calculated averages to measure firmness. We believe that ripened avocados help our customers address the consumers' immediate needs and accelerate the sale of avocados through their stores. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Value-Added Packaging: We have developed various display techniques and packages that appeal to consumers and, in particular, impulse buyers. Some of our techniques include the bagging of avocados and the strategic display of the bags within the produce section of retail stores. Our research has demonstrated that consumers generally purchase a larger quantity of avocados when presented in a bag as opposed to the conventional bulk displays. We also believe that the value proposition of avocados in a bag provides for a higher level of sales to grocery stores.

      The avocado market is highly competitive with over one hundred U.S. avocado marketers and/or importers, such as Calavo, seeking to source avocados from over 20,000 independent avocado growers worldwide. Based on the information we have from various industry sources, we believe that Calavo is consistently among the largest avocado marketers in the US from a volume, sales and profitability perspective.  We attribute our solid position as one of the top avocado distributors to the competitiveness of the per pound returns we pay and the communication and service we maintain with our growers.  In addition, we believe our diversified, product assortment, consistent product quality and value-added programs provide us with a competitive advantage in servicing retail and foodservice customers.
     Our Fresh business segment also markets and distributes select other perishable food products such as tomatoes and papayas (“Other Fresh Products”).  Tomatoes are primarily handled on a consigned basis, while papayas are handled on a pooling basis, generally at a fixed fee per papaya delivered.  Sales of our Other Fresh Products generally experience fluctuations related to seasonality.  We believe our efforts in distributing our other various types of fruit complement our offerings of avocados.
     Calavo Foods
     The Calavo Foods segment was originally conceived as a mechanism to stabilize the price of California avocados by reducing the volume of fresh, whole avocados available to the marketplace.  In the 1960's and early 1970's, we pioneered the process of freezing avocado pulp and developed a wide variety of guacamole recipes to address the diverse tastes of consumers and buyers in both the retail and foodservice industries.  One of the key benefits of frozen products is their relatively longer shelf-life.  With the introduction of low cost processed products delivered from Mexican based processors and the growing customer demand for more prepared avocado products we shifted the fruit procurement and pulp processing functions of our Foods segment to Mexico.  
     We utilize ultra-high pressure technology equipment, which is designed to protect and safeguard foods without the need of preservatives on all of our prepared avocado and guacamole products.  This procedure substantially destroys the cells of any bacteria that could lead to spoilage, food safety, or oxidation issues without affecting the taste profile of the finished product.  Once the procedure is complete, our packaged guacamole can be frozen to ensure a longer shelf-life or shipped fresh to various retail, club, and foodservice customers throughout the markets we service in the U.S and abroad.  While the overwhelming majority of our Calavo Foods products are produced in our Uruapan, Mexico

production facility, we also utilize high-quality co-packers (using similar ultra-high pressure technology) from time-to-time, as we did in fiscal year 2017, to produce several of our retail and foodservice products. 
      For fiscal 2018, we believe our capacity will be sufficient for our expected growth due to a combination of production-enhancing initiatives at our facility and the further development of our network of co-packers.  Net sales of our fresh, refrigerated (non-frozen) products, typically sold to retail customers, represented approximately 53% and 50% of total guacamole sales within the Calavo Foods segment for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016.  
     Sales in the U.S. and Canada are made principally through a commissioned nationwide broker network, which is supported by our regional sales managers.  We believe that our marketing strength is distinguished by providing quality products, innovation, year-round product availability, strategically located warehouses, and market relationships.  During fiscal year 2017, our 5 and 25 largest Calavo Foods customers represented approximately 3% and 6% of our total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal year 2016, our 5 and 25 largest processed product customers represented approximately 3% and 6% of our total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 none of our processed product customers represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues.
     RFG
     Acquired in June of 2011, Renaissance Food Group is a leader in the fast-growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category.  RFG creates, markets, and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers via the retail channel, including national and regional supermarkets, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores, and specialty/natural retailers.  As a leader in refrigerated fresh packaged foods, RFG utilizes a network of company-operated and independently-operated USDA and organic certified fresh food facilities strategically located across the U.S.  These facilities allow RFG to offer national retailers high quality, refrigerated fresh foods that can be delivered within hours from time of production.  Consumer demand is high for quality refrigerated fresh packaged foods and RFG’s speed to market, product innovation and broad product range positions the Company well to serve retailers addressing this consumer trend.  RFG products include fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entrée salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and various deli items, meals kits and related components and salad kits.  RFG products are marketed under the Garden Highway Fresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials brands, as well as store-brand, private label programs. Backed by Calavo’s resources, the business unit continues to expand its footprint in the retail grocery channel.
      During fiscal year 2017, our 5 and 25 largest RFG product customers represented approximately 29% and 39% of our total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal year 2016, our 5 and 25 largest RFG product customers represented approximately 25% and 36% of our total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, RFG had one customer that represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues.  During fiscal year 2015, none of our RFG product customers represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues.

 Working Capital Requirements
     Generally, we make payments to our avocado growers and other suppliers in advance of collecting all of the related accounts receivable.  We generally bridge the timing between vendor payments and customer receipts by using operating cash flows and commercial bank borrowings.  In addition, we provide crop loans and other advances to some of our growers, which are also funded through operating cash flows and borrowings.  
     Non-California sourced avocados and other perishable food products often require working capital to finance the payment of advances to suppliers and collection of accounts receivable.  These working capital needs are also financed through the use of operating cash flows and bank borrowings.
     With respect to our Calavo Foods and RFG segments, we require working capital to finance the production of our prepared food products, building and maintaining an adequate supply of finished product, and collecting our accounts receivable balances.  These working capital needs are financed through the use of operating cash flows and bank borrowings.
     Backlog
     Our customers do not place product orders significantly in advance of the requested product delivery dates.  Customers typically order perishable products one to ten days in advance of shipment, and typically order Calavo Foods within thirty days in advance of shipment.     Research and Development
     Prior to the acquisition of RFG, we did not undertake significant research and development efforts. Research and development programs, if any, were limited to the continuous process of refining and developing new techniques to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our Calavo Foods operations and the handling, ripening, storage, and packing of fresh avocados.  With the acquisition of RFG, however, we have increased research and development for new and improved products which is driven by customer requests, changes in product specifications, customer and market research and/or innovative ideas generated by our own team of experts with food processing and culinary backgrounds.  We solicit customer and supplier input, review process and product trends and conduct sensory and shelf life testing, all to expand the category and drive new sales for our customers.  Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.  Total research and development costs for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were less than $0.1 million.      Compliance with Government Regulations
     As a manufacturer and marketer of consumable products, our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the USDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as state and local agencies, with respect to production processes, product attributes, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution. Under various statutes and regulations, these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety, purity and labeling.  In addition, advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC, and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  Our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities. In addition, we are subject to Mexican regulations through the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food/Plant Protection.
     The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees the packing and processing of California avocados and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards.  All of our packages are stamped with the state seal as meeting standards.  Various states have instituted regulations providing differing levels of oversight with respect to weights and measures, as well as quality standards.

 As a result of our agricultural and food processing activities, we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties.
     We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance.  We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses.  
     Employees
     As of October 31, 2017, we had 2,516 employees, of which 954 were located in the United States and 1,562 were located in Mexico.  We do not have a significant number of United States employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Approximately 1,300 of Calavo's Mexican employees are represented by a union. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good and we have never experienced a significant work stoppage. 
     The following is a summary of the number of "salaried" and "hourly" employees as of October 31, 2017.
    
Location | Salaried | Hourly | Total
United States | 365 | 589 | 954
