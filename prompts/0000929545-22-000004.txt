ITEM 1. BUSINESS

References to the “Company”, “we,” “our,” and “us,” refer to Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc., including, as the context requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The descriptions of the Company in this Part I are as of the filing date of this Form 10-K.

Overview

Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc. was incorporated in Virginia on August 23, 1994 and was reincorporated in Maryland on November 19, 2014. Our common stock began trading on October 30, 1996 and most recently traded under the symbol “CDOR” on the NYSE American stock exchange (the “Exchange”). As the Company would no longer meet continued listing requirements of the Exchange upon the substantial liquidation dividend distribution on December 30, 2021 (see below under “Special Dividend Liquidation Distribution”) and after consultation with the Exchange, on December 10, 2021, the Company, in accordance with the authority granted by the Company’s board of directors, provided written notice to the Exchange of its intention to voluntarily delist its common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Common Stock”), on the Exchange. The Company filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Exchange relating to the delisting of the Common Stock on December 20, 2021, with the trading of its Common Stock on the Exchange suspended on December 31, 2021. The official delisting of the Common Stock was effective on December 31, 2021.

The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes that previously specialized in the investment and ownership of high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned no properties pursuant to the Hotel Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Plan of Liquidation as discussed below.

We were engaged primarily in the business of owning equity interests in hotel properties and therefore our business is disclosed as one reportable segment. See the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information required in this Item 1.




Hotel Purchase and Sale Agreement

On June 21, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors (the “Company Board”) is evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Following unanimous approval by the Company Board, on September 22, 2021, the Company and B9 Cowboy Mezz A LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners (the “Buyer”), entered into a Hotel Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Buyer will acquire Company’s portfolio of 15 hotels (the “Portfolio”) for a cash purchase price of $305.0 million (the “Portfolio Sale”), subject to certain credits and adjustments. At a special shareholder meeting (the “Special Stockholder Meeting”) commenced on November 12, 2021, the Portfolio Sale was approved by the Company shareholders.

On November 19, 2021, the Company completed the Portfolio Sale, and received cash proceeds, net of payment of related expenses and the repayment of the Company’s debt, totaling approximately $113.9 million.

Plan of Liquidation

On September 20, 2021 the Company Board unanimously approved a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation”) pursuant to which the Company would be liquidated and dissolved, subject to approval of the Plan of Liquidation (the “Liquidation Proposal”), including the liquidation and dissolution of the Company pursuant thereto, by the Company’s shareholders at the Special Stockholder Meeting. At the Special Stockholder Meeting completed on December 1, 2021, the Liquidation Proposal was approved by Company shareholders. Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and in accordance with the applicable provisions of law, the Company is authorized to do all other things reasonably necessary or advisable to complete the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. The Company is not required to obtain any further shareholder approval with respect to the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. Under the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board may modify, amend or abandon the Plan of Liquidation, notwithstanding shareholder approval, to the extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”). The Company has no present plans or intentions to modify, amend or abandon the Plan of Liquidation.
Special Dividend Liquidation Distribution

In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board approved a special dividend liquidation distribution of $7.94 per share of Common Stock to its stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 27, 2021. The special dividend liquidation distribution was paid on December 30, 2021. Upon completion of the winding-up process and dissolution, if any funds remain, such funds will be distributed to shareholders.
Structure and Tax Status

We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, in which our hotel properties were owned by our operating partnership, Condor Hospitality Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries (the “operating partnership”), for which we serve as general partner. As of December 31, 2021, we owned an approximate 99.9% ownership interest in the operating partnership. 

In order for the income from our hotel property investments to constitute “rents from real properties” for purposes of the gross income tests required by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for REIT qualification, the income we earn cannot be derived from the operation of any of our hotels. Therefore, the operating partnership and its subsidiaries leased our hotel properties to the Company’s wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, TRS Leasing, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“the TRS”). The TRS in turn engaged third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels. Our independent management companies are not affiliated with us or our management team. The operating partnership, the TRS, and their respective subsidiaries are consolidated into the Company’s financial statements. 

The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), as amended. In general, under such Code provisions, a trust which has made the required election and, in the taxable year, meets certain requirements and distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of the income currently distributed to shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will be unable to re-elect REIT status until the 

 


fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT, unless we satisfy certain relief provisions. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the TRS, which is taxed as a C-Corporation, is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. 

Employees

At December 31, 2021, the Company had one employee.
