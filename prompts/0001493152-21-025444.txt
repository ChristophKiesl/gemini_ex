OUR STRATEGY
 
We believe that we have been effective at value creation during the more than 30 years since our founding. We have incubated promising early-stage, high-growth businesses with investment capital provided by our more mature, cash-generating businesses. As these growth businesses scale, we have frequently monetized them through sales or spin-offs to our shareholders.
 
To date, we have spun off five publicly traded companies, one of which was subsequently acquired:
 

■ | IDW Media Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: IDW), a publishing and entertainment company (2009); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Genie Energy, Ltd. (NYSE: GNE), a retail energy provider in the United States and Europe and developer of solar energy projects (2011); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Straight Path Communications, Inc. a holder of certain spectrum licenses that was purchased by Verizon in 2018 (2015); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Zedge, Inc. (NYSE American: ZDGE), an app developer focused on mobile phone personalization and entertainment (2016); and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Rafael Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RFL), a pharmaceutical company pursuing novel cancer therapies (2018). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Today, we are comprised of several high-growth, high-margin, tech-centric businesses as well as more mature businesses. Our businesses derive their competitive advantages leveraging one or more of our strategic assets including:
 

■ | The BOSS Revolution, net2phone and NRS brands; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | A nationwide network of more than 35,000 retailers who sell BOSS Revolution offerings including over 26,000 who utilize our digital retailer platform; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Our customer base of more than eight million, primarily in immigrant communities within the United States; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Our technology, global infrastructure and high-capacity transaction platforms; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Extensive VoIP and cloud services expertise; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Our staff of more than 1,600 working in over 20 countries on four continents. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our high-margin, high-growth businesses include:
 

■ | net2phone, a UCaaS provider that intelligently integrates cloud communications across channels, platforms and devices for businesses globally; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, a U.S. provider of international money remittances through digital and retail channels; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | NRS, an operator of a POS terminal-based network that enables independent retailers to operate and process transactions more effectively while providing advertisers and consumer marketers unprecedented reach into underserved consumer markets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the development of these three businesses, growth capital has been provided by the cash flows generated by our more mature traditional communications offerings. Consequently, we did not have to utilize debt financing nor dilutive capital raises to fund the growth of these initiatives.
 
Our mature, traditional communications offerings include:
 

■ | Mobile Top-Up; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


■ | BOSS Revolution Calling; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Carrier Services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our traditional communications offerings participate wholly or partially in the paid minute voice communications market. This market is subject to intense revenue and margin pressure as consumers migrate to free over-the-top voice and messaging services as well as flat-rate international long-distance plans. However, we continually innovate and deploy new features and enhancements to generate revenue and reduce overhead and operating expenditures for each of these offerings. Most notably, our Mobile Top-Up offerings have defied market trends to expand significantly in recent years. In addition, BOSS Revolution Calling’s and Mobile Top-Up’s margin contributions have both benefited from a gradual rotation to digital channels with higher per-unit margins. These trends and cost saving efforts have, in recent quarters, more than offset the revenue and margin contribution pressures of the paid minute voice communications market.
 
The increasing revenue and gross margin contributions from our high-margin growth businesses in combination with our efforts to maximize the cash generation of our lower margin, more mature offerings have enabled us to improve our consolidated bottom-line performance in recent quarters. We expect that this rotation toward our higher margin offerings will continue and help to drive increases in our net margins.
 
In fiscal 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had directed us to prepare for the potential spin-off of our net2phone cloud communications business. Management subsequently has stated that it expects the preparations will be complete by the end of calendar year 2021 or shortly thereafter, although there is no assurance that this spin-off will be completed on this schedule or at all.
 
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
Fintech
 
Our Fintech segment contributed 5% and 4% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, and is comprised of:
 

■ | NRS, an operator of a nationwide POS network providing payment processing, digital advertising, transaction data, and ancillary services; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, a provider of international money remittance and related value/payment transfer services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During fiscal 2021, our Fintech segment generated $74.3 million in revenues and a loss from operations of $1.5 million, as compared with revenues of $59.9 million and income from operations of $3.4 million in fiscal 2020.
 
NRS
 
NRS’ revenues were $24.7 million in fiscal 2021, a 107% increase from fiscal 2020.
 
NRS operates a network of POS terminals at independent retailers throughout the United States. The NRS solution includes hardware and software components that are specifically integrated to enable these retailers to compete more effectively against typically larger retail chains.
 
The POS terminal’s hardware includes cash registers, barcode scanners, retailer and customer-facing hi-definition screens, receipt printers and credit card readers. NRS’ integrated, proprietary software is offered as a service and provides operational tools including inventory management, sales tracking, price book management and other useful features.
 
The primary market for NRS’ POS terminals is the more than 200,000 independently owned convenience, liquor, grocery, and tobacco stores in the United States, many of which primarily serve foreign-born communities.

NRS continues to increase the number of POS terminals active in its network. As of July 31, 2021, the NRS POS network included more than 14,000 terminals, an increase from 10,000 a year earlier. NRS’ POS terminal sales and marketing is targeted, in part, to our nationwide network of BOSS Revolution retailers. NRS also has strategic relationships with more than 100 wholesale distributors including some of the largest cash-and-carry wholesalers in the United States.
 
NRS generates revenue from a portfolio of services for both retailers and third parties:
 

■ | Terminals and terminal-based software services: NRS’ services for retailers include the provision of POS terminals. Terminals are typically offered at a discount from the full retail price when buyers enroll in NRS’ payment processing service, NRS PAY. Terminal operators pay a monthly software service fee starting at $24.95 per terminal and increasing with premium POS feature sets. NRS technology teams based in the United States and Israel develop new functionality and feature sets that we believe enable NRS to expand its target market to new retail segments. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Merchant Services: The substantial majority of merchant services revenue is generated by NRS PAY, which enables retailers to accept and process payments made by credit cards, debit cards, and electronic benefits transfer. NRS PAY’s pricing model does not require a contract, provides the NRS equipment for free, and does not charge hidden fees. Instead, NRS charges a flat, transparent rate per transaction. At July 31, 2021, we had over 5,600 NRS PAY customers including more than 1,250 customers added during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Display Advertising: NRS terminals feature 15” high-definition customer-facing screens designed to engage customers during check-out. The screens enable consumer package-good sellers and other marketers to offer coupons, deals, and promotions on in-store products through static and video advertisements with reach into urban demographic segments. NRS’ advertising offerings participate in the digital out-of-home, or DOOH, advertising market. DOOH is among the fastest growing advertising market segments. As it matures, we expect that the DOOH market will become increasingly accessible to programmatic advertising buyers, which would enable NRS to significantly increase advertising sales. At July 31, 2021, NRS had a DOOH network capacity of approximately 13.2 billion impressions per year. NRS sold approximately 9% of its available impression capacity in fiscal 2021. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Data Analytics: NRS captures targeted, daily POS data from independent retailers. These retailers are concentrated in urban communities with significant immigrant populations and, in the aggregate, constitute a significant but largely underserved market for data analysis. NRS has built a data platform that allows third parties to analyze purchasing trends at independent retailers and gain insights into this important segment of the consumer market. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The NRS business supports our BOSS Revolution communications and payment offerings - BOSS Revolution Calling, BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, and Mobile Top-Up, all of which can be sold and provisioned by retailers directly from their NRS terminals.
 
We believe that NRS’ competitive advantages include:
 

■ | A combination of hardware and software specifically designed to meet the unique store-management needs of independent retailers; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | An engaging 15” hi-definition customer-facing screen at the POS terminal for advertising and promotions; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Focus on urban markets with high concentrations of first- and second-generation immigrants that provides advertisers and marketers with valuable reach and insight into previously relatively opaque communities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Partnerships to enroll customers through cash-and-carry wholesale distributors including Jetro; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | For NRS PAY, simplified, transparent pricing with free card readers, no hidden fees and lower total cost to operate than most competitors; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | For NRS PAY, continued conversion of NRS terminal customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-

 

NRS’ growth strategy includes:
 

■ | Conversion of current BOSS Revolution retailers to NRS POS and NRS PAY; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | For NRS PAY, conversion of current NRS terminal customers, particularly as contracts expire; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Expansion into new retail markets; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | New POS features and functionality; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Further integration with programmatic advertisers; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Expanding NRS’ internal advertising sales force 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Creation of a consumer app; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Adding provisioning and supply capabilities to NRS’ salesforce. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
NRS competes against several nationwide POS companies that primarily service other retail store segments, but also service NRS’ target market of independent convenience, liquor, and tobacco stores in the United States. These companies include, among others, Square, Clover, and NCR. We believe that NRS has a competitive advantage because other nationwide POS companies do not offer the complete suite of services that NRS has tailored to the specific needs of independent retailers. In addition, we believe that these competitors do not have NRS’ focus and marketing reach into these independent stores, often in immigrant communities, where many retailers have established relationships with us and sell our BOSS Revolution offerings.
 
NRS also competes with smaller, regional POS companies that focus on convenience stores. However, these regional players generally do not offer a comparable suite of POS services, have limited capacity to scale their platforms, and/or are not price competitive.
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer revenues were $49.6 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 3% from fiscal 2020.
 
International money remittance is a significant economic activity among our target market of foreign-born communities in the United States. Our BOSS Revolution Money Transfer business enables our customers in the United States to remit money to third parties in destinations worldwide. The service is offered directly to consumers via our digital channel including the BOSS Revolution Money app and the BOSS Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com) and through our retail channel comprising licensed BOSS Revolution authorized money transfer agents nationwide.
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer’s digital channel is its largest and fastest growing digital channel. During fiscal 2021, over three-quarters of BOSS Revolution Money Transfer’s transactions originated on our digital channels, predominantly in the BOSS Revolution Money app. The Money app enables customers with a debit or credit card to send money transfers easily and securely directly from their iOS or Android device. In addition, we have recently added the Money Transfer service within our BOSS Revolution Calling app.
 
We continue to expand our BOSS Revolution Money Transfer customer base by focusing our marketing efforts on converting the large BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up customer bases, as well as bringing in new customers directly, primarily through attractive fee and foreign exchange rate offers, to both our direct-to-consumer and retail channels.
 
We also continue to focus on sales through our nationwide network of BOSS Revolution Money Transfer agents.
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer leverages the BOSS Revolution retail network to afford unbanked and underbanked customers the ability to initiate transactions with cash. In order to provide our remittance service, BOSS Revolution retailers must meet certain financial and other regulatory qualifications. To date, only a small fraction of BOSS Revolution retailers have been authorized to offer money transfer services. Our internal sales force recruits new money transfer agents to expand our origination network, and we continue to enhance our retail money transfer portal to facilitate adoption and utilization of the money transfer offering by BOSS Revolution retailers.
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer’s payment network now includes 306,000 payout locations in 37 countries. In addition, remittances are offered to mobile wallets in some destinations.
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer generates revenues from a per-transaction fee charged to the customer and from foreign exchange differentials. Our transaction costs include commissions paid to the retail agent, payment to the international disbursing agent, banking, compliance, foreign currency exchange costs and, in the case of direct-to-consumer transfers, credit and debit card processing fees.

Competitive strengths
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer competes in the international money remittance space with both ‘brick and mortar’ services which operate primarily in retail locations though owned stores or authorized agents and a growing number of digital-only platforms. Most retailer-based originators of money transfer have now developed digital capabilities as well. Publicly traded companies in this category include Western Union, International Money Express, Inc (Intermex), Ria, a subsidiary of Euronet Worldwide, and MoneyGram International, Inc. Money remittance providers that compete wholly or primarily through digital channels include Xoom (a subsidiary of PayPal), WorldRemit, Remitly, TransferWise and many others.
 
We believe that BOSS Revolution Money Transfer’s competitive strengths include:
 

■ | BOSS Revolution is an established and trusted brand that has served immigrant communities in the United States for over a decade. We spend significantly on BOSS Revolution branded marketing to support BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Revolution Money Transfer. Through the nationwide network of over 35,000 BOSS Revolution retailers, the BOSS Revolution brand has a high-visibility storefront presence in many communities with significant immigrant populations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | The BOSS Revolution Money app, which originates most of our money transfers, is a proprietary, internally developed, scalable platform that has earned high marks from customers for its ease of use, reliability, and customer service. As of October 1, 2021, the app enjoyed a favorable 4.8 rating (on a scale of 1-5) on the Apple App Store with over 26,000 reviews, and 4.6 rating in Google Play with over 30,000 reviews. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Our nationwide retail channel enables underbanked and unbanked customers to initiate transactions with cash at BOSS Revolution Money retailers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Its comprehensive compliance processes and procedures. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Its experienced management team. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer’s growth strategy includes:
 

■ | Expansion of its payout network; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Expansion of origination beyond the United States to Canada and United Kingdom and other European countries with large immigrant populations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Conversion of BOSS Revolution Calling and Mobile Top-Up customers to BOSS Revolution Money Transfer; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Continued enhancement to its retailer portal; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Increase the number of its retail agents; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Addition of new services and offerings. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
BOSS Revolution Money Transfer competes against traditional international money transfer services with established retail and disbursement networks including Western Union, MoneyGram, Intermex, and Ria, as well as many niche money transfer organizations that serve specific destination corridors. Our direct-to-consumer channel competes with these operators as well as digital only entrants including Xoom, Wise, Remitly, and World-Remit that are disrupting the retailer-based money transfer market. We continue to compete successfully in part by migrating customers from our other BOSS Revolution offerings to BOSS Revolution Money Transfer leveraging our well-regarded BOSS Revolution brand, insights into our customers, and our cross-marketing capabilities. We compete for customers outside the BOSS Revolution ecosystem primarily based on brand reputation, low fees, and competitive foreign exchange rates.

Competition
 
Major competitors to net2phone-UCaaS’ offerings include other UCaaS providers such as RingCentral, 8x8, and Vonage, as well as numerous privately held companies such as Nextiva. Many of these companies offer more widely recognized brands, larger and more developed marketing and sales forces and/or channel agent networks, and more advanced product sets such as services designed specifically for call centers, messaging and chat, and solutions customized for specific market segments or verticals. These competitors’ offerings typically also support integration of their services with other well-known, third-party CRM vendors as well as with various Google and Microsoft applications.
Traditional Communications
 
Our Traditional Communications segment, which represented 92% and 93% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, includes:
 

■ | Mobile Top-Up, which enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging, and data to international and domestic mobile accounts; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | BOSS Revolution Calling, an international long-distance calling service marketed primarily to immigrant communities in the United States and Canada; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Carrier Services, a wholesale provider of international voice and SMS termination and outsourced traffic management solutions to telecoms worldwide; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Other, small businesses and offerings including early-stage business initiatives and mature businesses in harvest mode. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During fiscal 2021, Traditional Communications generated $1,329 million in revenues and income from operations of $80.0 million, as compared with revenues of $1,254 million and income from operations of $38.9 million in fiscal 2020.
 
Mobile Top-Up
 
Mobile Top-Up’s revenues were $461.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $334.4 million in fiscal 2020 (34.7% and 26.7% of Traditional Communications’ revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively).
 
Mobile Top-Up enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging, and data to recharge or ‘top-up’ mobile phone accounts internationally (International Mobile Top-Up, or IMTU) and domestically (Domestic Mobile Top-Up, or DMTU). Mobile Top-Up leverages our platform capabilities, our distribution reach into foreign-born communities and our relationships with mobile operators around the world.

IMTU and DMTU are sold under the BOSS Revolution brand through the BOSS Revolution digital platforms, including our BOSS Revolution Calling and BOSS Revolution Money apps. Mobile Top-Up is also sold through our retail network including provisioning directly by retailers using our digital retailer platform and through mobile operator-branded top-up cards. We offer Mobile Top-Up for approximately 155 different carriers in 95 countries, primarily in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. The substantial majority of Mobile Top-Up’s revenue is generated by the sale of IMTU.
 
We plan to grow Mobile Top-Up via continued growth in the United States and worldwide, expansion into the wholesale market segment and the addition of new payment products.
 
Competition
 
The major competitors to Mobile Top-Up include:
 

■ | international mobile operators, who seek to control more of their own distribution channel or create their own products that directly compete with our Mobile Top-Up; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | other service providers, distributors, and wholesalers, who develop a more comprehensive product offering than our Mobile Top-Up or aggressively discount their product offerings. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the competitive advantages of Mobile Top-Up are:
 

■ | our direct connection to most of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 mobile carriers worldwide that improve margins and innovation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | access via stores and apps to the United States, which is the biggest and wealthiest diaspora market in the world; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our strong omni channel approach, which includes our retail partners, directly through our apps and website, and the wholesale channel. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOSS Revolution Calling
 
BOSS Revolution Calling’s revenues were $455.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $468.3 million in fiscal 2020 (34.3% and 37.3% of Traditional Communications’ revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively).
 
BOSS Revolution Calling is a prepaid international long-distance calling service marketed primarily to foreign-born and under-banked consumers in the United States and Canada, and digital only offering in Europe and Australia.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling includes our flagship ‘BOSS Revolution’ branded international long-distance prepaid calling service as well as disposable hard cards sold under a variety of brands. In the United States, BOSS Revolution Calling serves, as of July 31, 2021, approximately 2.8 million customers per month.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling is offered both through our extensive national network of BOSS Revolution retailers and through our digital channel - the BOSS Revolution Calling app (for iOS and Android) and website.
 
The majority of our customers purchase BOSS Revolution Calling through our nationwide network of BOSS Revolution retailers. At July 31, 2021, approximately 26,000 retailers per month utilized our digital retailer platform to provision customers, the substantial majority of whom pay the retailer in cash. In addition, we estimate that approximately 9,000 retailers resell our disposable hard cards without utilizing our retailer portal. BOSS Revolution retailers are typically independent retailers serving foreign-born communities with significant unbanked or under-banked populations.
 
Usage of our BOSS Revolution Calling app has been growing consistently. At July 31, 2021, approximately 1.5 million customers per month utilized the BOSS Revolution Calling app.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling allows users to place international long-distance calls at affordable rates from the BOSS Revolution Calling app or by calling an access number. Regardless of how the call originates, our customers must first establish and top-up a prepaid BOSS Revolution account that is linked to their phone. Once the account is established and a call is placed, our platform recognizes the customer’s phone through its network-provided automatic number identification and seamlessly links each call to the corresponding BOSS Revolution account. Callers then enter their destination phone numbers. BOSS Revolution Calling customers’ account balances are debited at a fixed rate per minute or at a fixed amount for calling plans to a specific country over a specified time period. In contrast to certain of our competitors, BOSS Revolution Calling does not charge connection, usage or breakage fees. BOSS Revolution Calling’s per minute rates vary by the destination country, city, and whether the call is placed to a landline or mobile phone. Rates are published on the BOSS Revolution consumer website and within the BOSS Revolution Calling app.

Customers can open a BOSS Revolution Calling account for free and top-up with a debit or credit card using the BOSS Revolution Calling app, the BOSS Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com) or phone, or with cash at any BOSS Revolution retailer.
 
In the United States, we distribute our BOSS Revolution Calling hard cards and other retail products primarily through our network of distributors that, either directly or through sub-distributors, sell to retail locations. In addition, our internal sales force sells BOSS Revolution Calling and other platform products directly to retailers. Distributors, our internal salespeople, and retailers receive commissions based on the revenue generated by each transaction or on a per-transaction basis, depending on the product.
 
The BOSS Revolution digital retailer platform can be accessed by a computer or by Android and iOS smartphones and enables retailers to create accounts for new customers, add funds to existing customer balances and execute sales transactions. It provides a direct, real-time interface with our BOSS Revolution retailers, resulting in a cost-effective and adaptable distribution model that allows us to target and promote services directly to distributors and retailers, to introduce and cross-sell new offerings, and to rapidly respond to changes in the business environment.
 
In the United States, the BOSS Revolution brand is supported by national, regional, and local marketing programs that include television and radio advertising, online advertising and grass roots marketing at community and sporting events. In addition, we work closely with distributors and retailers on in-store promotional programs and events.
 
BOSS Revolution Calling’s sales have traditionally been, and continue to be, strongest in the Northeastern United States and in Florida because of our extensive local distribution network and their large foreign-born populations. We continue to grow BOSS Revolution Calling’s distributor relationships and expand BOSS Revolution Calling’s retail network in other areas of the United States and Canada, including the Southwest and West Coast, where BOSS Revolution Calling historically has not had as strong of a market presence.
 
Competition
 
BOSS Revolution Calling is subject to fierce competition, and we do not expect to grow revenues and/or margins without a successful strategy and sound execution. While virtually any company offering communication services is a competitor, we face particularly strong competition from Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat-rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators, and VoIP and other “over the top”, or OTT, service providers. Outside the United States, we also compete with large state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies.
 
Many of these companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, engineering, personnel, and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and larger customer bases than we do. We may not be able to compete successfully if one or more of these companies use their substantial resources in or to affect the international prepaid calling market.
 
In addition to these larger competitors, we face significant competition from smaller prepaid calling providers.
 
From time-to-time, competitors offer rates that are substantially below ours to gain market share. In some instances, these rates are below what we believe to be the cost to provide the service. This predatory pricing can adversely affect our revenues and our gross margins.
 
The continued growth of OTT calling and messaging services such WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, and many others have adversely affected the sales of BOSS Revolution Calling and our other prepaid calling services. We expect the popularity of these IP-based services—many of which offer free voice and/or video communications provided both the caller and recipient have a broadband connection—to continue to increase, which will increase substitution for, and pricing pressure on, our BOSS Revolution Calling and other international prepaid calling offerings.
 
Many mobile operators offer unlimited international long-distance plans that include international destinations to which customers can place direct calls from their mobile phones without time limitation. These plans now include some of our most popular international destinations. The growth of these “international unlimited” plans adversely affects our revenues as these operators gain subscriber market share.

Our ability to compete successfully against these various operators and service providers stems from several factors, including:
 

■ | our interconnect and termination agreements, network infrastructure, and least-cost-routing system enable us to offer low-cost, high-quality services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our continued innovating with new plans tailored to the specific needs of different corridors and finding new ways of delivering more value to the consumers striving to connect with third parties around the globe; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our extensive distribution and retail networks provide us with a strong presence in communities of foreign-born residents, a significant portion of which purchase our services with cash; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | continued migration of our customers to our digital platform including the BOSS Revolution Calling app; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our BOSS Revolution brand is often highly visible in these communities and has a reputation for quality service and competitive, transparent pricing; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our offering of synergistic mobile top-up and payment services over the BOSS Revolution platform that customers can conveniently access from their accounts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our ability to maintain and/or to capture additional market share will remain dependent upon our ability to continue to provide competitively priced services, to maintain our distribution and retail networks, to increase usage through the BOSS Revolution Calling app, and to innovate new products and services to fit the evolving needs of our customers.
 
Carrier Services
 
Carrier Services’ revenues were $361.0 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $394.3 million in fiscal 2020, contributing 27.2% and 31.4% of Traditional Communications’ revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
 
Our Carrier Services business is one of the largest wholesale carriers of international long-distance minutes in the world.
 
Carrier Services’ telecommunications network is comprised of interconnections and commercial relationships that reach virtually every significant telecom operator globally. These relationships enable us to carry international telecommunications traffic to more than 200 countries around the world. Carrier Services’ customers include our BOSS Revolution Calling and net2phone businesses, major and niche carriers around the globe, mobile network operators, and other service providers such as call aggregators. For many of these customers, particularly the major carriers, we engage in buy-sell relationships, terminating their customers’ traffic in exchange for terminating our traffic with them.
 
Carrier Services offers competitively priced international termination rates at several quality levels. We can offer competitively priced termination services in part because of the large volumes of originating minutes generated by our BOSS Revolution Calling business, our global platform powered by proprietary software, our team of professional and experienced account managers and market makers, and the global network of interconnections and relationships with other telecom system operators around the globe. Carrier Services are marketed and sold through our internal account management team and the IDT Express digital portal.
 
Traditional Communications terminated 15.1 billion minutes in fiscal 2021, as compared to 19.4 billion minutes in fiscal 2020. Carrier Services accounted for 10.5 billion minutes and 14.4 billion minutes of the total Traditional Communications’ minutes in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
 
Carrier Services has a significant number of direct connections to Tier 1 providers in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Tier 1 providers are the largest recognized licensed carriers in a country. Direct connections improve the quality of the telephone calls and reduce the cost, thereby enabling us to generate more traffic with higher margins to the associated foreign locales. We also have direct relationships with mobile network operators, reflecting their growing share of the voice traffic market.
 
Termination rates charged by Tier 1 and other providers of international long-distance traffic have been declining for many years. Nevertheless, termination rates charged to us by individual Tier 1 carriers and mobile operators can be volatile. Termination price volatility on heavily trafficked routes can significantly impact our minutes of use and wholesale revenues.
 
In addition to offering competitive rates to our carrier customers, we emphasize our ability to offer the high-quality connections that these providers often require. To that end, we offer higher-priced services in which we provide higher-quality connections, based upon a set of predetermined quality of service criteria. These services meet a growing need for higher-quality connections for some of our customers who provide services to high-value, quality-conscious retail customers. As of July 31, 2021, Carrier Services had more than 1,900 customers and had more than 325 carrier relationships globally.

--

 

Carrier Services’ revenues are generated by sales to both postpaid and prepaid customers. Postpaid customers typically include Tier 1 carriers, mobile network operators and our most credit worthy customers. The majority of Carrier Services’ prepaid customers connect via our IDT Express portal. IDT Express focuses on delivering wholesale voice and direct inward dialing, or DID, services to small and medium size businesses domestically and internationally. IDT Express offers the convenience of a mobile self-service portal paired with dedicated account managers, all backed by customer support that is always available. Prepaid customers are typically smaller telecommunication companies as well as independent call aggregators.
 
Carrier Services also provide outsourcing services to help fixed and mobile telephony operators enhance the profitability and value of their international voice operations. Carrier Services offers these operators customized solutions, including full outsourcing, handing all inbound and outbound calls with or without switch management, and hybrid arrangements whereby the operator retains certain routes or customers directly. Pursuant to these deals, Carrier Services collaborates with the companies to provide a full range of international long-distance services to their respective customers in-country and overseas.
 
Carrier Services is subject to intense revenue and margin pressure as communications globally continues to transition away from international voice calling to video conferencing and other collaboration platforms, low-cost or free messaging services, free peer-to-peer voice calls available when both parties utilize broadband connections, and flat-rate international long-distance plans offered both by the largest mobile network operators and niche mobile virtual network operators.
 
Competition
 
The wholesale carrier industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers, primarily based on price and quality of service.
 
Carrier Services participates in a global marketplace with:
 

■ | interexchange carriers and other long-distance resellers and providers, including large carriers such as T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | historically state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies such as Telefonica, Orange SA, and KDDI; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | on-line, spot-market trading exchanges for voice minutes; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | OTT internet telephony providers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | other VoIP providers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | other providers of international long-distance services; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | alliances between large multinational carriers that provide wholesale carrier services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that Carrier Services derives a competitive advantage from several inter-related factors:
 

■ | our BOSS Revolution Calling business generates large volumes of originating minutes, which represents a desirable, negotiable asset that helps us win return traffic and obtain beneficial pricing which we can offer in the wholesale arena; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | the proprietary technologies powering our Carrier Services’ platform and, in particular, the software that drives VoIP enables us to scale up at a lower cost than many of our competitors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our professional and experienced account management; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | our extensive network of interconnects around the globe, with the ability to connect in whichever format (IP or TDM) is most feasible. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that these factors provide Carrier Services with a competitive advantage over some participants on certain routes.

Communications and Payment Network Infrastructure and Technology Development
 
We operate a global network to provide an array of telecommunications and payment services to our customers worldwide using a combination of proprietary and third-party applications. Proprietary applications include call routing and rating, customer provisioning, call management, e-commerce sites and digital platforms, product web pages, calling card features, and payment services features. Proprietary applications provide the flexibility to adapt to evolving marketplace demands without third-party software releases, and often provide advantages in capability or cost over third-party solutions.
 
Our core voice network utilizes VoIP and is interconnected, where needed, through gateways to time-division multiplexing, or TDM, networks worldwide. This hybrid IP/TDM capability allows us to interface with carriers using the lowest cost technology protocol available. To support our global reach, we operate voice switches and/or points of presence in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia. We receive and terminate voice traffic from every country in the world, including cellular, landline, and satellite calls through direct and indirect interconnects. The network includes data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, which house equipment used for both our voice and payment services, with smaller points of presence in several other countries. Our global network is monitored and operated on a continual basis by our Network Operations Center in the United States. We also make use of one of the leading cloud providers to serve as host for some of our application infrastructure.
 
Our technology organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features of our products and services, as well as the continued improvement and iteration of our existing products and services. It is also responsible for operating and scaling our proprietary calling and payment services platforms including the underlying cloud infrastructure. Our research and development investments seek to drive core technology innovation and bring new products and services to the market. Research and development employees are located in our Newark office, as well as remotely distributed. Our research and development team consist of our software engineering, product management, quality engineering, voice engineering, business intelligence, systems and development operations teams. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our products and services.
 
Our technology organization uses a number of key performance indicators to track service quality. As of July 31, 2021, our technology organization has improved our aggregate service uptime from approximately 99.9% in fiscal 2020 to approximately 99.92% for fiscal 2021. As of July 31, 2021, the defect escape ratio, a measure of quality engineering was improved for our flagship BOSS Revolution brand from 8.5% in fiscal 2020 to 5% in fiscal 2021, meaning more than 95% of product defects were detected and fixed before being released to our customers.
 
Our product offerings and go-to-market strategy continue to evolve, and we expect our product offerings to continue to become available to customers at more frequent intervals than our historical release cycles. Our Agile development methodology is characterized by a dynamic development process with more frequent revisions to a product release’s features and functions as the software is being developed. In addition, we have implemented a holistic portfolio management process, which has improved transparency and efficiency across the portfolio through a recurring cadence of business reviews.
 
REGULATION
 
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe what we believe to be the most important, but not all, current and proposed international, federal, state, and local laws, regulations, orders, and legislation that are likely to materially affect us.
 
Regulation of Telecom in the United States
 
Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over all telecommunication’s common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services. Each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to their provision of local and intrastate communications services. Local governments often indirectly regulate aspects of our communications business by imposing zoning requirements, taxes, permit or right-of-way procedures or franchise fees. Significant changes to the applicable laws or regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 

14
--

Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, that requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). In addition, beginning in October 2006, interconnected VoIP providers, such as our subsidiary net2phone, are required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. We also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service, FCC Regulatory Fees, and Local Number Portability (collectively, the Other Funds). We and most of our competitors pass through Universal Service Fund and Other Funds contributions as part of the price of our services, either as part of the base rate or, to the extent allowed, as a separate surcharge on customer bills. Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions. In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. As a result, our ability to pursue certain new business opportunities in the future may be constrained in order to maintain these exemptions, the elimination of which could materially affect the rates we would need to charge for existing services. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
Regulation of Telecom by State Public Utility Commissions
 
Our telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state, including both local and in-state long distance services are subject to the jurisdiction of that state’s public utility commission. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, generally preempts state statutes and regulations that prevent the provision of competitive services but permits state public utility commissions to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law. We are certified to provide facilities-based and/or resold long-distance service in all 50 states and facilities-based and resold local exchange service in 45 states. In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements, consumer protection measures, and obligations to contribute to universal service and other funds. Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we both pay to local exchange companies and collect from long-distance companies for terminating in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions. State commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates, or establish rates through arbitration, for interconnection, including rates for unbundled network elements. Changes in those access charges or rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business.
 
Regulation of Telecom—International
 
In connection with our international operations, we have obtained licenses or are otherwise authorized to provide telecommunications services in various foreign countries. We have obtained licenses or authorizations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. In numerous countries where we operate or plan to operate, we are subject to many local laws and regulations that, among other things, may restrict or limit the ability of telecommunications companies to provide telecommunications services in competition with state-owned or state-sanctioned dominant carriers.
 
Regulation of Internet Telephony
 
The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is generally less regulated than traditional switch-based telephony within the United States and abroad and, in many markets, is not subject to the imposition of certain taxes and fees that increase our costs. As a result, we are able, in many markets, to offer VoIP communications services at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to traditional telephone services. However, in the U.S. and abroad, there have been efforts by legislatures and regulators to harmonize the regulatory structures between traditional switch-based telephony and VoIP. This could result in additional fees, charges, taxes and regulations on IP communications services that could materially increase our costs and may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing advantages. Additionally, several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. These efforts could likewise harm our ability to offer VoIP communications services.
Money Transmitter and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations
 
Our consumer payment services offerings include money transfer and various network branded, also called “open loop”, prepaid card offerings. These industries are heavily regulated. Accordingly, we, and the products and services that we market in consumer payment services, are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including:

■ | Banking laws and regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Money transmitter and payment instrument laws and regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15
--


■ | Anti-money laundering laws; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Privacy and data security laws and regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Consumer protection laws and regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Unclaimed property laws; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Card association and network organization rules.
