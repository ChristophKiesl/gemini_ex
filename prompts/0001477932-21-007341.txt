Item 1. Description of Business
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on June 12, 2020. We are a development stage company that was formed to offer handwritten letter service via our website platform. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See “Description of Business” and “Use of Proceeds” elsewhere in this Prospectus). Our principal executive offices are located at 6 Rosemary Way, Nuneaton, United Kingdom CV10 7ST. Our phone number is +44-203-99-11-252.
 
From inception until the date of this filing, we have had very limited operating activities. Our financial statements from Inception June 12, 2020 through June 30, 2020, reports revenue of $4,970 from services rendered and a net loss of $12,530. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Incordex Corp. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Our President, Iurii Abramovici, will offer shares of our common stock to his friends, family members and business associates in United Kingdom and Europe.
 
Great Importance – A hand addressed envelope and handwritten letter suggests the sender is somebody the recipient knows. That creates an aura of great importance for the piece.
 
Personalization – A handwritten address and letter in beautiful ink creates a much more personal impression than the pre-printed variety. When people feel a personal connection to a mailing, it’s hard to resist the urge to open it.
Contact – While digital communications continues to leave a big footprint in the marketing world, people by and large still respond more readily to something they can touch. Paper communications offer touchable, ‘real’ experiences that satisfy this basic need for touch. A personalized hand addressed envelope makes this experience even more real.
Feeling of Comfort – Because hand addressed direct mail offers a personalized connection, recipients feel much more comfortable and far less ‘on their guard’ when it comes time to decide – open it or trash it.
Our Web Site

Revenue
 
We are planning to generate revenue from our customers before the website is completed. We plan to offer our letter handwritten services to business entities via direct sales. We are currently negotiating agreements with our potential customers. When our website is ready, we plan to generate revenue via direct sales and via online orders.
Competition 
 
The market for direct marketing is highly competitive. Numerous online services will compete with us. Our competitors are substantially larger and more experienced than us and have longer operating histories and have materially greater financial and other resources than us.
Marketing

We plan to focus on direct sales online as we get started. Once we build a reputation and customer base, it will be easier to attract customers. We plan to market our products mainly in Europe and US. To promote our website and services, we are planning to use On-line Directories and Databases and Social Media.
