BUSINESSES
 
Company Overview
 
Altitude International Holdings is a people-first, global wellness group comprised of multiple scalable related revenue streams creating a vertically integrated high-performance sports, education, and technology company. Our mission is to redefine and revolutionize athletic preparation and training, while providing relief, opportunity, and wellness to those that need it the most.
Altitude International, Inc.
 

Since 2017, the Company, through its operating subsidiary, Altitude International, Inc., specializes in creating uniquely engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training environments. The product line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers. Through a license agreement with Sporting Edge UK, a brand established in the United Kingdom, the Company intends to continue to expand its technology into the American marketplace, where the appetite for increasing performance in elite athletes, professional sports, equine sports, and universities and colleges is immense.
Industry Operating Environment
 
We believe the industry operating environment is ready for our products and our focus is climate-controlled rooms. The blended business approach that Altitude has adopted has substantiated our product in the marketplace through education and applied use of our systems and protocols. In the academies’ operations alone, participants attend from 40 nations around the world. Professional athletes and professional teams utilize the facilities from Europe, South America, and Asia.

Recent Development
 
Altitude is establishing its manufacturing in the United States, taking ownership of our cost to retail structure. Currently, “Made in the USA” carries weight worldwide at the consumer level.
 
The product designs licensed from Sporting Edge UK are proven and cover a wide range of room sizes. The only requirement is to change from metric to imperial sizes where necessary.
 
There are three unique elements to the Altitude Systems:
 

● | Sophisticated Touch Screen control systems capable of integrating the control of simulated altitude, temperature and humidity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A unique design of Air Separation Unit with only a single active part that provides for ultra-reliable operation and a design life of greater than fifteen years. 
● | Proven training protocols that allow the desired training benefits to be achieved. 

 
We have included some photos of what our systems look like:
 
Manufacturing consists primarily of the assembly of components into unique licensed designs.

Competition
 
Currently, the membrane-based technology is not being well used in the United States. In North America, there exist some companies that provide altitude training masks, but the equipment is on a much smaller scale intended for personal use. This type of equipment employs PSA technology, which has reliability issues and a restricted altitude capacity.
 
There have been recent climate-controlled chamber successes in therapy and rehab environments. While used in the United States and North America, much of the membrane-based technology reflects continued use on a more personal basis. The impact of COVID-19 stalled most activities for much of 2020 and 2021. However, in recent months, the Company has experienced a renewed interest in the university, college, military, and therapy sectors and professional sports teams.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
Our approach with major professional sports franchises has been an emphasis. We plan to market to franchise, college, military and therapy institutions interested in installing climate-controlled chambers in their performance facilities indicate renewed momentum for the 2022 - 2023 seasons. Our outreach utilizes far-reaching relational capital as the point of entry for prospective targets. Our products and services support junior, adult, and professional individuals.
 
Altitudes second demonstration facility to be installed and used at Club Med Academies will serve as headquarters for ALTD’s R&D center hosting junior, adult, professional individuals and teams on a daily year-round basis. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company does not own any patents directly but has access to the Sporting Edge UK intellectual property through the License Agreement, by and between the Company and Sporting Edge UK Ltd., Inc. (“Sporting Edge UK”) as discussed below.
Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business
 
Revised Sporting Edge UK Licensing Agreement

Trident Water, LLC dba Altitude Water
 

Corporate History
 
Trident Water, LLC (“Altitude Water”) was founded in the summer of 2019, and we believe it is positioned to take a prominent position in the marketplace.
 
In June 2021, Altitude Water acquired Patent No. 7272947 to protect its intellectual property regarding ozone purification in Atmospheric Water Generators. Prior to that, Altitude Water operated under a licensing agreement.
Nature of Operations
 
Altitude Water manufactures Atmospheric Water Generators (“AWGs”). They range from smaller residential, light commercial, and heavy-duty military-grade machines. The machines supply up to 12, 100, and 200 gallons of water per day. AWGs produce pure water through the condensation process. The competitive advantage of Altitude Water’s patented ozone purification process is that it keeps the water and the system free from contaminants. The water is then put through filters replenishing the calcium and magnesium minerals to make what we believe is the finest drinking water on the market today. The patented EnviroGuard™ (Ozone Generator) purification process assists the natural water cycle by infusing Ozone into the water produced from the air’s humidity. After approximately 20 minutes, the Ozone (O3) then reverts into oxygen (O2), adding additional oxygen into every glass of water. In the final step, the process adds the minerals calcium and magnesium to raise the pH (7.6 to 8.1 on average) and provides a great taste. Altitude Water’s process is green, sustainable, and lowers the carbon footprint. Through a third-party, our water machines are currently being used by many branches of the United States military (“Military”) as part of the Military’s exploratory program with atmospheric water generation. Other noted industry sectors in need of quality water solutions are targets of Altitude Water such as humanitarian organizations, NGOs, FEMA, and sustainable real estate development.

Altitude Water has made significant strides with their manufacturing, assembly, and production capabilities. The relationship with our sales arm, RussKapp has proven productive with the military, with multiple sales, including sales to the US Marines, US Army, US Navy and the US Space Force. RussKapp has also made purchases of Altitude machines that are going in regional government facilities. 
 
Altitude Water offers several levels of its AWGs at various price points, enabling it to target a larger variety of potential customers. The largest output machine is functional for large entities and institutions, whereas the smallest output model is suited for a small commercial or residential environment. The variety of products with the same patented process in each of them allows Altitude Water to create a varied customer base and to effectively market to more entities and interested parties.


Industry Operating Environment
 
AWGs extract water from humid ambient air and render it potable, making it safe for drinking. Altitude Water uses its patented process to distinguish itself from the competition by not only providing potable water but adds the element of providing oxygenated water. Altitude Water can provide the benefits of oxygenated water. It allows for better absorption for the body’s cells based on osmosis through a sustainable product that can make water even in areas where it may not always be readily available. Thus, Altitude Water operates within the pure water generation industry as well as the oxygenated water industry, carving out a unique niche product market for customers.

Competition
 
Altitude Water’s competitors include Genaq, Watergen USA, SunToWater Technologies, and Synergy Science.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
Altitude Water targets consumers have a need for pure drinking water and do not want to rely on bottled water due to storage problems and environmental issues with the plastic bottles. The market for the smaller Trident 12 model is residential and offices that have the traditional 5-gallon dispenser with bottled water. For the commercial units (T-100 and T-200), the customers need to overcome supply chain and logistical issues to have a reliable source of pure drinking water such as the United States Armed Forces and humanitarian relief organizations. The patented process within the AWGs appeals to forward-thinking, environmentally conscious clients, due to the purity of the water as well as the ability for ozonated water to cleanse bacteria from the tubing that traditional methods such as UV lights and reverse osmosis filtration are unable to address.

Altitude Wellness LLC
 

Corporate History
 
Altitude Wellness LLC (“Altitude Wellness”) was formed in 2021.
 
Nature of Operations
 
Altitude Wellness will focus on helping its future members reach their individual health goals by offering various experiences that enhance the way you look and feel. Multiple modalities ranging from altitude chambers, cryo chambers, ozone chamber, red light therapy, IV therapy, infrared sauna, and neuro feedback are just a few of the treatments that will be available. From warm and chilled eucalyptus towels when you arrive to fresh juices and healthy snacks, all is vital to the experience. The highly trained staff will include nurses, dietitians, trainers, therapists, and health specialists. Each will know the patient by name and be familiar with their profile, which will be completed on the app and available to the Experience Specialists upon each check-in. As of December 31, 2021, Altitude Wellness was not operating but anticipates being in operation in 2022.
Industry Operating Environment
 
One of the largest burdens our competitors carry are their build-out burden costs. To combat this, Altitude Wellness will use medical centers, such as our first location projected for 2022 in Sugar Land, Texas, in the range of 4,000+ square feet with approximately 10 separate offices. This will dramatically reduce costs for build out and execution. For location and start up projections, we used traditional averages of build out and office equipment. The executive team will use their relationships, construction knowledge, design expertise and smart buying power to make sure costs are held to a minimum with an outstanding product for the best pricing on look and all the equipment.
 
The value of using existing medical offices is that many are available due to the shift in demand for in-house patient contact. Parking is traditionally sufficient, locations are typically excellent, and the power and access for equipment lend itself for a perfect Altitude franchise. Target timing will be 90 days from lease signing to open for business.
 
Services
 
Altitude Wellness of the overall business will be done in 3 different revenue streams. 1. Membership Model: 300-400 members paying a monthly fee of $350 per person on average. With a firm commitment to a limited number of members, this will cause a sense of urgency and create a fear of missing out. This membership model and token-based platform is different from any other franchise on the market today. It will allow the franchise owner to know their minimum monthly revenue and budget expenses accordingly. The projections also call out for additional spending of members over and above the monthly membership cost. Corporate and group discounts of 5 or more will also help dramatically in the sales of memberships. 2. Private Pay and Corporate Model: This will include walk in business and daily rental of entire facility to corporations for their staff. 3. Franchise Model: Altitude Wellness will franchise the concept to other locations around the country. A franchise company is currently engaged for proper set up and lead generation. Altitude Wellness franchise fee will be $40,000 plus 5% of gross plus an additional advertising fee. All fees and costs as well as scheduling of equipment will be coordinated through the Altitude App, which will hold the franchisee accountable for proper fees.

Competition
 
Altitude Wellness has researched competitors in the market such as The Drip Bar, Three Degrees Infrared Light Therapy, Chill Rx Cryotherapy, and Stretch Zone to name a few. Restore Hyper Wellness is the industry leader with similar modalities, and their expansion and growth are impressive. The Restore plan is to have over 500 franchises by 2024. With over $200 billion a year spent in wellness related procedures; this industry is ready for a new leader. Altitude Wellness will be positioned to be the new leader and disrupter to the wellness industry-- shifting how we approach wellness from reactive to proactive.
Marketing and Customers
 
Altitude Wellness unique membership program allows for flexibility in outreach and awareness. By developing a marketing program focusing on influencers and celebrity types, Altitude will achieve low-cost marketing and target members of like-minded individuals. Each outreach membership will vary between the Silver, Gold and Platinum membership-- based on the success of the personality. Altitude will also have the ability to donate monthly memberships to many local organizations. The cost of donating a $250 membership is already built into our daily expenses. Accordingly, we can donate as many as 10 memberships a month without it affecting the business, some restrictions may apply.
 
Research has shown that the slowest day of the week is Tuesday. The intent is to utilize the wellness center for “renting” to local businesses for their employees done in blocks of time. Altitude will also donate the center to people in the community such as first responders, schoolteachers, victims of domestic violence and other organizations within the community to help “heal” people who may not have the means and resources to utilize our facility. The costs associated with employee wages and equipment are already built out in the cost analysis.
 
Marketing and advertising will be done on a very specific target and demographic of the area. Through Instagram and Facebook ads, a local campaign per location will be established. Altitude will also use local advertising, influencers, celebrities as well as chamber lists and relationships with corporations to secure memberships.
