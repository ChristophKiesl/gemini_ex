Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a global luxury fashion brand led by a world-class management team and a renowned, award-winning designer. Since launching his namesake brand over 35 years ago, Michael Kors has featured distinctive designs, materials and craftsmanship with a jet-set aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude. Mr. Kors’ vision has taken the Company from its beginnings as an American luxury sportswear house to a global accessories, footwear and apparel company with a presence in over 100 countries.
We operate our business in three segments — retail, wholesale and licensing — and we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on company-operated retail stores, leading department stores, specialty stores and select licensing partners. In Fiscal 2017, our retail segment accounted for approximately 57.2% of our total revenue. As of April 1, 2017, our retail segment included:

•398 retail stores in the Americas, including concessions; 
•429 international retail stores, including concessions, in Europe and Asia; and

• | our e-commerce sites in the United States ("U.S.") and Canada, as well as our newly launched e-commerce sites in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China and Japan.

In Fiscal 2017, our wholesale segment accounted for approximately 39.5% of our total revenue. As of April 1, 2017, our wholesale segment included:

•wholesale sales through approximately 1,405 department stores and 904 specialty store doors in the Americas; and
•wholesale sales through approximately 1,099 specialty stores and 199 department store doors internationally.
A small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. Net sales to our five largest wholesale customers represented 21.0% of our total revenue for Fiscal 2017 and 25.8% of our total revenue for Fiscal 2016. Our largest wholesale customer, Macy's, accounted for 8.9% of our total revenue for Fiscal 2017 and 12.7% of our total revenue for Fiscal 2016.
Our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment, through which we license to third parties certain production, sales and/or distribution rights through product and geographic licensing arrangements. In Fiscal 2017, our licensing segment accounted for approximately 3.3% of our total revenue and consisted primarily of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenses.
For additional financial information regarding our segments, see Segment Information note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We offer three primary collections: the Michael Kors Collection luxury line, the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessible luxury line and the Michael Kors Mens line. Michael Kors Collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried in many of our retail stores, as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world, including Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Holt Renfrew, among others. In 2004, we saw an opportunity to capitalize on the brand strength of the Michael Kors collection and address the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods, and we introduced MICHAEL Michael Kors, which has a strong focus on accessories, in addition to offering footwear and apparel. MICHAEL Michael Kors is carried in all of our lifestyle stores, as well as leading department stores throughout the world, including Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom, Macy’s, Harvey Nichols, Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, Lotte, Hyundai, Isetan and Lane Crawford, among others. More recently, we have begun to grow our men's business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our brand's established fashion authority and the expanding men's market. Taken together, our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image.

Industry
We operate in the global luxury goods industry. Over the past ten years, the luxury goods industry has grown and has remained resilient during economic downturns. However, the accessible luxury retail and wholesale industry has recently been challenged by a number of factors, including lower consumer traffic trends, a promotional selling environment, lower tourist travel, currency effects, restrained consumer spending and a shift in spending from personal luxury goods to luxury experiences. As a result, while accessories have remained the biggest personal luxury goods category, the level of growth within this category, while still positive, has decelerated from prior years. In addition, the consumer demand within the luxury watch and luxury apparel categories has experienced a decline. While the wholesale channel has been challenged, the retail channel has continued to grow, largely driven by the rapid growth of the e-commerce channel and increased off-price sales, which has continued to cannibalize brick and mortar retail store sales. As the overall environment has become increasingly omni-channel, increased customer engagement and tailoring merchandise to customer shopping and communication preferences have become the key ingredients to winning market share. We believe that our innovative product offerings and customer engagement initiatives make us well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the luxury accessories product category, as it is one of our primary product categories of focus, as well as to grow our sales in other product categories.
Geographic Information
We generate revenue globally through our three segments. Through our retail and wholesale segments we sell our products in three principal geographic markets: the Americas, including North America, Latin America (excluding Brazil) and the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Through our licensing segment, we enter into agreements that license to third parties the use of our brand name and trademarks, certain production rights, and sales and/or distribution rights. We have wholesale arrangements pursuant to which we sell products to our geographic licensees, including our licensees in certain parts of Asia (which were reported within our Americas wholesale operations prior to Fiscal 2016).
The following table details our net sales and revenue by segment and geographic location (in millions):

 | Fiscal Years Ended

Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors:
Global Luxury Fashion Brand Led by a World-Renowned, Award-Winning Designer. Over the years, we have transformed from an American luxury sportswear house to a global accessories, footwear and apparel company with presence in over 100 countries. Michael Kors, a world-renowned designer, personally leads our experienced design team. Mr. Kors and his team are responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all of our products, and their design leadership is a unique advantage that we possess. Mr. Kors has received a number of awards, which recognize the contribution Mr. Kors and his team have made to the fashion industry and our Company. We believe that the Michael Kors name has become synonymous with luxurious fashion that is timeless and elegant, expressed through sophisticated accessory and ready-to-wear collections. Each of our collections exemplifies the jet-set lifestyle and features high quality designs, materials and craftsmanship. Some of the most widely recognized global trendsetters—including celebrities such as Cate Blanchett, Viola Davis, Ashley Graham, Kate Hudson, Angelina Jolie, Blake Lively, Jennifer Lopez, Nicole Kidman, Taylor Swift, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the Duchess of Cambridge wear our collections. We have built a solid foundation for long-term growth through our innovative product offerings, strategically controlled retail and wholesale distribution networks, expanded digital presence and other initiatives.

Leveraging our Success in the Accessories Product Category to Grow our Brand Position in Other Product Categories. The strength of our Michael Kors luxury collection and our accessible luxury MICHAEL Michael Kors lines have allowed us to expand our brand awareness and position ourselves as one of the leading global luxury brands in the accessories product category. Capitalizing on the success of our accessories product category, we are continuing to grow and diversify our brand through other product categories, such as mens apparel and accessories, dresses, footwear and wearable technology.
Proven Multi-Format Retail Segment with Future Growth Opportunity. In Fiscal 2017, our retail segment reported net sales of $2.572 billion, which represented a 7.4% increase from net sales of $2.395 billion in Fiscal 2016. Within our retail segment we have four primary retail store formats: collection stores, lifestyle stores, outlet stores and e-commerce sites. Our collection stores are located in some of the world’s most prestigious shopping areas, such as Madison Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in California, and are generally 2,800 square feet in size. Our lifestyle stores are located in some of the world’s most frequented metropolitan shopping locations and leading regional shopping centers, and are generally 2,800 square feet in size. We also extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our outlet stores, which are generally 4,000 square feet in size. We also have e-commerce sites in the United States and Canada and have recently launched new e-commerce sites in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. During Fiscal 2018, we plan to launch e-commerce sites in South Korea, as well as in additional countries in Europe. In addition to these four retail store formats, we operate concessions in a select number of department stores in North America and internationally. 
Strong Relationships with Premier Wholesale Customers. We partner with leading wholesale customers, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Holt Renfrew, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s in North America, as well as Harvey Nichols, Printemps, Selfridges and Galeries Lafayette in Europe. These relationships enable us to access large numbers of our key consumers in a targeted manner. Our "shop-in-shops" have specially trained staff, as well as customized fixtures, wall casings, decorative items, and flooring, and provide department store consumers with a more personalized shopping experience than traditional retail department store configurations. We are also engaged with our wholesale customers on various initiatives and have entered into new innovative supply chain partnerships with our wholesale customers designed to increase the speed at which our products reach the ultimate consumer. During Fiscal 2017, we began to strategically reduce shipments to decrease promotional activity within our wholesale channel. While we believe that this is necessary to appropriately position our brand long-term, net sales for our wholesale segment decreased by 17.2% from $2.144 billion in Fiscal 2016 to $1.776 billion in Fiscal 2017.
Innovative Product Offerings from our Licensing Segment. The strength of our global brand has been instrumental in helping us build our licensing business. We collaborate with a select number of product licensees who produce and sell what we believe are products requiring specialized expertise that are enhanced by our brand strength, including Fossil Partners, LP. (“Fossil”) for watches and jewelry, Aramis and Designer Fragrances division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (“Estée Lauder”) for fragrances and beauty and Luxottica Group ("Luxottica") for eyewear, among others. While total revenue for licensed products declined from $173.3 million in Fiscal 2016 to $145.8 million in Fiscal 2017, primarily due to declines related to watch and jewelry product categories and lower geographic licensing revenues due to our acquisitions of the previously licensed operations in Greater China and South Korea, we have continued to introduce new and innovative product offerings in collaboration with our licensees, including the new line of Access smartwatches and other connected accessories launched in Fiscal 2017, as well as new fragrance offerings, including Wonderlust, Sexy Blossom and Turquoise. During Fiscal 2018, we plan to introduce additional fragrance and smartwatch offerings in collaboration with our licensees.
Proven and Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines in the retail industry, including design, sales, marketing, public relations, merchandising, real estate, supply chain and finance. With an average of 27 years of experience in the retail industry, including at a number of public companies, and an average of ten years with Michael Kors, our senior management team has strong creative and operational experience and a successful track record. This extensive experience extends beyond our senior management team and deep into our organization.

• | introducing new mobile technologies across our retail store and e-commerce network with enhanced styling and wardrobe-building tools and customer-preferred communication capabilities; and


• | introducing a new customer loyalty program, which we are planning to pilot during Fiscal 2018.

Advertising and Marketing
Our marketing strategy is to deliver a brand and product message that is consistent with the Michael Kors brand image across all customer touch points on their path from brand consideration through purchase. Our global image is created and executed internally by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, which helps ensure the consistency of our message.
In Fiscal 2017, we recognized approximately $118.7 million in advertising and marketing expenses globally. We engage in a wide range of integrated marketing programs, across various marketing channels including but not limited to email marketing, print advertising, outdoor advertising, online marketing, social media, direct print mailings, public relations outreach, visual merchandising and partnership marketing, in an effort to engage our existing and potential customer base and ultimately stimulate sales in a consumer-preferred shopping venue. In addition, our spring and fall ready-to-wear collections, along with our latest accessories, are showcased at New York Fashion Week. The semi-annual runway shows also generate extensive media coverage.
The growing number of visitors to our e-commerce websites provides an opportunity to increase the size of our customer database and to communicate with our consumers to increase online and physical store sales, as well as build brand awareness. Our mobile optimized e-commerce sites feature the Michael Kors lifestyle images, which allows us to better engage new and existing customers and create innovative ways to keep the brand at the forefront of consumers’ minds by offering a broad selection of products, including accessories, apparel, and footwear. Since e-commerce growth is critical to our overall growth strategy, we continued to expand our global e-commerce presence by launching new e-commerce sites in six European countries, China and Japan during Fiscal 2017, and plan to launch e-commerce sites in additional countries in Europe and South Korea during Fiscal 2018.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
We contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent third-party manufacturing contractors, whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. We allocate product manufacturing among third-party agents based on their capabilities, the availability of production capacity, pricing and delivery. We have relationships with various agents who source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. Although our relationships with our manufacturing contractors or agents are generally terminable at any time, we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with these third parties. In Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, one third-party agent sourced approximately 13.9% and 14.9% of our finished goods purchases, respectively. In Fiscal 2017, by dollar volume, approximately 96.3% of our products were produced in Asia and Europe. See “Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations” and Item 1A. —“Risk Factors” — “We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.”
Manufacturing contractors and agents operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing divisions and buying agents headquartered in North America, Europe and Asia. All products are produced according to our specifications. Production staff monitors manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Quality assurance is focused on as early as possible in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.
Distribution
Our primary distribution facility in the U.S. is the 1,284,420 square foot leased facility in Whittier, California, which we operate directly and services our retail stores, e-commerce site, and our wholesale operations in the U.S. We also engage in omni-channel order fulfillment by filling online orders through our retail stores and through our click-and-collect service offerings. Our primary distribution facility in Europe is our new Company-owned and operated 1,108,680 square foot distribution facility in Holland, which began during Fiscal 2017 to support our European operations, including the newly launched e-commerce sites. We are also in the process of transitioning out of our previous third-party operated distribution facility in Holland and anticipate to be fully transitioned to our Company-owned facility by the middle of Fiscal 2018.We also have a regional distribution center in Canada, which is leased, as well as regional distribution centers in China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are operated by third-parties.

Intellectual Property
We own the Michael Kors and MICHAEL Michael Kors trademarks, as well as other material trademark rights related to the production, marketing and distribution of our products, both in the United States and in other countries in which our products are principally sold. We also have trademark applications pending for a variety of related marks and logos. We aggressively police our trademarks and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels through leads generated internally, as well as through our network of customs authorities, law enforcement, legal representatives and brand specialists around the world.
Pursuant to an agreement entered into by Mr. Kors in connection with the acquisition by our former principal shareholder of a majority interest in the Company in 2003, Mr. Kors (i) represented that all intellectual property rights used in connection with the Company’s business at such time were owned exclusively by the Company, (ii) assigned to the Company (to the extent not already assigned to and owned by the Company) exclusive worldwide rights in perpetuity to the “Michael Kors” name and trademark and all derivations thereof, as well as to Mr. Kors’ signature and likeness, and all goodwill associated therewith, (iii) agreed not to take any action against the Company inconsistent with such ownership by the Company (including, without limitation, by asserting any privacy, publicity or moral rights) and (iv) agreed not to use, whether or not he is employed by the Company, any of such intellectual property in connection with any commercial enterprise (provided that he may use the name Michael Kors as his legal name only, and not as service mark or trade name, to identify himself personally and to engage in charitable activities and other activities that do not compete with any businesses of the Company).
Employees
At the end of Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately 13,702, 12,689 and 11,094 total employees, respectively. As of April 1, 2017, we had approximately 7,048 full-time employees and approximately 6,654 part-time employees. Approximately 11,467 of our employees were engaged in retail selling and administrative positions, and our remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business as of April 1, 2017. None of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Competition
We face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate from both, existing and new competitors. Our products compete with other branded products within their product category. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, customer service, quality, brand prestige and recognition, among other bases. In our wholesale business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of accessories, footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display. Moreover, the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. We believe, however, that we have significant competitive advantages because of our brand recognition and the acceptance of our brand name by consumers. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors" — "The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within North America and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline.”
Seasonality
We experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our wholesale and retail segments. Our wholesale segment generally experiences its greatest sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters while our first fiscal quarter experiences the lowest sales. Our retail segment generally experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter as a result of Holiday season sales. In the aggregate, our first fiscal quarter typically experiences significantly less sales volume relative to the other three quarters and our third fiscal quarter generally has higher sales volume relative to the other three quarters.

Import Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations
Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. government is also considering the imposition of a border adjustment tax. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that, in such increased quantities, cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as “anti-dumping” actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the United States government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a United States industry. We are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"). See Item 1A. “Risk Factors" — "We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.”
Accessories, footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries by governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing and product safety. We are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations. Similarly, accessories, footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the U.S. and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters in the near future. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
We are also required to comply with the disclosure requirements under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to the use of conflict minerals in our products. As a result, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with this rule.
Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
